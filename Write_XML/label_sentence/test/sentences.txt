i	numb?	i cant imagine how many days i have wasted to being sad and crying and not being able to accomplish the things i need to do.  i have responsibilities i have deadlines and none of them seem to matter when i am in these dark episodes.  how can you force yourself to do what needs to be done when you feel so hopeless and numb?
i	!!	i have never been in this low mental state beforeedit: i read every comment you all are so wholesome?!! !  you are the best people on earth ! this subreddit is full of amazing people who understand each other!2 edit: thank you for gifts !!
tired	everything doesn't seem to excite me anymore	i hate how people who i thought knew better tell me that i'm lazy, i'm not.  i wanna get up and be excited to do stuff but i'm just not.  i'm  <e1> tired </e1>  all the time and  <e2> everything doesn't seem to excite me anymore </e2> . 
i	reading.	i never asked to be brought on this world, and yet i'm expected to be a normal adult and get a job, move out and maintain relationships (things that i've never known how to do).  i feel like if i'll be by myself for a month i'll end it all honestly.  i never asked for any of this.  people think this excuse is playing the victim game, and they may be right, but why the fuck is suicide bad then? am i supposed to rot on the streets instead? i'm just angry and i hate this.  thanks for reading. 
mistakes	deaths of those i love	what is even the fucking point anymore? i took my bird out when the door was open and it flew off my shoulder.  in a moment of panic i slammed the door. . .  right onto his head.  everyone in my family is telling me its not your fault and it was a mistake, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? me.  and now my  <e1> mistakes </e1>  are causing the  <e2> deaths of those i love </e2> .  i hate myself so much i dont even see the point of going on anymore. edit: oh my god, thank you everyone! its been a really hard day and the support ive had from my family and you guys has helped a lot.  its still an on going process, but im trying not to blame myself for it.  hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know i wasnt alone in this and that it is possible to move on.  thanks guys :)
every	fail.	every day when i wake up, i feel suuuuper depressed for the first few hours of being up.  for the rest of the day it comes and goes but its every morning without fail. 
i cant do this alone	dont give up on me	im trying.  i havent been happy in five years, but im trying.  i think about suicide every day, but im still here.  im hanging on.  im trying to believe that maybe ill find happiness again.  maybe i will find faith gain.  maybe one day i will find people who care.  i know you see me struggling and i feel you look at me with eyes of disdain.  i hear your thoughts.  shes a lost cause shes too much i wish i had never talked to her i know you dont like me and you would probably be happier without me but im begging for someone to please stick around.  to please not pull out.  even if you just pretend to care please  <e2> dont give up on me </e2>  and maybe even just pretend to believe that i can get better.  because  <e1> i cant do this alone </e1>  - and if everyone around me leaves, then why should i stay?edit: thanks for the awards and support.  it means a lot.  ??
everyone relating to this actually made me feel a little better	thanks to everyone	one minute youre fine and the next you feel so down that you cant even get up or think or do anything and all for no fucking reason.  like nothings wrong but you just feel so down for no reason.   it legit makes no sense. update:  <e1> everyone relating to this actually made me feel a little better </e1> , so  <e2> thanks to everyone </e2> .  i hope you guys feel better. 
i	though.	i hate that phrase, and i mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesnt actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better for trying to helpas someone who is depressed suicide isnt an option on the table for me yet,  but when it comes to it the only thing im gonna hear or read if someone says that to me is that its a solutionedit:  sorry.   the phrase is suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemdoesnt change anything i just said though. 
pushed myself too hard in the past	exhausted	i suck at everything in my life even if i try to work my hardest.  i  <e1> pushed myself too hard in the past </e1>  and now im too <e2>  exhausted </e2> .  slowly rotting away on the inside.  im not the person i once was.  i have forgotten who that was anyway.  all thats left is a depressed, anxious mess. 
when	day.	when i first heard of suicide and suicidal thoughts i wondered who the fuck does that.  now that fuck is me.  never knew i would be the one wanting to die and postpones my suicide each day. 
suicidal thoughts	put me in an hospital	i told my mom about my  <e1> suicidal thoughts </e1> .  she quickly proposed to  <e2> put me in an hospital </e2> . fuck.  you.  i'm not crazy, i don't need to be restrained, if i kill myself, i assure you, you will not be able to stop me. i need meds, i need attention, i need you to listen. edit: thank you for your replies.  i can't reply to everybody, so i'm just going say important things here. i already see a psychologist, i'm searching  psychiatrist, and aside from this kind of proposition, my mom isn't bad.  i'm talking about this to other people.  i was just angry about this stupid proposition of her. 
the	.	the fact that most people are not depressed, most people don't wish to die everyday is actually bewildering.  like i really have no idea how that is like. . . i'm not saying most people are productive or happy, but they're okay with being alive and want to live, they have a social life (maybe) and have enough mental power to do what needs to be done. that's most people. . . .  on the internet there are a lot of depressed folk like myself so it starts to feel normal.  but it's not.  and that's crazy to me. in the last 2 years, not a single day went by without me wanting to kill myself, genuinely.  for a long time the moment i wake up i feel. . .  dread? no reason at all i can suddenly cry while doing things like exercising.  sometimes i can't cry at all.  for the whole of today i've been on my bed, occasional tears but no crying, falling asleep and waking up feeling the worst.  i have things to do ffs. . . 
hate my major	spend all my day on reddit or youtube or doing homeworks which i don't enjoy	i feel so damn old.  i'm 22 years old woman but mentally i'm 50yo unemloyed alcoholic whose wife left.  every day when i wake up (which is usually around 11-12 am) i think shit here we go again.  i get up and while brushing my teeth i think about all my failures and cringy moments in my life.  i <e2>  spend all my day on reddit or youtube or doing homeworks which i don't enjoy </e2>  because i  <e1> hate my major </e1> .  sometimes i think about things i could do but then i'm like naah what's the point.  my depression was already treated (i'm still taking ads) but now i'm afraid it's coming back.  i have no motivation to do anything.  i am even too lazy to play games or watch a movie? seriously who is too letargic to watch a movie? i just feel like i'm too old and my life is over.  i feel so useless.  i would like to have a child and every day i'm scared that i'm getting older and older and i can't even find a stable relationship.  i am too lazy to think about how to end this post i'm sorry. 
cry	hopeless and small	today i'm alonei sit by myself in the dark and wonder if it's always going to be like this. today i feel like nothing i do has meaningthat nothing matters in the end, and there is no happy ending for anyone. today i  <e1> cry </e1> because i feel <e2>  hopeless and small </e2> , and there is no one here to tell me it gets better. today i don't want to existeverything is too loud and i get lost in my thoughts with nothing to distract me from it. today i feel homesicki miss the place where i grew up, the place where i laughed as a child and hugged my parents. 
i have been depressed	i am getting behind on my homework	i think  <e1> i have been depressed </e1>  for a long time, and  <e2> i am getting behind on my homework </e2>  once again.  does anyone have a suggestion about how i should do my homework when i dont even feel like waking up each day?
i	it.	i stay in bed all day and never build the motivation to brush my teeth.  yesterday a big chunk of my back molars chipped off.  i simply took it out and tossed it.  my other molar have a huge decay cavity in it.  i'm too ashamed to tell anyone and go to the dentist to get shamed by a dentist about it. 
guilty	burdening someone to the point of this doing this	i have a friend that asks me almost every single day if i have had breakfast.  he bugs me if i havnt.  i don't know how the heck to even deal with nice people.  i don't know how to acceptpeople being caring and kind.   i don't feel i deserve this care and being checked on daily just makes me feel  <e1> guilty </e1>  that i'm  <e2> burdening someone to the point of this doing this </e2> .   i don't tell him anything. .   i think he just picks up on it. .  but goddamn i hate when people r nice lol. 
depressive symptoms	failure, lonely, unloved, incredibly ugly, numb, empty	some days i will be at my lowest point, feeling like a <e2>  failure, lonely, unloved, incredibly ugly, numb, empty  </e2> and you know, the usual  <e1> depressive symptoms </e1> .  and then other days ill completely suppress all those emotions to the point where i pretend like im completely fine and as if im normal.  it makes me question whether im actually even depressed or just faking it bc i want to be?? or i just want attention?? but then it all comes back after a few days/weeks and it hits me like a truck
i	quiet.	i feel as calm as i can be when its dark and quiet. 
laid in bed	didn't have enough energy to watch tv or look at my phone	i never thought i would be here but last night i  <e1> laid in bed  </e1> for 7 or 8 hours because i <e2>  didn't have enough energy to watch tv or look at my phone </e2>  but i wasn't physically tired enough to sleep. i always thought that watching tv took zero energy, but it turns out that you do, in fact, have to put in some effort to focus on the plot and what's going on. i want to want to do stuff.  today has been better, but i still feel so meh.  how can i do homework and hold a job when i can barely summon the will to get up to go to the bathroom? depression really is a crippling illness. i've never experienced such intense apathy.  right now my husband and i are living with his parents and if they kicked us out and we were homeless i straight up would not care.  i would not mind going down to the river near our house and laying down to die. it's fuckin' crazy, man. edit: i'm simultaneously comforted and really sad that i'm not alone in feeling like this.  take care of yourselves.  fwiw i have bipolar rather than straight depression, and today i'm on an upswing (i'm not gonna kms)
being sad, depressed/ pessimistic isnt cool	more people are depressed than actually admit it	been trying to cure or fix my deep depression for a long time, but it occurred to me, its unnatural, maybe im depressed because the bad outweighs the good, nothing we do actually means much, we get old, sick and die.  people are animals, life just sucks. i also have a theory that  <e2> more people are depressed than actually admit it </e2> , because <e1>  being sad, depressed/ pessimistic isnt cool  </e1> and its a sign of an unsuccessful person to a lot of people. life overall is way more bad than good, dont see how anyone can argue otherwise.  trying to cure depression feels like trying to put blinders on.  trying to trick yourself.  thoughts anyone? all replies are appreciated.  hope everyone has a decent day. 
i	hard.	i wanna die i wanna kill myself i can't stop thinking about suicide even if i don't plan to do it.  i'm just in extreme mental pain and my brain is screaming that the only way to shut it down is to die, and whatever i do i hear this voice and i have these thoughts.  as soon as i'm doing something or try to think about something my brain freezes intensively and i can only think i want to die.  it's like even thinking is too hard. 
pain was gone	happy	like i was drunk last night, and for the first time, the  <e1> pain was gone </e1> .  i forgot how much of a fuck up i was.  i was  <e2> happy </e2>  for the first time in a very long time. this cant be healthy.  helpedit: thanks all for the kind words.  i didn't think this would get so much attention. 
the	me.	the dream felt so real and vivid.  i was running down a list of suicide methods trying to figure out pros and cons of each (like i do in real life) and eventually settled on one.  it wasn't what i'd choose in real life but it was the winner in dream world.  i remember being nervous but not scared.  then i just went through with it and woke up right as i guess i died. i just wish real me was as bold as dream me. 
like	ofhah	like im fine for a bit, just living life, then ill lie down and suddenly something just hits fast and hits hardand then im breathing heavily with pain all across my body.  im lying there with every part in agony and i want to kill myselfit makes me want to slash open my face or cut open my arms or tear my stomach.  just normal things that normal people think ofhah
devastated	i left this life	i only have a few people who care about me.  i know they would be  <e1> devastated </e1>  if  <e2> i left this life </e2> , and i feel like they are all i have that helps me to hold on for just a little longer.  if i lost them, either literally or if they lost my trust, respect, etc, i wouldn't even hesitate to end it all. i'm writing this at 1am, days away from my 23rd birthday, and i feel like i'm ready to end my life. i want to go, but i can't.  my loved ones won't let me go, and i can't let go of them.  i feel stuck and i don't know what to do.  i wish there was an easy way out of this. edit: i just want to say a very big thank you to everyone for all of your replies to my post.  i woke up this morning to see some very heartfelt, supportive messages, and it is things like that that i appreciate with all my heart, and inspires me to keep going.  thank you, for taking some time out of your day to write to me.  that means the world to me. and thank you to those who gifted me with the awards and reddit premium.  i've never had premium before! it made me smile seeing that.  ? thank you. . .  ?
it	again.	it happens to me often.  i feel happy in my dreams.  when it's morning and i have to face the world, even if i know that i'll stay at home all day, i say to myself; damn it's morning again. 
rant:yes	/rant	rant:yes i'm sad, and i'm angry.  i hate being alone.  i want friends.  i want to be social.  i want to feel accepted.  i'm so fucking depressed and i'm trying so hard to actually forge meaningful relationships but everyone is all talk and it goes nowhere.  we should hang out but somehow never materializes.  i feel so fucking alone and isolated.  i just get to sit on social media and watch everyone else hang out.  what a life that is.  and the thing that makes me the most angry is i know if i kill myself, all of these people will come out and say i wish we'd have known sooner or parade around how important mental health awareness is.  meanwhile they just shunned me when i tried to reach out.  it seems to be common story.  it's easy to say you wish you could have helped someone after they're dead and there's nothing to do.  quite something else when they're still alive and suffering. /rant
sure	??	sure i have a good couple of days or even moments.  but it always comes back to me. . .  the feeling of being all alone in a crowded room.  feeling like im homesick but no place feels like home.  feeling like im drowning on the really bad days.  i dont know if its the lockdown making it all that much worse but i think i need therapy and meds for real.  i just havent been able to actually commit to it. update : thank you for the awards and all the kind comments.  it truly helps knowing im not alone in feeling this way.  i hope all of you who are like me and feeling lost and sad and confused get help too.  none of us deserve to suffer like this.  wishing you all a happy holiday and sending hugs from afar ??
does	itthanks	does anyone here experience this? i struggle to feel good about my life in general, simple tasks are so hard yet i'm always acting happy and going to work while i am deeply unsatisfied with my life but i can't pinpoint why i am feeling this way. how do i shake this or even better my life to resolve itthanks
killing	myself	killing myself is inevitable.  i want to end it.  have no partner or any close friends.  no one i talk to on the regular.  i have no one to impress or talk to.  i have no one.  its so painful and i will be this way for the rest of my life.  i cannot keep friends.  i can barely make them.  there has to be something wrong with me, because this is not normal.  i am not normal. i cant figure it out.  why no one loves me or sticks around.  why i have no friends nor relationship.  people always tell me good things about myself but i constantly wonder why i have no one around me.  i'm sad and im lonely and i just want to kill myself.  it is so painful waking up everyday knowing im a defect that no one can bare or love.  i hate my life and i want to kill myself
i	up.	i almost killed myself today.  i was done.  i was tired, and i could visualize the peace that i was about to have.  i could almost feel it already, the quiet and the calm.  i went outside to sit in the middle of my back yard, my s&w 38 in my pocket.  i sat it down on the ground in front of me, took two deep breaths, and let the rain hit my face one last time.  i have no idea what stopped me.  i just burst into tears.  this was roughly five hours ago, and i cant stop crying.  i dont know what to do.  i have no one.  i wish i had just finished the job before i chickened out.  i cant even kill myself correctly.  i really cant do anything without messing it up. 
violent thoughts	put me into a mental hospita	i hate everything, i hate working, i hate school, i hate interacting with people, i dont want to do anything but sit on the balcony of an apartment and look at the view, im going to be a wagecuck anyways, and i cant think or type for shit, im doing just horrid in school.  i hope either i die or this world ends soon.  and because of recent  <e1> violent thoughts </e1>  i have predicted that they might <e2>  put me into a mental hospita </e2> l, i dont actually care.  its for the better. 
can't see ghost	glad	as the product of african slaves and native taino  that has gone through so much and still managed to thrive. . . . i'm an absolute failure on all fronts.  my ancestors and living relatives faced down abuse, addiction and bad choices and they are all doing so well now.  when i get pinned down i stay down instead of fight back and when i try to be strong i fuck it up with horrible decisions.   so weak, so stupid, deformed and cannot be anymore unwanted i'm  <e2> glad </e2>  i <e1>  can't see ghost </e1>  because they're probably staring down me in shame.  hell my grandmother is going blind and riddled with diabetes & arthritis and yet hasn't stopped working for 40+ years.  i'm a fucking embarrassment.  i feel like dying just thinking about it. edit: thank you for the kinds words even though i don't feel them.  i'm not religious but i'd love if my ghost ancestors could give me the lottery numbers
depressed	using sleep to cope with it	i've been severely  <e1> depressed </e1>  the past week and i've noticed that i've been <e2>  using sleep to cope with it </e2> .  you see, when i sleep, all the sadness and all the emotional pain go away during the time i'm asleep.  it's kind of if i was dead, not actually, but you know what i mean.  some days i've been sleeping up to 13 hours.  i know it's not good for me, but to be completely honest, i'm way past the point of caring what and what is not good for me. 
right	this?	right so sometimes out of nowhere speaking just makes me feel tired and i have a really strong urge to just not do it.  i know ive been like this since about 13 cant remember if it was like this before aswell.  i get really frustrated when im like this because people expect you to talk and i really dont want to and i dont want people to think im mad at them but then i do get pissed because speaking makes me tired and then im snappy and tired because i forced myself to speak anyways does anyone else get this?
i	place.	i never asked to be born.  to be tortured by my own mind and other peoples awful behavior everyday.  i dont want to suffer.  i dont want to live or die.  dying, just ceasing to exist, seems terrifying to me.  i just wanna hide and wish i was never born in the first place. 
my nails they look so pretty	happy	it doesn't seem like much and it isn't really.  i've been going through a hard time recently but now when i randomly catch sight of  <e1> my nails they look so pretty </e1>  and it makes me  <e2>  happy  </e2> 
introverted and kind of insecure	feel like nobody likes/wants me	hi everyone. i'm a really  <e1> introverted and kind of insecure  </e1> guy, and often  <e2> feel like nobody likes/wants me </e2> , i just don't get it why i can't seem to get a girlfriend.  i tried self reflecting but i just can't seem to find what is wrong with me, and why it is the way it is. . .  maybe i'm depressed but i don't know either.  i do know that over time i subconsciously built a mindset of being defensive/hating people who i feel like hate me.  i also know that whenever i get contact with a girl (once every 2 years or so), i get desperate and clingy and fuck it all up. . .  i just don't know what the difference is between everyone easily getting on with other people, and i'm just here lonely feeling like a loser. edit: i have a profile picture to see what i look like.  look at it and realise i still haven't even kissed a girl. . .  what is wrong with me. . . 
sorry	again	sorry if not allowed, im just trying to understand my depressive boyfriend.  long story short, he was the sweetest guy ive met, and did everything to let me know how much he cared.  but after some time he went from loving to a cold person, and whats weird is that even when he became cold, he still made plans to come visit me in my city, and surprisingly gave me all the love and attention, but right after he went back to his city his personality (at least over text) was still the same hollow and cold person, and then he told me about his depression and how he doesnt always feel like himself when hes depressive.  when he visited me, he did let me know how much i mattered to him, i just found it weird that as soon as he went back to his city he just went back to his cold self again
money	ps5.	money can't buy you happiness if i'm gonna be depressed, then at least i'd be depressed in a comfortable house with a ps5. 
title	friends!!!!!!!!!!!	title i guess lol. i left socials and feel great! might be a manic episode but you know i don't carefeel free to add me friends!!!!!!!!!!!
i	life	i tested positive and while its a small chance i hope it kills me i honestly got kinda excited and still am i dont wanna kill myself but its the only option i guess im done with life
i	this?	i dont feel like i want help with my depression and the thought of being a happy person kinda scares me.  i feel like i want to to get worse and kill myself.  idk does anyone else feel like this?
i	disappointed	i remember this guy commented on one of my posts saying.  more depressed redditer syndrome.  quit being such a depressed asshole he was a dick but hes right i just post how i want to kill myself and how im going to do it over and over but i never do.  i always say i will but i never do im sick of living im such a failure i just live for buying things and thats all i do.  i literally do nothing else besides buy/collect stuff and listen to music.  my mom is so loving and supportive but she must be so disappointed
i	it	i just can't take it anymore.  i've spent all day every day thinking about ending it all for the last decade and it's just too much for me to take anymore.  i don't know what to do, part of me wants to check myself in somewhere but i'm worried all my friends and family will judge me and it'll worsen everything.  i just don't know what to do anymore if anyone has any experience in a psych ward, or just has any general advice i'd really appreciate it
many people will hate me	saying this	i am shy introvert person.  i have infj personality. l have social anxiety. i don't have any passion or goal in life. i want to earn money and leave stressful life.  people call selfish those who leave their country but they are the ones who break relationships for money.  the reality of life is really money , <e1> many people will hate me </e1>  for  <e2> saying this </e2>  but its true.  anyone can do sweet talking and say money isn't everything.  it is hypocrisy.  i want to leave india but there will be no one to take care of my parents.  both gone through clinical depression in their life. it happened before 10-15yrs. my father is 60yrs old and still using antidepressants and sleeping pills daily. yeah time doesn't fix everyone.   i just want to leave this place and settle in foreign to start new life but i always gone through depression and loneliness ,so moving abroad will worsen everything. 
im	depressed	im proud of myself.  now back to living in bed depressed
irritable	without anti depressants	i am pretty much alone in this .  i feel very  <e1> irritable </e1>   <e2> without anti depressants </e2>  . i have also strated losing interest in everything .   i found one anti depressant particularly effective in subsiding my suicidal ideation.   my doctor strongly believes i don't need antidepressants long term but i feel the opposite.   he has also been inefficient in helping me control my weight gain. i have no idea what to do .  whenever i feel better he , stops my medication .  i just want a doctor to keep me on meds forever . 
im	pointless.	im recently doubting everything.  my life, career, that i have never spent enough time with friends and instead i hustled and worked on my career.  im financially stable but very lonely.  for past couple of years it was hard for me to just live, without achieving and studying.  im drained and spend most of my days crying and trying to push through.  i was diagnosed with depression and told my boss.  theyre very supportive which is one good thing.  i really dont know how to make myself happy, i feel like a lonely piece of trash.  i cant eat and mostly sleep whenever i can.  as an overachiever, if i knew what would make me happy id do it.  but i dont know.  being around with people only helps for a little while.  i wish i belonged somewhere.  i hustled through my career and now feel lonely and pointless. 
act like i'm perfectly fine	no one actually knows just how bad it is	at this point in my life i am seriously depressed and i feel like i'm in a hole i can't climb out of no matter what i do.  i can't remember anything that happens, i have no motivation to do even the things that i love doing, i can't focus, i can't bring myself to even properly take care of myself.  i'm not the type of person to have suicidal thoughts even when i am this depressed but i really need to find a way to continue.  i can't keep up in school and am 4 weeks behind on my work but i can't focus enough nor have the motivation and i also just can't remember enough to actually do the assignments.  my life is falling apart and my coping mechanism is to  <e1> act like i'm perfectly fine </e1>  so  <e2> no one actually knows just how bad it is </e2> .  i need help even if it's just random people on reddit and idk if this is even the right place to post this. 
i	thoughts	i am m 23 from india currently suffering from depression and having suicidal thoughts
i ruined it in the span of a minute	i got frustrated	my marriage is falling apart.  im too much like my father.  i saw too much of how he treated my mother when i was growing up, and even if i didnt want it to, it left an impression on me.  she deserves better.  im not a good man, im not a good husband, and i can never fix myself.  im no good at being married, i cant give her the dreams she has.  im a horrid, intolerable person and i feel as though i dont deserve to live any longer.  everything was great today.  everything was great yesterday.  everything has been great for the past month.   <e1> i ruined it in the span of a minute </e1>  because  <e2> i got frustrated </e2> , and called her intolerable.  i took my frustrations out during a time in which she needed my support, and now she wont talk to me.  i have this sinking, empty ache in my chest.  i want to be better. . . 
as	thanks	as of recently i've been finding how i can't shake the underlying belief or notion that loss is inevitable for me, and that my existence is meant to be suffering and loss and it is all that it ever was meant to be.  i feel that the people in my life are ready and willing to leave or give up on me at any moment, and some in fact hate me as a person and find me unbearable, but only keep in touch with me so they can use me. exactly with what would you associate this empty, lost, alone, and completely doomed feeling that lays under the surface? i can guess all day and i'm not asking for a dx, but i'm not too in tune with some symptom sets of certain disorders and i would appreciate some perspective. thanks
i don't feel sad	i have nothing to be sad about	does anyone else feel extremely empty inside? like when there isn't work to do or distractions; you just feel extremely empty or is your default mode just happy?  <e1> i don't feel sad </e1>  because  <e2> i have nothing to be sad about </e2>  but i do feel empty and sometimes just no hope.  life just isn't exciting to me anymore

they know i have no friends	they take advantage of me and make me their servant	23m alone in life with self doubt inherited by parents who shame me for being different than them.  they are the dumbest, fakest, most hateful people i know; they treat me like a dog on a leash and  <e1> they know i have no friends </e1>  so  <e2> they take advantage of me and make me their servant </e2> .  i want to break free from them (we live in different states),  but my life is so empty that all i see when i close my eyes is their endless nonsense and yapping.  the real issue is that they are a reflection of the world to me; most of humanity is as stupid and vile as them.  so why live? theres clearly no hope anywhere.  things get worse by the minute.  if only i could make friends or have anyone to enjoy life with.  i wish i had ambition, passion, things that excite me.  instead im just a slave to two idiots. 
i was vomiting	i needed meds to calm my stomach	i have checked in a looooot of tests, checked the symptoms, etc, and i have found that i do have it, but the thing is i cant go out bc of quarantine, and i dont know if i can even afford a psichologist, i think my dad hates me and i only feel sadness and pain for about 5 years now, what should i do, note in case it is important for advice: for arround 2-4 years i have added to the mix suicidal thoughts and for 5 years add constant stress to the point where almost everyday i get headaches and i once even got sick to the point  <e1> i was vomiting </e1>  and i think  <e2> i needed meds to calm my stomach </e2> . 
rethinking	way?	rethinking the past or present, being hopeful about things, or even feeling good about something that just happened i can do.  but its like in the present i cannot allow myself to be at peace.  it feels like death somehow.  like i must be worried and at least a little anxious or im not myself.  letting go of that feels like dying somehow.  why does part of me want to be this way?

ive	you.	ive been doing counseling sessions every week for a year now.  my counselor decided it would be best to make an appointment with a physiatrist.  ever since i started counseling ive been lying about  not having suicidal thoughts and my constant feeling of disinterest.  i dont want to live like this.  i just want to get my life back.  im scared to say anything about my depressive tendencies and suicidal thoughts but i know this is a good chance to take so i can possibly get on meds or get any other help.  it would be my first ever time saying saying anything about what goes on in my mind.  my anxiety is through the roof thinking about what to do.  im scared that they might start getting personal. i dont know how to talk to people like that.  its so terrifying to me.  does anybody know if its actually worth it to open up? or what other type of questions they ask? i feel like the worst possible thing that could happen is me getting admitted somewhere or crying whilst trying to answer questions without knowing how to answer them.  my mind is scrambled right now.  any comment is highly appreciated, thank you.

its all a goal we want to achieve	we lie and we act and parade in its costume	i feel that the idea of happiness is unobtainable for everyone and its just a communication ritual.  we fake our over the top greetings and our smiles in family photos and our social media posts about jogs and brunches.   <e1> its all a goal we want to achieve </e1>  so  <e2> we lie and we act and parade in its costume </e2> .  i feel like im tired of trying to put on that suit anymore, that just being depressed and isolated is correct.  at least for me.  and maybe im ok with just accepting that im a depressed piece of shit that doesnt have to chase those moments you see in those $ 5 picture frames at wal mart.  this is it.  life is this shit pile but its my shit pile.

i've	atleast	i've been noticing that my alcohol intake is becoming more frequent.  my tolerance is increasing, but it's not uncommon for me to come into work hung over.  every afternoon, i go to the bar to drink for about 2 or 3 hours, only for me to go home and watch tv and drink some more until i have to go to bed for work.  i have gotten to the point where i get through a bottle of jim beam every 2 days.  i still manage to function, but i fear that my alcohol problem might become worse and consume me like i consume the bitter liquid, but its all i got, socially atleast
i	day!	i woke up today feeling angry.  angry at nothing and everything.  i know i need to meditate and chill out and prepare myself for a busy day. . . but i just want to sit here on reddit and figure out my brain.  i want to listen to music and to the birds. so lets all try to give ourselves a break when we start to feel upset, aggrivated and like you need to go run away/hide/jump out a window. breathe and remember that you are a strong, beautiful human being that can be happy. i have been trying to forgive myself as well as others today. i wish you all a peaceful day!

hi	loved.	hi all.  im sorry for reaching out in this group to ask for advice and insight when i know many others here are going through difficult times, but its so hard to watch your loved one struggle and feel so down due to depression and i know i may never understand, but i truly want to try to be there for him.  recently hes been really down, i havent seen him in about a week and a half, and our conversations have been limited to 1 to 2 messages a day. what are some comforting actions or words that anyone whos going through this wishes/experienced from their loved ones? im trying to find the balance between being there for him physically, verbally, but also giving him his space to process his thoughts.  i want to be there for him, but also not overwhelm him.  any advice would be greatly appreciated. and for everyone on this sub, i promise you, you guys are all loved.

hi	?	hi im new to this sub.  this is a question that has been haunting me for awhile.  approximately a year to be exact.  for starters, depression is not new to me, ive been dealing with for a decade now.  but ive never been depressed to the point i am right now. none of my hobbies seem to motivate me or whatever.  when i was younger i used to find comfort in said hobbies.  now not so much. i havent drawn in like 6 monthsdont play video games as much anymore.  even tho i bought a bunch of new games but i have no strength to play much less finish them. walking/jogging no energyreading havent read anything substantial besides the news or reddit posts. writing havent done that in a year or so. i dont know what to do anymore.  should i just punt my butt and go for it even if im gonna end up disappointed or what ?
i	help.	i always think of the past.  its painful but i cant stop myself.  i just cant seem to escape comparing now to then.  i remember the mistakes i made.  i remember all the friends ive lost.  i remember my childhood.  i remember the days when i didnt have depression.  i loved life.  i was living my life.  now, im inches away from killing myself.  id always wonder how my life became like this.  nostalgia makes me more miserable than i already am. does anyone else feel the same? how do you get through this? im having an episode again and it hurts.  please help. 
ready	ready.	ready to end my life.  ready to suicide.  years of chronic severe depression.  lying in my urine right now.  i am ready.  i am ready.  stonewalled.  i am isolated, and severely suicidal and depressed.  i am struggling.  i am ready to die.  i am being abused.  i am denied a voice.  i am ready to die.  i am ready. 
recently	loved	recently ive been feeling very down.  i know people around me love and care about me but i cant feel that love.  i feel down constantly and i just want someone to help me understand what im going through.  please tell me why i cant feel loved
im	here?	im in strange place in my life.  i realized that nobody can help me to overcome my mental problems.  and i cant help my loved ones with their problems.  i am black hole of pain and disapointment.  i dont want to kill myself, but i dont know how to live.  i feel hopeless without any person that could help me.  im no-one's favorite person, no-one's loved child.  why im still here?
schools online	have a few more choices	i'm depressed, in middle school, 13f. after  posting what to do on some different subs on reddit to get a verity of answers, i've decided to tell my  school counselor.   <e1> schools online </e1>  now so i  <e2> have a few more choices  </e2> and  don't have to tell in her person which is relief to my anxiety but, at  the same time not much of a different. if anyone could give me any incite or advice about how to tell my school counselor or which of these options sound best. i can email my school counselor through my student account or personal email. i can fill out a form for a check-in they call it. i could try to hint aggressively how depressed and anxiety ridden i am. i'd rather not call but, i could text her anonymously and tell her who i am once i trust her. 
scams family and friends for money	she doesnt have to get a job	we brought our adult 19yr old daughter up in a loving good home gave her everything.   since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she  <e1> scams family and friends for money </e1>  so  <e2> she doesnt have to get a job </e2> .  she rarely calls only if she wants something.  she never even contacts he brother or sister.  she is addicted to her phone.  when she lived at home if we took it off her at night she would be violent attack at us.  she quit uni.  she hangs out with negative people.  she always plays the victim mentality.   she recently told me her friend is a prostitute but swear mum im not. . i dont believe her she lies now.   i feel so sad.  i never thought she would grow to be this personality.  she was a beautiful child.  it makes me so depressed. 
today	arrived.	today i woke up with a black dog at the foot of my bed. its been a while since his last visit. he hung around as i got dressed for work,scrutinizing my every move. he jumped in the car and followed me to work. the radio failed to drown out the black dogs barks. were not allowed animals at work, but still here he sits. its been a while since his last visit and im certain it wont be his lasthopefully this time he runs away as quickly as he arrived. 
i	will.	i am 33m.  i've been dealing with depression and anxiety a long time, i talk to a counsellor, read the paperwork, focus on sleeping well and keeping on top of my trigger points. but, what do i do about plain old loneliness? weeks of isolation at a time really take their toll.  i know i'll always struggle with the usual self hate and anxiety, i will work to fight that.  but having nobody around is brutal.   i'm trying my best to take care of myself, but no matter what i do, i come home to a quiet empty house and end up pacing around talking to myself and things go downhill.  if i just had another person to give me a sliver of empathy, it would make it 1,000x easier.  what can i do when my depression feeds on that fact that there is no other voice besides my own? i am so tired of doing this alone.  i always thought i would eventually find a partner, but that hasn't happened and there is no reason to think it will. 
i	here	i just cant keep feeling like this.  i cant do it ive felt like this for almost a year now im a miserable failure i know people would miss me but i cant suffer anymore or stick around any longer i just feel too bad.  i cant stand myself i hate myself so fucking much i wish somebody else could of had my life where cant i kill my self i just cant keep posting here
build up my wardrobe	have stuff to pick from	i usually get it completely cleaned and and dusted but i never get it organized enough and i never find the perfect things online to buy to put in it.  i just want everything to be perfect you know i want everything to be there and enjoy it before i go.  im also trying to  <e1> build up my wardrobe </e1>  to  <e2> have stuff to pick from </e2>  on the big day.  as soon as i get a haircut shave and my acne clears up and my room is perfect ill do it.  i just wish it wouldnt make my mom sad
my	this?	my mind wants to tell one of my parents about my mental state, i have for a long time, but every fibre in my being is repelling that thought as far away as possible.  i know they would be accepting and loving and supportive, my mum at least, but i still can't.  i really thought about it today, instead of it lingering in my head, and i just can't.  there is something there, pushing me away as hard as it can, and it's winning.  i try to beat it most days, every single time i fail.  and as much as this subreddit can help, it hasn't helped me so far.  please stop giving empty afermations, they come from a good place but they really do not help.  how do i beat this?
see it get mentioned a lot	i want to ask here if anyone noticed improvements by exercising more	hey,like the title states, i am curious if anyone here has ever seen real progression regarding their mood and depression through exercise. i  <e1> see it get mentioned a lot </e1>  so  <e2> i want to ask here if anyone noticed improvements by exercising more </e2> . thanks :)
at	this.	at this point in my life i am seriously depressed and i feel like i'm in a hole i can't climb out of no matter what i do.  i can't remember anything that happens, i have no motivation to do even the things that i love doing, i can't focus, i can't bring myself to even properly take care of myself.  i'm not the type of person to have suicidal thoughts even when i am this depressed but i really need to find a way to continue.  i can't keep up in school and am 4 weeks behind on my work but i can't focus enough nor have the motivation and i also just can't remember enough to actually do the assignments.  my life is falling apart and my coping mechanism is to act like i'm perfectly fine so no one actually knows just how bad it is.  i need help even if it's just random people on reddit and idk if this is even the right place to post this.

ive	much.	ive been dealing with major depression since i was 13 and over the years its gotten worse. i was also in denial for a long time about how bad its been. ive done a lot of self work but it feels like it's never enough and maybe being a depressed person is just who i am and i can only change that so much. 
putting a real strain on my life	used to love going out	i'm taking ssris and vyvanse (for my adhd) and they help me function, but a big problem i'm still facing is the fact that i'm just so bored with life at the moment. i make music and that's cool, but i never go out, never want to do fun things with my partner, never want to do much of anything besides play video games and watch youtube while mindlessly scrolling. it's  <e1> putting a real strain on my life </e1>  because i  <e2> used to love going out </e2>  but i just feel so eh about everything now to the point that when i do make myself do things it feels like a chore. any advice you guys can give me? medication suggestions? things i can do myself?
ive	appreciated.	ive had biological depression since i was fifteen and lately theres very little i can do to keep myself motivated and avoid negative thoughts (the really negative kind). im on the highest dosage of wellbutrin and its just not doing enough for me.  i cant get out of bed easily, im not eating enough, and i get anxious typing an email. i need something to change and i have no idea what i need to do.  any advice appreciated. 
need supporting documentation and a note from a psychiatrist	change my grade from an f to a w	idk what to do.  i became wary about taking the meds and stopped going.  then i had a depressive episode and failed one of my classes.  i  <e1> need supporting documentation and a note from a psychiatrist </e1>  in order to  <e2> change my grade from an f to a w </e2> .  my appointment is in a few hours and idk how to bring this up. 
so	lives.	so my mother and sister tested positive for covid just now.  and i'm scared.  earlier i'd hear cases rising and people dying and it didn't really bother me much.  i knew it's a serious problem.  but that's all, i just knew.  i never realized the gravity of this pandemic till before it came to my doorsteps. i'm just an ordinary guy who cares for his family a lot.  i don't show it to them or anyone but i'm in my room scared out of my mind.  i can't concentrate on my studies and my college entrance exams are around the corner. so basically i just need to know that they're gonna be fine.  any advice, consolation, help right now would be much appreciated by methanks.  may you and your family be safe and live long happy lives. 
used to make me not want to kill myself	didnt want my mom to see me like that	theres tons of videos online of people committing suicide some worst than others.  they  <e1> used to make me not want to kill myself </e1>  because i  <e2> didnt want my mom to see me like that </e2>  but now whenever i see someones head flop open its gross and scary but i wish it was me.

attitude	there.	attitude is everything by portia nelsoni walk down the street.  there is a deep hole in the sidewalk.  i fall in.  i am lost. . . i am helpless.  it isn't my fault.  it takes forever to find a way out. i walk down the same street.  there is a deep hole in the sidewalk.  i pretend i don't see it.  i fall in again.  i can't believe i am in the same place.  bit it isn't my fault.  it still takes a long time to get out. i walk down the same street.  there is a deep hole in the sidewalk.  i see it is there. 
every	alive.	every time i set a day i dont have enough time to make everything perfect.  writing notes will probably take 2 days of crying through writing them and deep cleaning will probably take a whole day or 2.  and thats even if i can cut down my wrists after all that.  im so sick living even though my life is easy i dont have a job i barely do any chores i dont even do my schoolwork anymore i just sleep and lay around with my depression and plan to kill myself.  im just sick of staying alive. 
i	tia	i have taken snri (effexor) for the past 10+ years.   i am concerned about the long term effects and want to get off of it.  i know it is brutal to get off of, but im committed to making it happen.  i have done a lot of research on psilocybin (magic mushrooms) as a treatment for depression.  there is a lot of promising and positive data about studies that have been and are being done.    my questions are, 1.  any advice for getting off of effexor.   2.   has anyone had any experience with psilocybin?  if so, has it helped with your depression and/or anxiety?  3.   any experience with psilocybin as it relates to getting off is snris, will it help with the withdrawal symptoms?  tia

i	society.	i have submissive personality.  i can't say no to anyone even at my loss.  this prob is such that in the beginning of my college if anyone in the hostel asks me for help like fillilg water bottle, take food from mess,  etc.  then they began to ask me always.  i many times felt like servant inside but still tried many time to say no. . . . .  sometimes succeed but many times failed.  i am tired of all these traits like putting others before me,  low self esteem, many times i say something in a group people ignore me.  i can't represent myself in the group i can't have conversation while maintaining eye contact even with my best of friends.  i don't have my own opinion in almost everything i can't take stand of my own many times i don't have any idea how to react even on a normal conversation. this story is not about just college its from my school to my mba. i am just tired of all this and many more like this.  i cry alone in nights. i feel like a piece of shit in the society. 
my therapist cant see me	she can only see mild-moderate cases	sooooo i tried to yeet off the earth and went to the psych ward and now  <e1> my therapist cant see me </e1>  because  <e2> she can only see mild-moderate cases </e2> , and im moderate-severe. anyway, she was literally the best, most caring therapist that i actually connected to, that i have ever.  had.  i have had probably 15 therapists, (started in high school-now, and moving states) and she was hands down the best.  it was finally someone with experience and someone that wasnt fresh out of college or an intern or someone that just diagnosed and blamed my diagnoses for everything.  she was so beyond kind and caring. . . i am so soo sad and i just am wondering if someone else has had this sort of thing (losing a good therapist) happen and also had luck finding another one !i feel weird for being so sad.  (i cried. ) is that even a thing? i swear every other person i have wanted to leave! now im like nooooo.  idk. if you read this thanks ????

someti	bad	someti ames i just switch into a state of mind where i completely lose my shit and get physical in moments like that i have no empathy and there is almost nothing left of my personality i am just all in for violence and hurt and i do not care what it costs i say extremely mean things that leave people scarred and if that is not enough i just get physical the thing that makes me get physical the most is crying i hate crying when i am in an argument or in a fight and someone starts whining i just want them to shut the fuck up and i will make them it can switch like that within seconds one second i am all happy and in love with the entire world and it can all change within a single moment i do not wanna be like that but no matter how hard i try to avoid that behaviour, it will always happen again people never realise that my soul hurts from the constant anger after fights and arguments i tend to cut myself pretty bad
i	suggestions	i think i was doing it wrong like jumping from 100 to apathetic was kind of wack and i kind of realised i was still caring what ppl thought but i just wasnt conforming to it and i was just being negative and feeling like i didnt care even at ti ames itd make sense for me to care now i am trying to figure out how to balance not caring what ppl think of me yet still being caring and kind i think it was like dont care what ppl think, dont care about them sort of thing but i dont need to abandon empathy inorder to not people please anyone have any suggestions
tarted new meds	depressed	 <e1> tarted new meds </e1>  3 5 weeks ago and started to take a big decline and feeling  <e2> depressed </e2>  i screamed at myself in the shower and told myself how much of a mistake my parents made bringing me into the world on top of other really hateful comments felt almost cathartic but still cant help but feel like a useless sad sack of shit who cannot be happy and stable like everyone else fml
name isn t much better	uses a symptom to define the whole disorder	o it no secret that bpd is a super stigmatized and misunderstood disorder, and the name really doesn t help it has also been named emotionally unstable personality disorder eupd but i feel that that  <e1> name isn t much better </e1>  because it  <e2> uses a symptom to define the whole disorder </e2>  when there is much more to bpd than just being emotionally unstable if you could rename bpd, what would you call it i was wondering if anyone has thought of any names that could better encompass the wide range of symptoms characteristics better than borderline personality and emotionally unstable personality
suspect that i might have bpd	looking more and more into dbt	i have not been formally diagnosed, but i  <e1> suspect that i might have bpd </e1>  i have been  <e2> looking more and more into dbt </e2>  as a result and wanted to know if anyone had any solid resources they ve used in teaching themselves different aspects of dbt or any good ideas as to where how to start without a therapist open to books, apps, websites, worksheets, etc!
my	golden	my fp decided to cut off contact with me i am a mess, i would if i were hi am the meltdown is real this is the first ti ame i am out of bed since last wednesday i was spiraling and making it obvious on facebook so i deactivated i did not want to send walls of texts to hi am so i deleted his number and our text message thread i am really all happy about those choices now if i could stop i amagining what i would say to hi am if he called i would be golden
my	feelings	my ex broke up with me a few weeks back, and and she tried to hoover back, texting, calling faceti ame and reaching out to my brother things seems to have slowed down, but now i am struggling with coping with what happened she has bpd traits, but it feels like i am looking for an answer or closure that i will never find no matter what bpd or not we were toxic for one another, but i feel responsible or guilty in a sense not sure if what we experienced was love or just lust or a fog how do i move past all these feelings
i	future	i feel like i lost my chance a chance to have i ammature relationships in a good sense , relationships where we actually believed we d be together forever, where we could be angsty, edgy, clingy, needy, cringy; where we could be texting all day every day, make each other laugh or blush; a relationship where we could be awkward and make tons of mistakes but i am 24 now, almost 25 it all feels so dreadful, it feels like everyone is serious, like everyone is busy, like they don t have ti ame for your shit like texting and are way less understanding of mistakes everyone has their life in motion : kids, a house, cars, jobs; and i feel like i ve been stuck in the same place since high school i still feel like a teen but in a world of adults i am confused and scared of the future
drop the shame and believe in what i feel	pointless to put this on myself	would on t know if it s related to my bpd, afraid that expressing myself positively makes me completely functional or itll appear i am manipulative also associate it with being a weakling and i have to be cut edge at all ti ames want to  <e1> drop the shame and believe in what i feel </e1> , so  <e2> pointless to put this on myself </e2>  buti cant stop
terrified	share	terrified of the idea of group therapy - i ve never done it, and it s a fear of the group sessions that have stopped me from starting dbt therapy - but i d love to hear about others experiences in it - both before covid when it was all in person and during the pandemic online phone group sessions how much talking about your experiences in front of everyone are you expected to do is it triggering to hear everyone else s stories of hopelessness and abandonment and anger because i feel like it would be, so i am weary to try it i am still curious about the individual aspect of it - but especially concerned with the group aspect of it any and all experiences with dbt or group therapy in general please share
would	this	would oes anyone else watch a show and find themselves using the same lingo, mannerisms, same persona as one or multiple people in the show i feel like it partly has to do with the fact that i have no idea who i am and i am just an empty shell that latches on to the next new thing or i am just exaggerating and everyone does this
he feels extreme anxiety	he is unsure about his sexuality	o my friend who s a male, isn t sure about his sexuality long story short he ended up sleeping with another man and wasn t sure whether he liked it or not, it was weeks ago that it happened and we haven t talked about it since we talk on voice chat almost everyday while we play video games, at some point in the convo i asked hi am if he s certain about his sexuality now and it completely flipped hi am upside down when he had forgotten about it, i reminded hi am, without realising it was a sensitive topic for hi am, we ve always talked about it nonchalantly in the past and now  <e1> he feels extreme anxiety </e1>  that  <e2> he is unsure about his sexuality </e2>  again he s in this strange place of feeling like he has to redownload grindr but at the same ti ame has feels sick about the whole issue he ended up throwing up and having a mini panic attack i really couldn t say anything that would be helpful or that would calm hi am down i feel like i am just no good
rollercoaster	suicidal	just been on a hard  <e1> rollercoaster </e1>  tonight i was fine earlier and now i am feeling extremely  <e2> suicidal </e2>  hate this
scared	open up to them	i legiti amately hate my life i have worked so hard to become a better person it always feels like no matter how hard i have tried, it is never enough i hate my i ampulsive behaviors it is literally i ampossible for me to ignore my i ampulses i can not do it even though i want to i do not know what to do i hate social media so much i always am told to leave, but it is the only way i can make friends people in real life are really mean to me, and i am  <e1> scared </e1>  to  <e2> open up to them </e2>  i do not know what to to my head says i should take my life, and as days go by i listen to those things more and more i have thought about making plans about it, but i can not think of something that would be as quick and painless as using guns i am scared of guns so i just feel like i have wasted most of my ti ame after graduating 4 years ago just sitting around and being incapable of doing things my health has been very poor and is not getting much better i am not sure what to do
i	myself	i have had two therapists whic feels like a lot to me even though i know it s not i just moved and want to find someone else but i am really worried it won t be a good match again how many therapists is too many how do you weed out who will be a good fit without hurting their feelings i have the expectation that therapy should be life changing and help me but i don t know anymore i really believe i can get better are my expectations too high i am willing to do the work and am dying to, but my last therapist never asked questions and just gave me dbt worksheets that were helpful, but we didn t address any of my underlying issues at all i just felt ignored and it became about having an agenda for our sessions rather than me expressing myself
big sad	keep writing shit	i do not really know what else to say but i am pretty sure if you do not write enough on the posts in this subreddit, your posts get taken down - and that would be  <e1> big sad </e1>  so i am just gonna  <e2> keep writing shit </e2>  for the sake of it my partner asks me to tell hi am every ti ame sh or even want to self harm i obviously can not do that so i am just going to have to stop, and tbf i have but the reasons for wanting to do it have not gone away - in fact i think they ve gotten worse i am guessing that is enough words lol it still fucking hurts, so fucking much
hard	if i didn t get upset and have an emotional meltdown	i am fluctuating between feeling empty and numb to in so much pain i am pretty sure he broke up with me over text, which i haven t responded too, and said the relationship is not good for us and he would rather be friends i am trying to not hate and blame myself but it s so  <e1> hard </e1>  cause  <e2> if i didn t get upset and have an emotional meltdown </e2>  on my birthday at hi am a few days ago then maybe things would have been okay if i didn t go out with mutual friends last night after he said he was done with me maybe we would ve had a chance to fix stuff i am feeling so worthless right now that he won t even talk to me and choose to hurt me like this over text
how	own	how do you guys cope with dissociation, panic attacks, paranoid ideation, and suicidal thoughts i have no idea what to do i was hanging out with friends when all these things just took over me i do not have access to dbt there is not any neat where i live and anything i find online i would unaffordable i have dbt workbooks but it is not helping me doing it on my own
i	:	i almost forgot to post this after spending three months waiting to post it in hopes that it inspired other people to quit but today marks 2 whole years since i ve self - harmed! i never, ever envisioned going so long and i have to say it hasn t been easier, especially lately, but man i am so proud of myself it s still a struggle every day but every day it gets easier :
i feel like such a horrible person	not being eternally grateful	i mean yes, good things that you re grateful for don t mini amise the pain and suffering you do go through but for about almost 2 painful months i ve been crying and hoping that me and my fp would be close like we were before again it killed me every day i kept crying and i just couldn t function or be happy about any of my other friendships and now we re close like that again we re close again like i wanted to be, like i sobbed and wished we could be we talk a lot everyday but i can t even enjoy it when he says i love you, i don t even feel happy anymore its like, i can t be satisfied with anything i have, its never enough and i always want the next thing how am i supposed to cope if every situation inevitably brings me dissatisfaction and  <e1> i feel like such a horrible person </e1>  for  <e2> not being eternally grateful </e2>  for all the good things i have
o	know	o every ti ame i have a very negative experience that either causes me to split on someone or have a panic attack or just makes me feel hurt or angry, i just get this urge to pour my feelings out and talk to my therapist, but before i get to do that, all those feelings just fade away, like it never happened and whenever my therapist asks me about said event or how it made me feel, i literally cannot describe it, i just feel completely numb and indifferent about the experience, like it wasn t a big deal at all, even though i know that wasn t the case, and i have no recollection of my emotions this also causes me to forgive people very quickly : plz if anyone experiences something si amilar or knows why it happens, let me know
i don t spam people with messages	i know that s unfair on them	whenever i am talking to someone that i like it i can t help but to frequently check if they ve seen my message i ll spend what feels like an hour not checking, then i ll have a look at the ti ame and see that 15 minutes have passed  <e1> i don t spam people with messages </e1>  because  <e2> i know that s unfair on them </e2>  and makes me look desperate, but internally it does make me feel anxious waiting
she would throw me out	serial killers have that disease	my mother refuses to believe i am mentally ill i am not diagnosed i know i can t categorize myself the same the same way the diagnosed do but so many people around me agree if she would just agree i wouldn t be scared to have a diagnosis she says  <e1> she would throw me out </e1>  because  <e2> serial killers have that disease </e2>  i am not a bad personall i want is to make people happy i want everyone around me to be happy but it s i ampossible for me to not fuck up or split or anything i just want everyone to like me and love me but somehow i always end up alone i want to at least find out how to somehow manage this mind map i want her to know i am not a depressed teen i am broken beyond repair i just want people for once to see me as good
he was so understanding and thoughtful	want to cry	o as many of you guys know - when it comes to bpd we have moments where we lack empathy and or develop a god complex well this evening i was able to talk to hi am about it and he took it extremely well :  <e1> he was so understanding and thoughtful </e1>  it made me  <e2> want to cry </e2>  i had been having a week where i lacked empathy and emotion towards hi am among other things and he was just totally thoughtful and reassuring i seriously couldn t ask for a better fp and he makes me hopeful for my recovery :
excited	weekly therapy	things have been so gri am since covid started, all i have wanted to do is give back i tried political stuff and protests but where i live that can be met with armed militias, so i stepped away from that and just help by donating from afar now i have wanted to join casa for a while - they are advocates for displaced kids i had a really messed up childhood and feel like a orphan myself these days i am probably not having kids but always wanted them so it seems fitting i am quiet bpd so any kind of added stress i would take out on myself i think i am strong enough right now i have goals and a future i am  <e1> excited </e1>  about  <e2> weekly therapy </e2>  i am getting my shit together i still worry if i am strong enough for this any other bpd ppl do community work and face harsh realities doing it does it work how do you make it work
the	:	the past year has been hell on me and recently i ve realized that one of the things i really lacked was self love i never loved myself as much as i did other people in my life, had no boundaries at all, got used by people around me to a certain point and never realized it and now that everything in my life is at a low point ive started to notice these things and actively work on them ive gotten surprisingly good at saying no to people and standing my ground no matter how guilty i feel deep down but i am working on those thoughts with some things its like i know what the right thing to do is and i know what my boundaries are but i cannot i amplement them due to my obsessive thoughts and my fears most nights i feel completely empty and i feel like i have no real purpose or something that grounds me and it feels like the progress i have done hasnt really gotten me anywhere :
i always wanted i dread posting this	i m worried only two people or nobody replies	i want to and wanted to get better for such a long ti ame it seems i ampossible i think it is i ampossible, my bpd and mental health has just been worsening i feel like i cant get better so i want to get worse so that someone comes in and notices and saves me and i get the support and love and attention  <e1> i always wanted i dread posting this </e1>  because  <e2> i m worried only two people or nobody replies </e2>  again i relate to almost every post on this subreddit but i don t get the support and attention those people do so i si amultaneously get envious of them i hate this so much fuck
ever	weird	ever since i was a younger teenager i ve always had fantasies or daydreams about being rescued or saved someti ames after a fight with someone and i go on a walk and am crying, i pray someone will pull over and take me home, take care of me, save me from all my problems and we ll live happily ever after or if i am just walking alone at night and am feeling depressed or lonely, i ll fantasize about it it s usually an older person i want to save me, but maybe that s my daddy issues lmaoanybody else do this or am i weird
hi	am	hi everyone! i ve been in many abusive relationships and recently entered a 6 month relationship where the guy is really nice but not at all emotionally attentive he cares but can someti ames be insensitive it ends up with me on a fortnightly basis saying that i dislike the relationship while i think my reaction to things he does can be extreme i think i am tired of feeling like an evil gf for always bringing up problems and making hi am feel like he s never good enough fundamentally i think he is a good person but we aren t compatible been suggesting couples counselling but he wants to try hi amself so i think i am just going to break up with hi am now so what type of person is right for someone who struggles with bpd, ptsd and suicidal ideation any advice before i breakup with hi am
i don t want these feelings to be normal	if that s the case i wouldn t want to keep living	my friends mean well! i love them but lately i ve learned to stop talking about many things with them to them it s not as big of a deal but even a failed relationship to me causes suicidal thoughts they can t see i experience what they do at a higher intensity the worse is when i say something like my feelings are so intense that i have to do something destructive and i get that s normal everyone does that i find it so invalidating if it s so fucking normal then i could keep relationships i wouldn t think about suicide or the empty feelings i have i know its suppose to make me not feel guilty but in the end i find it triggering  <e1> i don t want these feelings to be normal </e1>  cause  <e2> if that s the case i wouldn t want to keep living </e2>  and i don t think they get that
outburst	not having sex in two weeks	i was thinking about some red flags from my relationship and wanted some feedback - constantly wanting my attention - talking to many guy friends - wanting me to meet her daughter after 2 - 3 weeks - hypersexual, wanting to have sex in public -  <e1> outburst </e1>  for  <e2> not having sex in two weeks </e2> , making me feel bad - constantly breaking up over small issues - me not making enough ti ame for her, s en though i saw her 2 - 3 ti ames a week - all her exes were toxic and she was the victi am - dui court case - no ambition or aspirations - idealizing me and devaluing me - trying to make me jealous of hot guys asking for her number - no real friends, many acquaintance - childhood and adult sexual trauma - not seeing a therapist - witholding sex for me to do things - constant validation making sure our relationship was fine
its	particular	its so weird bruh i be in love with someone and then i do not wanna see them, i do not wanna talk to them and i cant help but hurt them and make them confused i hate it what is your experience with this topic in particular
upsetting to know it will eventually end	always does someti ames i do excellent	one week i go to therapy and my therapist congratulates me for doing well and i amproving, i get better at understanding people and being empathetic so i do not start fights, i am happy most of the ti ame, i do not self - harm or do drugs to cope, my relationship with my boyfriend seems perfect, but the next week something triggers me and i find myself again attempting suicide, wanting to break up with hi am, making threats, having multiple mood swings every day, and the next week the cycle starts again i never know for how long my stability will last and it is  <e1> upsetting to know it will eventually end </e1> , because it  <e2> always does someti ames i do excellent </e2> , therapy and medication seem to work, everyone congratulates me for getting better, but then i disappoint them again i know learning to live with bpd is not supposed to be a linear i amprovement, but this is ridiculous
all	yourself	all my friends and family who suffer from bpd, myself included, have 0 maybe even negative levels of self worth i have yet to meet someone or encounter someone online with bpd who truly loves themselves is it ever possible for us to everyone always tells me i can t heal my ptsd and bpd if i don t love myself but i feel that saying that is like telling a depressed person to just be happy do you love yourself
was	me!	was diagnosed with bpd at 17, i am 37 now i have just begun therapies and such mostly just happy to be somewhere i am not going to be equated to someone who is abusive thanks for seeing me!
i	together	i am so lost and confused i do not know what is real anymore these emotions are so overwhelming, the anger and jealousy and frustration, nothing compared to the depth of sorrow and loneliness and at the same ti ame, i just want to see hi am, to talk to hi am, to feel hi am next to me again i do not understand any of it, i need to know why, i need something, a reason or excuse, i do not even care if it is complete bullshit, i just need hi am to acknowledge that my pain is real, i will lose my mind if i do not get something, i do not know what else to do how can i get thru this on my own not just without hi am, i do not have anyone else how do i put myself back together
feel like he hates me or he just talks to me	he feels sorry for me	my question is : how do you people deal with people who are not emotional and extremely direct i am around this guy who is very eccentric in kind of awkward which i can relate to 100 when it comes to emotions i don t think understand hi am i am sure he has emotions, but he never shows them his one emotion is sarcasm he doesn t talk much but when we do talk it s a good conversation we do get along and have si amilar views on the world and si amilar interest there s never small talk he doesn t ask me how i am doing or anything,he just jumps into a conversation he s also really smart but condescending people told me not to take it personally, that s just his personality but i just always  <e1> feel like he hates me or he just talks to me </e1>  because  <e2> he feels sorry for me </e2>  so does anyone else have a hard ti ame with the right people who have a very stern tone to their voice
so	this	so why am i still scared why am i still stuck with this fear of i ampending doom i turned 20 a few months ago and i started my first year at university studying mental health, i got a job at an amazing nonprofit medical organization with benefits and great coworkers, i am in an intensive dbt program where i amprovement is being made and i am a 5 hour drive away from my abusive and toxic family however, i am so scared whenever things go well for me, it is a fluke it gets ripped away from me and i get bullied either by myself or other people that good things are not supposed to happen to me and i am supposed to be miserable forever this sucks, dude i hate this
si	of	si ample question what triggers your abandonment fears what makes you fear your fp is going to leave for me, here are just a few unanswered texts calls for greater than 30ish min usually only affected when i do not have something else distracting me angry upset distressed tone of voice often fixed by calming tone of voice words of affirmation reassurance when your fp hangs out with someone other than you without you, even if its family or close friends i have been able to be really self aware of this one and manage it internally for the most part, surprisingly but its still a trigger having disagreements arguments different opinions than your fp these are just a few of mine i really would like to hear some of yours, maybe i will find some things i didnt even think of

i can t talk to people	if your baby died, i am going to say something inappropriate	i get this mood where everything is hilarious to me  <e1> i can t talk to people </e1>  on it because  <e2> if your baby died, i am going to say something inappropriate </e2>  and laugh i m serious guys, this is i amportant i even have a psychiatrist tell me this but she called it makes inappropriate jokes that are incongruous to the context i am in same mood right now and feeling excited as though my brain only has shouty caps i made jokes to my mom at my grandmother wake she was dying wtf my mom was so mad so i went outside and made snow angels like a demented lunatic while my mom was crying and they were wheeling the body out in a cardboard box to go to the crematorium i think i said i wonder if i can order one of those dead people on amazon, which was hilarious to me i wonder if people think i am on drugs someti ames someone mad af with me at the moment ahhhhhhh! what the heck is this mood
hello	tips	hello all, i want to start journaling but do not really even know where to begin when i open my journal i just feel overwhelmed or someti ames i just forget everything completely and become empty and have nothing to write does anyone have any journaling tips
idk	back	idk why it took so long to dawn on me but i always thought antidepressants were supposed to marginally help but would never be able to get close to completely getting rid of depression but then i heard from some people that their meds made them feel not depressed and i was like what that is possible i have gone through courses and combinations of most ssris available and some snris before i quit taking meds and noticed no actual change when i quit, whereas people have told me that they dont feel depressed when they take antidepressants and they feel an actual difference when they are not able to take them not to be a dick but it makes me feel bitter in a way that nothing works for me but some people can feel better just by popping a zoloft every day sidenote : at this point i have no plans on going back to a psychiatrist for reasons i do not feel the need to share, please respect this and dont try and pressure me into going back
my	bpd	my journey has lead me from ocd to autism to codependency and now bpd therapy is always helpful but it is one hour a week and that is not enough to stay grounded and keep making progress for me i have found youtube videos to be i ammensely helpful so i am wondering if anyone can recommend any good channels that deal with coping and healing from bpd
hi	helpful	hi everyone, i have severe bpd and i was wondering what medications work for you i am on a heavy dosage of lamictal and effexor they have helped been on since january however i still feel awful i spiral frequently and i am in so much pain when i do i am still very depressed and my emotions have not calmed down yes i use just about every coping skill i ve learned they do help overall, but i just don t think i should still be suffering as much as i do so i wanted to see if anyone has found a good medical chemistry that works for them i thought maybe i just wasn t being tough enough, but i truly am still suffering i shouldn t feel this terrible when i am taking hundreds of milligrams of medications a day or is this my new normal they are working and i need to put in more work on my side i don t know, any advice would be super helpful
experts	me	experts all say do not worry, do not panic, but stay alert informed wash your hands, do not touch your face, and avoid large crowds i do not know who might need this, but it is one of my favorite dbt coping skills for emotion regulation i have noticed some people mentioning their anxiety that they are worried people hoarding masks that vulnerable people need let remain alert informed but let us please remain mindful rational in our behavior i am here if anyone needs to talk envelope please, not dm and i will be working on off today so if i do not repond fast, please bare with me
i	regulatteeeeeee	i feel like my whole body is overrun by the energy that surges out of whatever experience just happened negative, positive, apathy like i have two halves of me and in one hand i am fully conscious of what a fool i am being but at the same ti ame i am so fueled by the emotions that it s just a vicious degrading cycle of painful experiences the biggest step i ve taken in the last year is to identify and actually own up to the things i did instead of deflecting onto everyone but i fee like it just makes me hate myself more and feel bad for everyone in my life i need to figure out how to regulatteeeeeee
i try not to correlate the two topics too much with each other	one is an actual mental disorder	i am a cancer water sign , and i feel like a large part of the cancer traits enable more bpd type symptoms  <e1> i try not to correlate the two topics too much with each other </e1>  since  <e2> one is an actual mental disorder </e2>  and the other is just a speculation based on my birth date i am an aries rising and libra moon if anyone s curious

it will be for supporting eachother	a little awkward and dough	hi, i am nathan i am just a pretty cool 21 year old guy who is recovering from bpd developmental trauma cptsd i have made a lot of progress, but still cannot fully function, so to finish the job i am working on a neurofeedback program that would be able to help me and hopefully others as well my interests outside of that are meditating, being active, reading, psychology, and certain smartypants things like math and neuroscience i am looking for someone who would like to connect for up to a couple hours each day and give eachother that human connection, support, and warmth since  <e1> it will be for supporting eachother </e1> , it might be  <e2> a little awkward and dough </e2>  - ey at first, but we very well may end up being good friends!message me or leave a comment if interested! of course, anyone else who visits this thread can message anyone else in the comments section if they want
he	connected	he talked so much about her exes that i feel like we would be really good friends if we met she practically dates the same person in different bodies down to the left handedness, movies, interests and type and breaks up with them when they look like they carry the weight of the world and have no confidence still no dots connected
he	be	he texted that she want to talk about what we want in the relationship, then said that she wants happiness this was my reply not that i think she will understand, but it felt good to say you want me to need you as much as you need me you feel empty, lost and scared and don t know who you are you want me to be strong and successful so that i can take care of you, but you also want me to be just as depressed and anxious and empty as you so that i will need you like you need me you want me to take care of you like a parent, but you also want me to be dependent on you like a child i cannot be both your parent and your child, and it is not a healthy relationship for me to be either i can t give you happiness the only way you will be happy is if you face the emptiness inside of you, and figure out who you are without anyone else if there was nobody else in the world, who would you be

i	documentary	i just had about 2 months experience with a bpd relationship and think i ve come more obsessed by the crazyness talked about and the fact it really an unknown to so many people than the idea that i am going through the 1st discard cycle if she cycles may be gone forever she was open about her bpd so i looked into it pretty early and now just sitting back on the crazy train hopefully to jump off soon if she discard i might have to lolanyways it make a hell of a netflix doc on bpd and non bpd relationships i think i might start that process soon as a lover of films documentary
anyone	fleas	anyone here had this yet when it all finally hits you and instead of making you sad like every other day you just get angry i was enraged tonight thinking about the manipulation, about my own past, about her games and tricks, how many bad things have happened to me in life for trying to help others, or trying to do the right thing i hated all human beings i had revenge fantasies i i amagined just shitting on every person that s hurt me, all because i let a mentally disordered person into my life, and they hurt me i hated my parents bpd mother bipolar father for raising me in a hell that led me here i hated anyone in traffic who was going faster than me, anyone that tried to pass me i hated the car in the parking lot next to me playing their shitty music i hated the whole world, i am still coming down from the mental trip, but it was like i split the universe black fleas

she raged at me, said i have no empathy and stuff	i did not answer	she always brought up things from 2 months ago, i did not even knew and then said i hurt her there and then i was just so confused she brought up every little mistake of mine and i had the feeling that i had to be perfect when something happened that made her upset i had to apologize for everything and she did not even think about apologizing even after arguments i iniiated where i felt something is different she raged at me for asking her about it it just feels so weird, is it me or does it feels they have no healthy way of communicating when she was hurt found it out in the aftermath ,  <e1> she raged at me, said i have no empathy and stuff </e1> , just because  <e2> i did not answer </e2>  for 4!! hours even when i write this down i feel hilarious
my	this	my wife has been away for a couple months now, crazy it is only been 2, it is not been complete no contact but very li amited curious if my best way to go about this is to reach out to her every so often, kinda remind her i am still thinking of her and that she loved, everything is okay or if i am better off playing along to the silent treatment and readying my mind for when she does return i am just just struggling and unsure how to play this
i	you	i feel like over ti ame they just tear and tear you down , projecting their insecurities on to you, feeling responsible for their over the top reactions, walking on egg shells without even realizing it you end up getting depressed but addicted to the ups love bombs and ulti amately they just suck your life force out of you
she was upset that i would do	she cares about me	blocked removed her social media i got myself angry last night realising what a fool i have been played for and just like that, i took that step it was hard, scary and honestly pretty upsetting but this had to be done the stalking was getting to me, she left me on read but was happy to watch my socials i decided i had enough of her games i do not know i am going to manage in the days to come but i am glad i have taken this step to remove her she made threats to cut me off block me in the past, when i called her bluff and done it myself  <e1> she was upset that i would do </e1>  that because  <e2> she cares about me </e2>  i can not allow myself to believe her lies anymore, be played by her and be taken advantage of
i	years	i left my favorite bikini at his place and i saw pictures of another woman wearing it this woman he clai ams i shouldn t be worried about but it s no secret that they ve been having sex, and to be frank he looks incredible happy with her i grew upset about the bikini and called hi am he wanted me to visit hi am next weekend - clai aming that he loves me - and here i am seeing my thong bikini in another woman s butt crack with her vagina juices rubbing on it i felt incredibly disrespected we re thousands of miles away and he does whatever he wants, except now it s my clothes being paraded in by another woman as if they don t belong to anyone, and he lies telling me he doesn t like so - and - so we ve been on and off for a couple of years
this	person	this may sound a little confusing but i hope you can follow when your pwbpd tells a story involving friends, family, co - workers, etc, do they assign the other person an annoyingly petty or aggressive voice - when talking about what a person has said to them my pwbpd does this all the ti ame - even when describing an interaction with a person she likes or admires but it comes off like she hates the person or thinks less of them - by the tone or voice she attributes to the person
there	me	there is something that happened during the ti ame we dated that still doesnt sit right with me it was a conversation we had shortly before having sex this was a short lived relationship thankfully and this was the first and only ti ame we had sex although she wanted to stay fwbs after the breakup i am going nc though she would talk about other guys constantly throughout this red flag i ignored well one day she casually mentioned she was looking into moving in with this guy who before i didnt need to worry about we had casually talked about living together before although now i am realizing maybe she was more serious than i thought another obvious red flag i ignored she started talking about this 1 month into the relationship anyway literally 5 mins after that conversation about the other guy, she leads me to the bedroom, lays down and begs me to fuck her maybe it was a coincidence she would talk about exes and other guys a lot but the ti aming is really strange to me maybe i am overthinking it but it doesnt sit well with me

One	says.	One thing I’m starting to learn is that google is useless for finding out what’s wrong with you.  I have diagnosed myself with heart disease, heart arrhythmia, peripheral artery disease, MS, neuropathy, testicular cancer, bowel cancer, thoracic outlet syndrome and diabetes.  Unsurprisingly I’ve been completely wrong every single time I’ve went to the gp.  So if your worried something’s wrong with you check it out with your gp and don’t get worried with what google says. 
I'm not the only one with extreme health anxiety	happy	I am so  <e2> happy </e2>  that  <e1> I'm not the only one with extreme health anxiety </e1> .  I have sank to my lowest because of this awful thing our brains do to us.  It is almost unbearable.  It got to the point where living seemed like such a JOB and a pain.  I have had 30+ office visits this year and plenty of ER/Urgent Care visits, and I'm telling you, NO ONE (not even a doctor) could tell me I wasn't dying.  No one could tell me I didn't have cancer, didn't have a blood clot, a brain tumor, etc. I was never like this.  I can actually pinpoint the tipping moments that created this anxiety.  Things are better now. The stress that health anxiety brings is unlike anything I've ever experienced and to know that there are others like you guys that feel what I feel is reassuring and is like a light at the end of the tunnel. Remember to stay away from Google :)thank you all
All of your supportive messages to each other	helped me calm down	I just wanted to say thank you to everyone in this sub.  I’m relatively new to reddit and idk where I’d be without y’all.  Simply being able to read about all of your experiences, relate to them and know that I’m not alone has been incredible for my mental health.   <e1> All of your supportive messages to each other </e1> , while not directed at me, have  <e2> helped me calm down </e2>  while experiencing the same issues as the poster.  Since I’ve been here, I’ve noticed my health anxiety decrease.  While it of course isn’t gone completely, and the rona remains an active alarm in my mind, (ugh! With all the new stuff coming out about it too.  Can’t catch a break) y’all have been a life saver.  Thank youIf any of you are having an episode and need help being talked down or talked to by someone who understands, I’m here
moving into our first home in 2 weeks	good and exciting	So me and my partner are  <e1> moving into our first home in 2 weeks </e1> , this should be a  <e2> good and exciting </e2>  event.  It is! But I just can’t help this feeling of dread :( I keep having intrusive thoughts like “what if I get sick and can’t support us” or “just when things are going well something bad is going to happen” and it’s honestly so unfair that I can’t give this my full attention and enjoy it like it should be enjoyed.  It’s a big step and the beginning of a new chapter and I’m ruining it with my stupid damn mind! I constantly think everything’s gonna be taken from me in a some kind of sad sick twist of fate when I should be getting my shit together for the move and working out my finances etcI’m having my first long awaited counselling session next week so hopefully that will help.  I’m so fed up with myself I just want to feel normal again. Can anyone relate?
I’m	post.	I’m so proud of myself! I needed to share my achievement with somebody but my friends and family just wouldn’t understand what a big deal this is.  So i thought I would share it with you guys!That’s it.  That’s the post. 
saying it out loud	sends me into full panic	I am trying so hard right now to not google my current symptoms.  I’m not even going to say what I think I have cause  <e1> saying it out loud </e1>  just  <e2> sends me into full panic </e2>  (not the virus that is currently a pandemic).  I’m just terrified that this is the time I don’t google or I don’t rush to the ER and I’m supposed to.  And I ignore these symptoms cause I’m the girl who cried wolf and I don’t make it. I haven’t googled symptoms in 24 hours now.  It’s such a small step and I’m afraid I’ll break it.  I’m just waiting till 9am (2:30am) right now to go to the pharmacy to get meds.  I’m just venting to stop myself from googling or going to the ER. . . thanks for listening
At	body.	At least once a day if not many times I just think about my heart beating in my chest and it freaks me out.  Like why doesnt it stop, how does it just keep going and going? I feel like any minute it will stop or something.   I think about my other organs too and all the microscopic things going on in my body and that's what scares me.  The fact that I have no idea what is really going on in there and I cant control it.  I hate being afraid of my own body. 
cold water and ice	normalize my heart rate after an attack	In the shower this morning and I feel the WOOSH in my chest and neck and my heart starts racing uncontrollably. Been a while since this has happened.  I know I’m not dying, but it’s impossible to get used to. Luckily  <e1> cold water and ice </e1>  help  <e2> normalize my heart rate after an attack </e2> . Just venting.  Happy Sunday everyone. 
I	:)	I currently have a health concern that has been bothering me for a few days - my logical brain says I'm fine, my anxiety brain says I'm dying.   Instead of rushing to urgent care to have them tell me that it's probably nothing and I should keep an eye on it, I actually booked myself some appointments for CBT therapy!  If my problem gets worse I will go see a doc, but I feel like this is a step in the right direction for me, and I'm really hopeful that something can help pull me out of these spirals :)
So	:)	So I’ve obsessed over pretty much every area of my body and diagnosed myself with 100 serious illnesses (mostly a few months ago when it got really bad, it’s better now). One of the things I was worried about was the classic: my heart.  I’d plead to be taken to the ER every time I got some chest muscle ache from working out or poor posture, fearing a heart attack.  Well, last weekend I got the feeling, had the thought, brushed it aside and went on a hike.  My heart did perfectly well and I’m proud of myself :)
can’t stop thinking about it	affects my daily life and sleep	I’m 18 and I’m so certain I have a brain aneurysm or something , deep down I know I don’t since the odds are so incredibly low , but I just  <e1> can’t stop thinking about it </e1>  , it  <e2> affects my daily life and sleep </e2>  .  I’m constantly in a state of panic and stress , I get headaches , my head feels heavy , and some random dizziness, my neck hurts from stress and I Just can’t get over it ( I also have derealisation)
I thought a bump below my knee was a tumor.	hyperventilated and cried all the way to the E. R	I once  <e2> hyperventilated and cried all the way to the E. R </e2>  because  <e1> I thought a bump below my knee was a tumor.  </e1>  Didn’t realize I had the same bump below my other knee.  Doctor confirmed it was just a bone.  They were really kind and understanding.  They gave me Ativan to calm down, some water and heated blankets but man, I still felt so crazy after the whole ordeal.  Fuck HA
After	ERP!	After two weeks, it's safe to say my health anxiety has dropped from a constant 8-10 down to a 0-1.  It is simply amazing that I am fortunate enough to feel like a real person again. The key? ERP therapy.  I've been seeing a therapist who specializes in OCD instead of general anxiety.  It has made ALL of the difference.  Even though I feel normal again, I am going to continue with the therapy for as long as she recommends so that I know how to manage it when and if it returns (which it probably will!)In addition, I have stopped Googling symptoms altogether for the last 9 days (which also has included visiting this subreddit), and have been making an effort to get out, socialize, and do things to get my brain away from the ruminating thoughts. Please do yourself a favor and find a therapist that specializes in ERP!
So	myself.	So I’m looking down on my phone which is resting on a pillow, and I keep seeing a like. . . . flash? Of something in the left eye (which has had a persistent twitch).  So I keep looking at phone and I keep noticing it and I feel the anxiety rise up about to turn into a full panic attack.  I look closer at the pillow.  There are specks of glitter on it.  The glitter was catching the light.  Lmao, I can’t even with myself. 
Every moment I worry if I will suddenly die of a ruptured aneurysm	afraid to go asleep	*** TRIGGER WARNING ***A week ago Grant Imahara passes away of a brain aneurysm, and ever since I thought about how scary that is I've felt a headache 24/7.  This is not nothing, I actually can feel my head throb and ache, the product of me wanting that specifically to NOT happen; a cruel joke of anatomy that we can create physical pain and misery for days and days out of nothing but a single thought.   <e1> Every moment I worry if I will suddenly die of a ruptured aneurysm </e1>  and every night I'm  <e2> afraid to go asleep </e2> ; the moment I begin to drift off, my brain pulls me back and says wake up, you're dying RIGHT NOW! Just so so exhausted. 
Remember	yourself	Remember that ALL professionals agree that the best medical treatment is preventative treatment (meaning, taking precautions to avoid the spread or worsening of an illness rather than just treating it)Public closures aren’t happening because they think everyone will drop from this virus.  They’re happening to lessen the spread to avoid doctors and hospitals being overwhelmed.  This is a very good thing! It’s a perfect example of preventative measures.  take a deep breath and be proud of yourself
my worst panic attacks come at night.	terrified of going to sleep	I’m  <e2> terrified of going to sleep </e2>  because  <e1> my worst panic attacks come at night.  </e1>  Ill wake up feeling panicked and have to taken myself down because my heart will be going like 180 BPM and I feel like I’m dying. What if I actually am? It’s terrifying and I hate this and I just want my life back.  I’m scared that one time it’s gonna be serious and I’ll just think it’s another panic attackEDIT: All your responses have been so nice and helpful, it’s comforting knowing I’m not alone but also sad that so many of us go through this.  Wishing you all the very best
I'm	sick?	I'm in the middle of a rabies anxiety scare right now and I cannot calm myself down.  It all started with me SOMEHOW convincing myself that a scrape on my ankle was caused an walking past an unconscious bat on my front porch and now three weeks later I'm feeling symptoms that feel very real?? Like my right foot and toes have been tingling for four days and yesterday I was almost in hysterics because I was convinced my throat was closing and I kept drinking water to prove to myself I wasn't becoming hydrophobic. .  along with seeing hallucinations out of the corner of my eye (anxiety eye tricks), muscle spasms which only appeared when I thought about them, muscle aches and pains from constantly being tense, etc.  The general scaremongering about rabies and constantly seeing YOU WILL DIE A PAINFUL DEATH under every search result has left me ruined.  Have any of you guys literally thought yourself sick?
dealing with anxiety daily	fucking disheartening	Does anyone else get super frustrated  <e1> dealing with anxiety daily </e1> ?  Like out of nowhere having a brain zap and then that cascade of sadness/panic/worry that something is going to happen to you?  15 years dealing with this and it’s so  <e2> fucking disheartening </e2>  sometimes :(. 
I	food?	I was really excited to try this new tea that had chicory in it but since I’ve never had chicory I had one sip and then freaked out that I’m going to have some terrible allergic reaction.  Anyone else? How do you deal? Should I push through and have the food?
I	ourselves.	I am currently in therapy for anxiety, burn out, perfectionism issues and a past traumatic event.  These last 6 months or so have been some of the hardest of my life, feeling worthless, experiencing a lot of self doubt and a lot of negative self talk. I have a long term common law spouse who I live with.  He is dealing with low self esteem, anxiety and grief for a parent who passed away a few months before covid started. About my issues my therapist keeps saying I should talk to my partner more about what my needs are and how he can help me through this time.  But he’s dealing with so much of his own issues that he just takes his frustration out on me or at least doesn’t have the mental capacity right now to help me.  How on earth am I supposed to balance the two?TLDR: Spouse and I both have issues - how are we supposed to be there for each other right now when we barely have the mental capacity to look after ourselves. 
wanted to help the guy	got him some water	Today when I went to the shop and spotted a homeless man who asked if I had spare change on me but unfortunately I didn’t but I still  <e1> wanted to help the guy </e1>  so I went in a  <e2> got him some water </e2>  and I never felt so proud of myself. 
During my depressive episodes	get awful anxiety and paranoia.	I was just diagnosed with bipolar 2, and got put on lamictal. I am curious though, does lamictal help with anxiety? <e1> During my depressive episodes </e1>  I  <e2> get awful anxiety and paranoia.  </e2>  I’m really hoping it may help with this. 
a call/text	make someone’s day just a bit better	Good morning and happy Thursday my wonderful friends! It’s almost Friday so hang in there we’re almost there! You are very loved, appreciated and cherished.  Please send me any prayer requests if you need anything! Be a joy and encouragement to others around you today, just  <e1> a call/text </e1>  can really  <e2> make someone’s day just a bit better </e2> !“Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

I	people.	I got first short covid vaccine today.  Lately I'm not feeling great and I wanted to take a break. My manager won't let me take leave, I still somehow convinced him. He said , why can't you work for half day as shot takes just 30 mins.  But I took a complete day off now thinking this gives me anxiety.  What if he starts targeting me more that I opposed him. I'm so facked in my life now.  This stupid manager is making my life like a living hell. I never once in these 5 months, happily went to work.  I always get anxiety before I open my laptop ( Work from home). I can't imagine going to office and facing these people. 
throwing up	ruining my life	Before reading, please note that my biggest fear in life is  <e1> throwing up </e1> !! I don't know how that came to be, but it really is  <e2> ruining my life </e2> .  Anyways, I got my first dose of Moderna today and I have been unbelievably anxious since.  I asked other people if they have ever vomited because of it, and they said yes.  I can't stop obsessing over it.  I'm exhausted but refuse to sleep and I refuse to eat.  I can't calm myself down and I've had 2 anxiety attacks today.  I can feel my third one coming on, and man, I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack or something.  Please tell me if I'll be okay? Or give me some words of advice. . .  I've been drinking water and tiny sips of Gatorade throughout the day. 
Hello	die	Hello everyone I'm panicking about my health because last night I was seating eating dinner  suddenly my breathing is weird I forgetting to breathe or something I don't have cough fever when i breathe through  my nose it is clogged a little and I'm not wheezing or something or coughing blood it just happened suddenly  and I googled it of course and it said that I have water on my lungs and heart failure  and I read the symptoms of both of the diseases symptoms can breathe when lying flat.  And I said to my self.  OK DON'T PANIC YOUR STILL YOUNG YOUR A TEENAGER YOU DON'T HAVE LUNG CANCER OR ANYTHING. After that I lie down to sleep after I lie down I'm forgetting to breathe to now I started panicking because the symptoms I saw on Google this is the stressful night of my life then the panic attack came through and my breathing suddenly get worse I don't know what to do I really thought I'm going to die
How	it?	How do you deal with rumination? I often find myself thinking about everything I’ve done wrong and obsessing.  It’s like my brain loves to point out those times I’ve messed up and embarrassed myself.  Then I go into a deep hole of this and caring about what others must think of me etc! And each night I scrutinize everything I said during that day to anyone, and my brain tries to find a flaw (example, maybe I said the wrong thing and offended someone etc).  Does anyone else do this? What helps to stop it?
I’ve	issue?	I’ve recently moved completely far away and my social anxiety has gotten the best of me.  It took me four months to even walk into the gym here but today I finally did it, albeit for 30 minutes but it’s a start.  I don’t even know why I have anxiety over it, maybe that people will make fun of me? Im usually an outgoing person but certain circumstances make me very uncomfortable, like the gym.  Anyone else have this issue?
TW	advice?	TW passive suicidal thoughtsI have suffered from anxiety for about 7 years and suicidal thoughts for 4 years.  Whenever I experience anxiety or want to tell my mom something I write it down on a sticky note and she reads it later.  The past 2 sticky notes stated how I wanted to kill myself (these are passive thoughts that occur frequently when I feel guilty for having emotions.  I do not and will not act upon these thoughts I just wonder what would happen if I did leave this world) after I stated that, my mom completely looked over it and never talked to me about it.  I’m sure she just doesn’t want to try to deal with that but a part of me thinks she doesn’t care about me feeling suicidal even though she knows I’ve harmed twice and attempted once.  I’m not sure what to do or if I should talk to her about it.  Any advice?
going out to public places	super overwhelming for me	i think this would be the best place to look for some tips, so i hope someone can help! so,  <e1> going out to public places </e1>  (i. e.  target ?) can be  <e2> super overwhelming for me </e2> .  I get feel hot from the inside out and bc the actual store isn’t warm my sweat ends up feeling cold and gross and obviously that isn’t a pleasant feeling.  my coping mechanism has been playing around with my hands and fingers over and over and over again and its very obvious and it stresses me out even more. does anyone have any little tools/toys(?) that are small and can easily go unnoticed that might be able to give my hands something to do instead?Thanks in advance.  Much appreciated :)
I	please.	I just wanna know if these physical things are related to anxiety or maybe something is just really wrong with me.  Anybody else feeling the following: shaking in legs, cold hands and feet, feeling like electricity rushing in arms and legs, tension in back and neck, somewhat like a lump in throat that makes it hard to swallow, tense, feeling unsafe, fight/flight heightened, dizziness, tightness in chest, ringing in earsI just wanna know if i’m not the only one who feel these symptoms and if so, what do you do to cope?? Help please. 
For	yoga.	For a long time I thought I could just manage my anxiety without medication.  Then I tried Lexapro Zoloft and a few others.  At the highest doses and they didn’t seem to help.  I take a very low dose of Xanax twice a day.  But I’d like something to be actively helping me aside from that.  Anything helped most for you that’s not an SSRI or benzo? Yes I meditate; do therapy, read; and yoga. 
I	myself?	I suddenly become scared of walking on a manhole cover and really anxious about my door lock  ( which is a key pad  ) sequrity, so I rub it really hard before I get inside my house.  And I even find myself today locking the door to my room. I’m living alone and it could be a natural thing to do, but I’m worried because I’ve never done it or felt that I should beware like this before.  And all of those started so fast and unexpectedly to me.  It’s not like I’ve heard something bad happen in the neighbours, rather it’s quite safe around here. Do I have to worried about myself?
it	bit	it started out as a sharp pain and went away after some deep breaths, but now mild squeezing pain keeps coming and going in waves over the past few days. . .  heart problems run in my family and its all ive been able to think about.  i have a doctor appointment tomorrow, but im recovering from agoraphobia so going places freaks me out really badly too ): in my heart i know its just anxiety, but i feel like i just need that reassurance from my doctor.  im also very young and the possibility of it being something worse is slim.  im just so afraid of being rushed to the ER or something. . .  anyway, does this happen to anybody else?? knowing im not the only once might help a bit
cats can have rabies	scared of them	So I live in an apartment where severa feral cats live.  I read that  <e1> cats can have rabies </e1>  and now I am  <e2> scared of them </e2> .  I get my groceries delivered to my door and I leave instructions to hand them to me and not to put them in the floor.  Well, today I had a delivery that came earlier than expected.  When I opened the door, the guy already had placed the bags on the floor.  I’m worried if we can catch rabies by eating the groceries that were in the bags left on the floor. 
A	days.	A few times these weird episodes will happen to me.  I will get the feeling like I'm going to pass out, my eyes can't  focus , and my right arm with tremor uncontrollably.  I am conscious and aware, usually I can speak but can only say certain things or repeated words and my voice is often shaky, and I'm out of breath.  This only lasts up to 5 minutes.  Afterwards I feel like crap for the next few days. 
For	appreciated!	For the last half a year, I’ve been having trouble relaxing.  I would take a break to do yoga, or cook, or watch a video, but I feel like there’s a string inside my head that’s always tense.  I keep thinking what I need to do next, from everyday tasks to scenarios a few years down the line.  I feel like if I ever relax and truly relax, I’ll be caught off guard by something bad.  There’s a few stressors: I’m moving out to live on my own soon.  The industry i work in is expecting to become a lot worse.  I just started a new job and I’m worried that people are perceiving me as not as good as others.  Also just the bad economy + inflation, and the isolation due to the pandemic in general.  Any help is appreciated!
my anxiety	don’t believe in myself	help a girl out.  going to the doctor tomorrow and i really wanna try medication for my anxiety been wanting to try it since middle school.  I am turning 20 next month.  there’s a lot i avoid and i want to grow mentally and i know i am capable of MANY amazing things but i  <e2> don’t believe in myself </e2>  due to  <e1> my anxiety </e1> .  Realized it was a problem once i grew out of my shy phase, i’m terribly awkward and really tense and i just want to feel better and not on the verge of killing myself
suffering from OCD and fears over death/illness and half of it	my breathing or the thought of stopping breathing	I find myself worrying every now and then about  <e2> my breathing or the thought of stopping breathing </e2> .  I've had help for this fear in the past and know it's irrational but it's something that seems to overwhelm me from time to time, esp during times of stress.  I think half of it stems from  <e1> suffering from OCD and fears over death/illness and half of it </e1>  due to hyperventilation during panic attacks and that feeling of pure fear/lack of control during them (I've also had a parent die suddenly which may also be a factor, though I don't remember much about this because I was so young. )I'm just tired of feeling so worried about it and not sure how to get over the fear once and for all.  I think having to wear a mask during covid has also been both a blessing and a curse as it's felt like both something I can hide behind but also kind of suffocating too, at times.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
don’t get to organizing	never make any progress planning renovations	Hello everyone,I’m worried about what the process of hiring a cleaning service is like, and what I should do to prepare my home beforehand.  I have always been ashamed of my home since I was a teenager, and longstoryshort my home is cluttered and in need of renovation.  I struggle to focus on organizing it because I always feel bogged down trying to do all the more necessary/urgent/everyday upkeep of cleaning (dishes, laundry, caring for my cats and stepdaughter, etc. ), in addition to struggling with my mental health.  So, I  <e2> never make any progress planning renovations </e2>  because I  <e1> don’t get to organizing </e1>  since I can barely keep up with basic cleaning.  I want to try my best to make it easier for the professionals. . . I remembered that Reddit post about someone who wanted to try Subway but was anxious about the process. I suppose I’m just hoping that someone here might know what the process is like and how I can make it easier/not be rude by inviting cleaners into a home that is too challenging to clean?
Does	Thanks	Does anyone else have trouble eating when they’re with other people? It’s the weirdest thing.  My appetite is normally pretty decent but whenever I’m around anyone else, it feels like I’m forcing food down.  I get full quickly and really uncomfortable.  For example I’m having a cookout with some of my closest friends today, and even though I don’t really feel anxious in the moment, I can’t eat.  It’s really starting to affect my will to hang out with people because of course there’s always food in a social situation.  Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks
Looking	fired.	Looking for something with practical advice that I can apply in my life. To explain my problem in a few sentences.  I have been fired twice before and always get anxious of getting fired even at the smallest of mistakes.  I am not afraid of the financial aspect of getting fired but more the shame of getting fired and I can never hold a job.  I somehow always end up getting fired. 
To	nerves?	To keep it short, I (21 M) broke up with my girlfriend of three years 3 months ago, looking to start dating againEach time I get invited to do things with Girls I have been talking to online, I get extremely anxious, even if I have met them multiple times.  Tonight I am supposed to be meeting someone out and I feel like cancelling and have felt this way all week, I really want to see her but I am extremely nervous, any tips on how to calm the nerves?
watch them suffer	breaks my heart	I’m 19 and in college, but I can’t drive and I don’t make much money at my part time job on campus. My two closest family members are my mom and my boyfriend.  My mom constantly struggles with money and works two jobs.  As for my boyfriend, his life has just been giving him problem after problem and he’s hit rock bottom.  The most recent thing that happened is that his car key stopped working. I am trying to stay as rational as possible but a voice in my head keeps bothering me, saying that I can’t do anything for them and I’m practically useless as a family member.  I can’t drive my boyfriend anywhere or pay for his new key or buy him nice stuff.  And I pay my mom rent each month but I’m just afraid we won’t make enough to stay in our house for too much longer.  It  <e2> breaks my heart </e2>  to  <e1> watch them suffer </e1> .  Any advice on how to help them?
first time ever flying on a plane	nervous	Hello,This December will be my  <e1> first time ever flying on a plane </e1>  and I'm super  <e2> nervous </e2>  about it.  I am trying to keep my panic attacks to a minimum, but I know that one is probably inevitable.  Does anyone have any advice on how to fly with anxiety?Thanks!
I’m nervous	shouldn’t drive	Do anyone have driving anxiety? I have been having driving anxiety when I first started driving 2 years ago.  I also feel claustrophobic while driving too.  I usually freeze while driving and/or sometimes go extra slow or stop in the road for millisecond.  I always drive on the right lane.  But I also keep thinking about driver driving close behind me thinking I’m so slow or a bad driver.  I swear, I’m not a bad driver.  How do you get through it or get over it? I also keep remembering ppl telling me that I  <e2> shouldn’t drive </e2>  because  <e1> I’m nervous </e1> .  I’m nervous 24/7 even without driving.  PLEASE don’t shame me.  I did a lot of self shaming inside my head for it especially while driving. 
my living space isn’t clean	anxious	So I’ve noticed lately i get very  <e2> anxious </e2>  when  <e1> my living space isn’t clean </e1> .  Is this normal? Maybe it’s having something to do with what I can control?
It	here.	It usually happens when we are doing house chores.  Whenever my dad is doing something like doing the dishes or doing the laundry, it gives me anxiety about how he might scream at me for not helping him out in doing those things.  Don't get me wrong, I do help in various tasks around the house, but last year due the pandemic many things happened between me and my dad.  We fought a lot and he would say something so hurtful that it would knock the wind out of me, and all this because I am not really good at doing house chores, especially because my depression got bad.  Now, a year later even though he is calmer, somehow I get very anxious when he does some work.  And I end up crying even if he slightly raises his voice.  I don't know what to do.  I can't get out of the house because the Covid situation is very bad here. 
haven’t had an office job in 6 years	I’m worried about acclimatisation into the job	I start my new office job tomorrow and would really like some advice on settling my nervesI’m 22 and haven’t had a job in 2 years (I’ve been at Uni).  I  <e1> haven’t had an office job in 6 years </e1> , so  <e2> I’m worried about acclimatisation into the job </e2> . It’s an interesting job with a seemingly friendly workforce, but I can’t help but fear the unknown on this one.  I don’t really know what I’m going to be doing and that scares me a little. Hoping that they don’t shove me in the deep end and the first few days just take me in slowly. Any advice or kind words would be greatly appreciated
God	again.	God ive been so on edge for fucking hours and I can’t get a hold of myself how do you all calm yourselves down in such situations? I just don’t want this all to end in a panic attack again. 
anxiety is so bad	I’m in constant anticipation for the worst	So my mom has not dealt with the pandemic well at all.  She hates masks, thinks vaccine will kill us all, thinks that trump will magically come in and save the world, and that there is no where to find peace.  She instantly goes to the worst case scenario and/or conclusions.  My anxiety jumps every time she enters the room.  Is she going to be happy? Is she going to go on and on about her new findings on masks/vaccines? Is she going to be so angry she can’t calm down? It’s a roller coaster of emotions every day.  My  <e1> anxiety is so bad </e1>  because  <e2> I’m in constant anticipation for the worst </e2> .  I don’t know how to help or what to do.  She won’t go to a doctor, won’t see a therapist, and won’t take any advice.  Help please.  What can I do?
anxiety	raise mine quite a bit	TW : anxiety, heart related stuffHey, Basically wondering, because  <e1> anxiety </e1>  seems to  <e2> raise mine quite a bit </e2>  even when I am not into a full blown panic attack. Got it to 130 in a passenger ride earlier today.  Was definitely feeling anxious but damn. .  130 seems through the roof. . EDIT : to give context, RHR is around 65
I’m	appreciated	I’m usually fine the first 3 hours or so then when it comes time to sleep my brain goes crazy and then it goes all down hill from there.  I like being in my own bed and in my own room but I want to be able to spend a night at a friends or even my gf house.  I get this overwhelming fear that convinced me that I just can’t/ won’t be able to sleep unless I’m in my bed. Any advice is appreciated
from Argentina	so bad for english	Hello, im  <e1> from Argentina </e1> , so im  <e2> so bad for english </e2> , but here we goI am 17 years old and I have suffered panic and anxiety attacks since I was 13, the psychologists do not help me, they only tell me to calm down (wtf) and I do not feel that I should go to a psychiatrist but a psychologist has to tell me.  It all goes back to the same thing, an unbearable stomach pain, which makes me feel very sick, I went to the doctor several times to do studies and I have nothing, it is only my mind that says that I am going to vomit, and I am terrified of That, I don't want it to happen, I know I'm not going to die but it's impossible to convince myself that it's not going to happen, I already tried too many techniques and nothing calms that pain other than gastric medications.  Thank you for reading this far and I would like to receive your help :)

I	anxious.	I just graduated highschool and I decided I wanted to make games.  I’m afraid I can’t do it I’m feeling overwhelmed with what I’ll have to do and doubting myself.  I’ve started with coding for 30 minutes a day and I want to up it to 2 hours a day at least after vacation.  I want to do this I know I do it i’m just scared, nervous, anxious. 
depressed on top	dr prescribed me fluoxetine (20mg)	I have had GAD & emetophobia my entire life, but lately I’ve been  <e1> depressed on top </e1>  of that so my  <e2> dr prescribed me fluoxetine (20mg) </e2>  to help me through this rough patch. I was on Zoloft briefly when I was 7 or 8 & it made me suicidal, but now I’m 25.  I’m really scared to start taking it because I don’t want to get suicidal or be a statistic who’s brain gets permanently altered from an SSRI.  On top of that the fear gives me GI symptoms & dizziness, which freaks me out bc of my emetophobia.  Also dizziness and drowsiness are listed as side effects which freaks me out bc I don’t handle either of those sensations well. Please tell me about your positive experiences with SSRIs & reassure me I’ll be ok (no horror stories pls I know there are risks and finding the proper antidepressant can be a process)
I	lately.	I am my childs paid caregiver and had to switch agencies.   I had to take him with me to sign a bunch of onboarding documents and was very flustered.   They asked me what I was paid at my previous company.  I answered honestly and I didn't even THINK to do current research (in the pandemic pay for givers has gone up quite a bit) and I accepted a low offer.  A week later and I realized my mistake.   I panic and text not one,but 2 supervisors at 9pm on a Saturday about this.  I haveb4 years experience and anfew extra licenses.   But now I'm worried that I shit the bed.  I really don't want to have to change agencies again(it's been a time consuming the process and I am losing $ ).  I hope I can get the pay I deserve.  I'm just upset with myself.  I have really been struggling lately with my own disabilities and managing my childs as well.  I'm not very focused lately. 
myself and my little victories	proud	I am thankful for everything I have.  I’m  <e2> proud </e2>  of  <e1> myself and my little victories </e1> .  I don’t have to take this day all at once, one step, one breath, one moment at a time.  I am only one person and things will get done when they get done.  It’s okay to take breaks, it’s okay to take the day off.  It’s okay to feel hurt, confused,  and overwhelmed.  Be patient and have faith everything will work out in the future, just keep working on the present.  Take a deep breath and you’re going to be okay.  You are loved. 
Hi	away?	Hi guys!Hoping to get some support and any insight from others who have hypothyroidism and suffer from extreme anxiety.  I was diagnosed in February after weeks of panic attacks, low heart rate, weight gain, etc. The first few months I felt much better but this past month I’ve felt worse anxiety wise.  I notice that anxiety creeping back in and I don’t see my doctor again until mid June. How long did it take for your anxiety to go away?
When	one?	When the news comes, or if the trending google searches come up I get incredibly anxious for no reason.  My heart starts racing, and I don’t feel good until I see that there was nothing bad (on the news, or on trending searches) that day. Sometimes I just get worried that I’ll see something that I don’t want to see.  It makes me feel crazy being so worried all of the time, because it’s a vicious world that we live in, but I can’t help it.  Am I the only one?
sometimes	either.	sometimes i’m okay, and then i have a thought about how time is going by too fast or global warming or going to college and suddenly my chest gets tight and i can’t breathe.  i have to constantly be busy, being bored and alone is when it gets hardest.  it still comes over me at work sometimes (less than before).  i feel like i’m definitely better than i was before but i still feel extremely trapped and helpless.  i don’t want to be scared all the time.  everything feels so weird and out of place since i started getting bad.  i want everything to feel normal again, i’m tired of intrusive existential thoughts.  i don’t know where to go from here, i’m not at my worst but i’m not okay either. 
Right	it.	Right now I am on 12. 5 down from 15mg and plan to alternate between 12. 5 and 10 for 7 days before staying at 10mg for at least 14 days (or until I feel normal).  A while ago I saw on reddit someone saying if you have trouble tapering past a certain point, which I have had in the past, to skip one day with no lexapro before settling on your new dose (10mg).  The idea I think is to give you a reset and it will feel like 10mg is not too low anymore since you missed a day? I'm not sure if this is bs or not so I am wondering if anyone has heard of it or had success with it. 
So	you.	So I’m going to give a description of my OCD, even though I find it embarrassing, in the hope someone can help me rationalise this. So as one example, I’ve noticed that this one person reminds me a lot of someone I know.  I then looked into this person more and have found out that this person shares even more similarities with the person I know.  For example, I’ve also found out their reserved, into preservation, dark sense of humour, everyone likes them, both vegetarian, both in the same sort of profession, however for some reason I then need to find something that is different about these two, otherwise it makes me very anxious.  Maybe I’m worried of some sort of message to me, or there’s a reason for this for me, or something along those lines.  I can’t entirely express why it’s making me anxious… but I’m hoping someone out there who has insight into OCD can offer any advice.  Thank you. 
crying	give me advice or comfort	I've always had anxiety over death.  What if nothing comes after life.  And I'm feeling it strongly now.  If someone who believes in the afterlife or anything alike, or just on the same boat please  <e2> give me advice or comfort </e2>  because I feel like  <e1> crying </e1>  so much rn. I'm taking a course on death at uni for fun, thought if I was face to face with and studied some about it (or the idea about it) I might feel better.  Most part it's good but rn I'm reading 'Ross on the Fear of Death' and the lecture is specifically on anxiety and death. I just can't imagine it just ending.  Just like that.  And never again.  The never again part just makes me wanna cry. Needed to vent some, I'm.  Gonna go try calm myself down and maybe talk to mom, she's catholic and believes so might help. 
The noise of the cars and in the shop	panic attack	I had a panic attack while I was walking on the road.  I started to feel my heart going really fast, shaking, feeling sick, and crying so badly.   <e1> The noise of the cars and in the shop </e1>  is what triggered the  <e2> panic attack </e2> . I feel so exhausted now but I'm going to have a cold shower?. 
upset (angry, frustrated, sad, etc)	can't remember things	Does anyone else find that when you are <e1> upset (angry, frustrated, sad, etc) </e1> , later on you  <e2> can't remember things </e2> ? I don't drink alcohol or do hard drugs or anything.  It's just like, I get so wrapped up in what I'm feeling that I block it out and can't remember it clearly later.  Like if I'm angry and I go for a drive, I might not remember actually driving.  Idk, maybe this isn't even an anxiety thing and I'm just weird. 
I	tired.	I just need to tell someone how I feel. I started a new job a few days ago and it is extremely labor intensive for me.  I am aching and tired for a lot of the time. This morning I woke up at 3 am and couldn't get back to sleep.  Around 5 I was so anxious about going to work so tired that I threw up.  Just bile.  I am shaking and can't keep much down, but I have to wait to take my meds until I know I won't puke again. I'm so tired. 
you haven’t been sleeping much all week	fall asleep very shortly after closing your eyes	Like you’re so tired, and you know you’ll  <e2> fall asleep very shortly after closing your eyes </e2>  because  <e1> you haven’t been sleeping much all week </e1> ? But youa still have stuff to do because your brain is all “No, you’re not allowed to sleep until you make progress on these things”? But it’s 3 in the morning and you can’t find the motivation/mental energy to overcome your anxiousness-induced procrastination over doing the things? So now you’re just lying awake with your electronics doing jack shit because you feel too guilty to sleep and too scattered to do the things. . . Edit: haha tomorrow is going to be fun.  I need to wake up in 3 hours :(
I dont write everything down	freak out	I frantically make lists.  If  <e1> I dont write everything down </e1>  I  <e2> freak out </e2> .  I get OCD about shit.  I put too much on myself, cant prioritize it, then procrastinate.  I get stuck in my head and have a million different things running through my head that I need to do.  I'm tired of the constant chaos.  Why can't I just do things, and live life normally.  Even when I write it out, I feel like my life is spread thin, there's too much to be done and I'm going to not get it all done.  If something isn't in its right place or I lose something I lose it.  Wtf do I do?
glad	my husband encourage me to seek help	Hello all! Im new here.  Yesterday I went to my primary provider and talked about my anxiety for the first time.  Lately I've been thinking about how anxiety has been affecting me and realized that I've had it most of my life.  I am now 31 and so  <e1> glad </e1>  that  <e2> my husband encourage me to seek help </e2> .  Today is my first day taking medication for my anxiety.  Naturally I'm anxious about it but also relieved that I'm finally doing something about it. 
i	mind	i don’t even know how or what to say.  my mind just feels like a mess.  i hate this so much.  i feel so lost and helpless.  i am going to push people away.  i’m going to push my girlfriend away.  and i need her.  she’s all that i have.  it just gets worse and worse.  i break down and cry so much.  i’m literally getting 3-4 hours of sleep.  i really feel like i’m just losing my mind
take 0. 25mg of Clonazepam to sleep at night	I've been having really horrible dreams	I  <e1> take 0. 25mg of Clonazepam to sleep at night </e1> , and have been since last november.  Lately,  <e2> I've been having really horrible dreams </e2>  and I think that the meds might be to blame.  Its to the point where im genuienly afraid of sleeping at thins point.  If i stop taking them tonight, and go off them entirely, would this cause even worse side effects?
panic attack	my throat and chest hurt a bit	Title says it all.  Had my 2nd dose yesterday and felt great through the day! Woke up today feeling like complete crap, had a  <e1> panic attack </e1>  this morning and  <e2> my throat and chest hurt a bit </e2> .  Of course I know what it is (side effects) but doesn’t mean my anxious mind isn’t running wild.  This absolutely sucks!
my anxiety	feel like every job is too hard	Anyone else out here who has a hard time believing u will ever find a job that suits u and makes u more happy and relaxed? I  <e2> feel like every job is too hard </e2>  because of  <e1> my anxiety </e1>  and i never feel like i really like what i do. . 
I started getting a tingling feeling between my shoulder blades	see a chiropractor	Basically, a few months back,  <e1> I started getting a tingling feeling between my shoulder blades </e1>  that didn’t really hurt much… just felt weird.  It eventually got worse accompanied with some neck and back pain so I at long last decided to go  <e2> see a chiropractor </e2>  (he’s an actual doctor for what that’s worth).  Not long after that, I started feeling strange sensations in my right hand and now I’m hyper-focusing on every single feeling I get in my hands.  Its to the point where I swear certain fabrics feel rough. . .  but it seemingly comes and goes. Anyways, I promise this isn’t me seeking medical advice.  I’m just curious if anybody else has experience with this because I’m not sure if this is an actual problem that my doctors haven’t taken seriously, or if it’s somehow all in my head.  The past few days, I’ve almost convinced myself that if I don’t find an answer soon that I will lose nerve function permanently… As irrational as that may sound:/
I’ve	here?	I’ve been having bad cardiophobia and PVCs for about 4 months now.  It’s gotten more manageable and most days I can control it down to the level of an annoyance.  I’ve had some lorazepam and diazepam (not prescribed) on me “just in case” but for some irrational reason I’ve always been too scared to take them because I’m afraid it’ll lower my blood pressure too much or my heart rate.  I have a naturally lower BP so that’s part of the reason.  Any help here?
So	drop!	So my doctor recently recommended I try using Antihistamines to manage my issues.  At first I was skeptical because the only Antihistamine I was aware of was like Benadryl.  However, after looking in to what histamines are and how their effects on the brain I am intrigued.  He put me on a drug called hydrOXYzine and I was curious if anyone has ever tried these drugs.  Do they work for you? Do you know a better one? Have you experienced any side effects? The doctor said it is supposed to be much safer than taking Benzos especially long term.  Thanks for any insight you might be able to drop!
Feel	.	Feel very anxious and dissociated . 
I've	helpful!	I've been trying to Google the reason why you're supposed to take it the same way each time (always with food or always on an empty stomach) but I can't find any answers.  Does anyone know? I've been very forgetful of eating/not eating so I'm worried that I'm not getting the results I should be but I don't know.  Any insight would be helpful!
I	myself	I never believed anyone when they said, you gotta lose yourself to find yourself.  I always thought it was stupid.  Until it happened to me.  I'm totally lost and I have no clue what to do.  So many paths and I'm anxious if I take the wrong one, I'll regret my decisions like in the past.  I lost myself. . .  Now I need to find myself
the	know.	the drive there was fine, the social interaction was fine and no awkwardness, my day went fast and was fine despite only having 2 hours sleep last night.  why am i terrified of going back in tomorrow? i’m fine once i get there but the thought of having to be asleep by a certain time or i’ll be tired, waking up early, having to get ready and leave the comfort of my own home where i feel safe is just nerve wracking.  i don’t know why.  i suppose anxiety just sometimes doesn’t make sense.  i think the biggest thing for me is i’m comfortable at home and i have to leave that to go out and do things that require responsibility.  i don’t know. 
Whithdrawl is getting bad	panic attack	I feel like I'm about to burst into flames.  Moved to a new city yesterday for a new job, 3 states over from where I'm from.  Staying in a motel and have a sinus infectionForgot my medication which I've been on for 3+ years (zoloft, 200 mg).  Trying to get it filled, have to wait till of end day.  Haven't taken meds in almost a week.  Feeling the most anxious I've ever felt and am too anxious to call my prescribe again, as I feel like hed be mad at me and I dont feel that comfortable calling him.  Want to cry and scream.   <e1> Whithdrawl is getting bad </e1>  and am having  <e2> panic attack </e2>  about what and how will happen when I go back on my meds.  I'm probably just being a big baby but I need to put this out into the world. 
I’ve	overthinking.	I’ve been reserved for a while after talking alot/being outspoken has made me friends think I am mean or frank.  I’d like to believe I’ve changed but recently at a party where drinks were involved I got a bit loud and I fear now that my new friends don’t like me.  I haven’t had new friends in a while either so I guess it just means a lot to me? Should I be worried I said something I don’t remember because I was drunk? Who knows.  Maybe I’m just overthinking. 
Wow,	it.	Wow, I’m literally shaking and all I did was answer a dozen questions on the NHS app.  It gets sent to my doctor’s office and they get in contact, I think. I’m very pleased with myself as I’ve been trying to do this for months and, even before that, knew something was wrong.  All it involved was some “how often do you feel. . . . . ” questions, some questions about mood and a quick sentence about what I was hoping to achieve by getting in contact. I stated I didn’t have a particular idea about exactly what I wanted, it really wasn’t too hard. I feel that this first, simple step, has been a small hurdle that I blew out of proportion for so long and I’m pleased I got this done.  I really recommend anyone else, who hasn’t already, should take this first step as I feel amazing now (relatively speaking). In the unlikely event anyone else is inspired to get their first, or next, step started after putting it off I would genuinely be delighted to hear about it. 
I've	3:	I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and panic attacks last week and my doc prescribed Veniz XR 37. 5 for daily intake (anxiety) and Lonazep MD (Clonazepam) 0. 25 for emergency (panic attacks).  It's been 5 days since I started taking the meds.  Right after the first day, I started experiencing following (side) effects:Day 1:Stomach achingContinuous nauseaMuscle pain (moderately)Shivering hands and restless leg (I took a lonazep (clonazepam) and fixed it)Felt too sleepy so had to go to bed so earlyDay 2:Had difficulty in walking, standing straight or holding anything right after waking upExtreme mood swingsDepressed thoughts (even suicidal tendencies)Got shivering hand while sleeping daytime, and it scared the shit outta me when my roommate woke me upFell asleep at night, but felt like I went unconscious (I couldn't remember anything around that time much)Day 3:
Hello,	helps!	Hello, I struggle a lot with self-confidence.  Minor flaws seem to outweigh any sense of positives, almost like I don’t “deserve” to think higher of myself.  I tend to stay inside, and am only happy when I’m working (server) with people I’m incredibly comfortable with.  I’ve noticed this trend a LOT in my life.  Starting passion projects and stopping when it gets hard, not wanting to go out in fear of judgement, not able to start conversations with strangers, etc.  I have been given the advice to try things outside of my comfort zone to gain confidence but everything I think of still seems scary. How do you get over that wall of constant fear? Are there any small things/ideas to start off with to ease into it, or is it only possible to jump into the deep end.  Anything helps!
I’ll begetting my second dose of the vaccine	anxious	Title says it all, I’ve been very  <e2> anxious </e2>  today simply because  <e1> I’ll begetting my second dose of the vaccine </e1>  tomorrow.  I’m more particularly scared of the side effects (fever, headache, body aches etc. ) My first panic attack occurred when I had a bad case of the flu and ever since then I just haven’t been 100%.  I have constant body aches, thinking I have a fever but temp is always good, General weakness, faint sensations etc
Hi,What	brain.	Hi,What kind of tricks work for you when trying to calm your anxiety down when going to bed.  I feel like Youtube crime videos help me sometimes, but not always. .  so i need more tips and tricks. I feel like i need to have something on, I just can't go to bed and fall asleep.  Then I will never fall asleep, because I have nothing to distract my thoughts.  Reading books just wears my eyes out, but doesn't really put me to sleep in the end.  Also, while reading books, i still feel anxious for some reason.  I guess it's the unconscious brain. 
I	anxiety.	I started Abilify 5 days ago.  I feel like complete crap.  Nausea, low BP, lightheaded, diarrhea.  I'm not ill. Is this worth sticking with? How long before I feel better?I have anxiety. 
Friend	?	Friend who knows I like her posted happy Mother’s Day.  Cool.  She has a service dog and I said:[service dog] says happy Mother’s Day!I waited a couple minutes and got anxious that would come off weird or whatever, didn’t want to be seen in a bad light, so deleted the comment. . .  right choice?I’m silly. . .  I just wanted to have a conversation with her but she’s been dealing with a lot and. . .  I haven’t heard from her in a couple weeks ?
My panic attacks	feel so alone	I am writing this with tears welled up in my eyes .   <e1> My panic attacks </e1>  have gone worse this year with the added stress of the Pandemic.  There are days when I  <e2> feel so alone </e2> ,I fear if anyone would even understand what goes in my brain. .  I've tried therapy but for some reason I'm unable to open up to my therapist.  My hands shake and I tremble with fear some days and all I long for is someone to actually hug me and tell me it's going yo be okay .  I live with my parents and they've issues of their own and I don't want to add mine to theirs , and I feel extremely overwhelmed and cannot talk to my friends about it . 
I left a tennis bracelet on a desk	couldn’t sleep	Something as simple as me not being able to find the shirt I wanna wear in the morning will have me worried to the point where I self destruct and ruin other peoples days.  I drove to work at 1 in the morning because  <e1> I left a tennis bracelet on a desk </e1>  and  <e2> couldn’t sleep </e2>  even though I knew exactly where it was.  Simple things people keep telling me to get over make me feel like ants are crawling over me. . . 
I	chance	I have family where its might land some in South Florida, Haiti, and the DR, ik the chance of something happening is low but there still is a chance
My hands and feet are cold	anxiety	 <e1> My hands and feet are cold </e1>  on a daily basis.  I’m trying to figure out why but I’m thinking it’s due to  <e2> anxiety </e2> .  Can stress and anxiety cause this? Anyone here get these symptoms?
Recently	down.	Recently on the 27 April in Aylesham.  Ms James was murdered walking her dog near her house.  That is two miles away from where I live. Honestly I never really felt scared and anxious until now, my parents often take runs separately.  But now they have stopped.  I go to a Boarding school an hour away.  And I return home on the weekends.  But I feel scared for my Mums and my Dads safety.   I have three younger siblings and if the worse were to happen I can’t even imagine the possibilities. There are no police leads and I am scared for my parents.  What should I do to try to keep my anxiety down. 
So	information?	So I think I know why I’ve feared all these things.  My parents always looked down on the things I’m about to mention (as they should with some).  But I’ve fear being schizophrenic in fear people would see me differently.  I feared being gay in fear people would abandon me.  I feared being a psychopath in fear of ruining my life and others.  And right now I fear being a pedophile for the same reason as the psychopath.  Is this all due to my true fear of being rejected by my loved ones? If that is true then that’s the root cause of my OCD.  So now what do I do with this information?
So	yet	So I just entered a relationship the other week, she said she has really bad anxiety, which I know very little about.   I wanna ask if there's any common mistakes people make with their anxious SO, the do's and don'ts.   What stuff I should ask her since I don't know where to begin.   She also hasn't dated anyone before me so she doesn't really have an understanding of how it would effect her relationships yet
It’s	over.	It’s usually just a small part of songs but it’s usually a different song everyday.  I feel like I do it subconsciously to stop the racing thoughts that come with my anxiety.  I’m really curious if I’m alone in this.  It ruins songs for me half the time because I just repeat the same part over and over. 
Likely	sometimes.	Likely I'll never marry and have any children.  Don't have any close friends I keep in regular contact with.  If things are still like this when I'm old, what if my mental state starts to deteriorate? How will I know to take care of myself properly? After I die, what'll happen to all of my things? Either everything will turn to rubbles or the govt will collect everything.  I like being alone but fear that it'll actually make things worse for me in the long run.  Sure I could end up with lots of money in the end but what's the point when there isn't anyone to share it with? The future just seems bleak sometimes. 
Does	myself.	Does anybody else get the same feeling/sensation? Whenever I went to the hospital for anxious related problems they never took me seriously or didn’t even try to help.  I don’t want to embarrass myself. 
smoking	increased my anxiety	I am a current smoker &  <e1> smoking </e1>  has  <e2> increased my anxiety </e2> .  Now I do want to quit but I believe I’m anxious about the anxiety and depression that I will get.  How do I overcome that?
anxious	cant calm my nerves	I keep feeling like this is it.  Derealization is sucking and im so  <e1> anxious </e1>  i  <e2> cant calm my nerves </e2>  and i was shivering earlier.  I keep getting this underlying feeling of impending doom and fear of me dying.  Ive experienced it before but not like this.  Idk if im gonna be able to sleep tonight.  It could also be hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia because im diabetic but my sugars arent that bad so im just kinda freaking out in my head.  I just want to feel normal at this point.  I dont know why im like this. 
waking	to.	waking up every day is so hard, my thoughts make me so foggy and tired all the time.  i don’t know where to go or who to ask for help.  i feel like i’m too far gone, i have intrusive existential thoughts that terrify me.  i tried to get by myself but it’s so hard.  it’s hard to open up to my mom about stuff like this, and i’m (18f) not exactly at a point in my life where i can give up and rest.  i feel like i would pose as such a burden right now.  i just need someone to talk to. 
TLDR:	thanks.	TLDR: horribly abusive childhood, memory gaps, will therapy help or make it worse?I’m 27 and I’ve suffered from anxiety my entire life.  Unfortunately as my parents were immigrants from a country that doesn’t take mental health seriously so I didn’t even know what I was feeling was anxiety until I began dating my husband over ten years ago.  I’ve been taking medication for it for about six years and I’ve slowly been healing from everything.  I had a horrible childhood from abusive parents, to being molested by multiple people throughout it.  I’m just tired of having low self esteem.  I’ve never gone to a therapist for this and I’m not sure where to even begin.  I feel like I have these crazy memory gaps and only the really vivid memories remain.  My insurance only covers offices that are hours away from me with appointments booked for weeks/months.  Are there any other options? Would it even help? I’m in the process of looking for a new job and honestly don’t want to open up to someone just to find out they don’t take my new insurance.  Jus looking for advice, thanks. 
So,	it.	So, I was playing Hollow Knight, and I noticed that sometimes I get pretty fidgety during boss fights.  Especially with Absolute Radiance.  It's a quite overwhelming boss, but I think my reaction to it is way too exaggerated.  I didn't even take the game that seriusly, I was just practicing, but I get shaky, my palms are sweating, and even minutes after, I feel weak in my limbs.  It's just so ridiculous, that I'm doing something just for fun, but my body acts like my life depends on it. 
Question	sorts	Question regarding Chemical ImbalanceI understand that anxiety and depression are essentially a state of chemical imbalance in the brain, whether it be in stagnating levels of serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine etc. My question is does Effexor help to fix that chemical imbalance that is caused over time by having the body reach a chemical homeostasis (healthy levels of these chemicals)I went into a full blown out depression over a year when I quit my adderall cold  turkey, was using 50 mg so I am trying to understand and am hopeful that I can fix this imbalance of sorts
i’ve	it	i’ve been horribly anxious for the past few days and i bought one of my favorite games to play and i should be at least a little bit happy but i just feel so wrong.  like i just have this bad feeling like something bad’s gonna happen or like a sense of doom and i’m all nervous and i’m scared it’s my intuition or something?? but then again i’m a very anxious person and i’ve had this bad feeling before and nothing came of it
im	it?	im like 16 why am I so afraid of it I just want to have better memory again does anyone have advice on how to do it?
lately	me.	lately i've been feeling so overwhelmed by everything, and i feel like i can't trust anyone.  i'm swamped with schoolwork as i finish my 3rd year of college and i feel like i have so much pressure on me that i want to shut down.  i also have grown so paranoid of all of my friendships except like, one or two, and i keep getting paranoid that either something is going on that i caused or that i did something wrong, but won't say anything.  i keep ruminating on it and no matter what i do, i can't stop thinking about it.  even after switching meds a few months ago, i still feel like i can't get out of my own head. i just wish i didn't feel like such a burden or bad person because i keep having these thoughts, but i feel like no one understands me. 
I’m	?	I’m getting my blood drawn tomorrow due to my health anxiety fears, and I wasn’t really worried anymore but now that’s it’s close all my fears are back. My anxiety won’t stop with the what if it’s this what if your dying I don’t know how I’m gonna deal with waiting for the results :( any advice would be appreciatedI’m driving myself insane I’m only 15 so I know the chances of it being cancer or anything is so so slim, but my anxiety is constantly rushing into my brain I was planning stuff for summer and anxiety is like don’t waste your time your gonna be dying it’s exhausting ?
ive been smoking a bit of weed	help with the anxiety	Tomorrow i will be getting an endoscopy to determine if the globus sensation i have been getting constantly is being caused by anxiety or if there is something actually wrong with my throat.  It will also be my first time being put under for any medical procedure.   <e1> ive been smoking a bit of weed </e1>  to try to  <e2> help with the anxiety </e2>  but it ended up giving me more when i heard it is possible if you smoke weed the anasthesia wont work as well.  overall just extremely anxious for tomorrow and just in general.  if anyone has experienced a similar situation or has any encouragement/thoughts please comment on this post so i can try to feel less lonely in this.  ill update this post after the procedure happens tomorrow as well
anxiety	my body is extremely sore & tense	I’ve been suffering from  <e1> anxiety </e1>  for as long as I can remember but it has only gotten worse in the past 3 years & recently I’ve noticed  <e2> my body is extremely sore & tense </e2> .  Also my left side gets a little tingling so I’m kinda freaking myself out & making my anxiety even WORSE! I just want to know if it’s normal for your body to be sore due to anxiety.  I did go to the doctor on Friday & she prescribed me Zoloft & Flexeril for my tension headaches, I’m starting the Zoloft tonight which I’m also a little nervous about but I’m just hoping & praying it will be my magical pill .  If anyone could let me know if anxiety can cause your whole body to be sore & if anyone has any advice  or tips please feel free to gimme them all .  I greatly appreciate you guys! ?
when we text each other	I'll get anxious and experience panic attacks and stuff	I don't know if this is the right subreddit, but whatever.  So there's this girl I liked, 99. 9% sure she likes me as well.  90% of the time  <e1> when we text each other </e1>   <e2> I'll get anxious and experience panic attacks and stuff </e2> .  I can talk to all other girls without feeling that way, but she makes me anxious and i don't even know why.  She's not a super popular girl, she's an introvert like me.  My friends and family say I'm in love, I'm kinda perplexed lmao.  I've never been anxious to talk to anybody but her.  Has anyone else felt the same and how can I stopping being an anxious little shit?
it is my birthday	I feel extremely stressed	So as the title says tomorrow  <e1> it is my birthday </e1>  and  <e2> I feel extremely stressed </e2> . I don’t like the attention at all and I hate everything about it. I am even considering not going to school.  I know it sounds stupid to the majority of people but I for some reason feel awful I don’t know what to do about it. Usually am not that anxious but this for some reason triggers me and I don’t know why.  I just wanted to get this out off my chest because I don’t think any of my friends will understand the way I feel. 
Whenever	me.	Whenever I'm having a good time, any little screw up can mess it up.  Somebody's tone sounding a bit reprimanding, something I did that was slightly embarrassing and nobody even noticed, thinking I made someone uncomfortable by being shy etc.  And when it's not these things I feel like people are just silently judging me.  How do I cope with or get rid of this feeling? It's so awful, I just want to enjoy things without this feeling of worry consuming me. 
severe panic attack	I skipped the morning session	Had a really  <e1> severe panic attack </e1>  this morning before going to school.   <e2> I skipped the morning session </e2> .  I'll be there in the afternoon anyways because we have a group presentation and I don't want to affect anyone's grades.  Now I'm panicking about what will I say to them in the afternoon.  Sick? Happened before I don't want to talk about my anxiety because I feel so uncomfortable talking about it.  I've did it once and it became everyone's joke , plus it will make me seem like I'm just slacking off even tho I'm not.  I try so hard at everything and I go nowhere  Right now I feel like I am literally looking for anything to worry about more .  I feel so frustrated I needed to write this down somewhere and get it off my chest. 
anxiety-nausea	vomiting	This is gonna sound a lil tmi, but has anyone had  <e1> anxiety-nausea </e1>  that leads to  <e2> vomiting </e2> ? Every morning for the past week and half at least- I wake up, and roughly half an hour later, when I get my anxiety attacks before work, I get nausea and throw up! It's crazy! I didn't smoke the past few days just to see if it was the pot.  I also don't drink too much coffee and water on an empty stomach in the mornings just in-case. . .  Seems like it always happens right after/during an anxiety attack. Has anyone experienced this? If so, what helps? I take shallow breaths and sometimes chew gum to moist my throat (anxiety attacks make my throat dry and tight), but at the end of the day, nothing truly works. 
I get so nervous over every little thing	frustrating	First time posting here, will change flair if needed. My mother had anxiety when she was my age and when I tell her my woes she tells me that I will grow out of it when I get older. Is this true? I want to grow out of it and it's  <e2> frustrating </e2>  because  <e1> I get so nervous over every little thing </e1> , my mother tells me I have a negative view point and that if she 'indulged' into my anxiety it would only make it worse.  Will having a more positive outlook alleviate my feelings on a matter?I told her that I only wanted her to understand that these things take a toll on me, I wasn't telling her that she needed to shelter me from everything.  She keeps relating her experience with anxiety to my own, but it feels like we are leagues apart and she is projecting what worked for her onto me. She tries to relate to me with her own experience but I can only see it as dismissive. 
I	better.	I can't tell you how many people I've met that have remarked on how nervous I look, I tell them I have anxiety, and they tell me to just calm down.  Don't be nervous.  No reason to be scared.  They even ask why I have anxiety? It's a medical condition.  You wouldn't ask someone why they have diabetes.  It's a hard thing to go through.  It has no rhyme or reason.  It just is.  I'm tired of having to tell people that.  Especially doctors who should know better. 
fear of judgement	social anxiety	this is a thought that automatically pops into my head every single time someone’s energy shifts.  whether their facial expression changes or they abbreviate a word through text, my first thought is “they hate me. ”then i end up overthinking and listing a ton of possibilities for things i did wrong and the amount of ANXIETY this causes is so overwhelming because i believe a big part of  <e2> social anxiety </e2>  is  <e1> fear of judgement </e1> . “im being annoying” “i’m probably being boring” “i must have offended them” - intrusive thoughts keep coming and i don’t know how to get them to stop and i just want to cry. 
Money	makes me immensely depressed and crazy anxious	 <e1> Money </e1>   <e2> makes me immensely depressed and crazy anxious </e2> .  I feel horrible for making my parents take me to see my boyfriend.  They have to spend something insane like 3000.  It disgusts me that I only can only pay 15% of that.  I already spend less time with my parents than I want to.  I NEED to learn how to drive no matter how fucking nerve racking that is.  I NEED a job so I can make myself at least feel slightly better knowing my parents spend less money on me.  I am a horrible worker so idk how that will turn out, but I need to do it.  I would probably end up feeling shitier if I had a job because I would spend even less time with my family and friends.  Fuck. 
my anxious thoughts are disappearing	the therapy is beneficial	Okay so I started therapy a month ago with a clinical social worker that has a Ph. D. I can say that I feel so much better, and  <e1> my anxious thoughts are disappearing </e1> , I’m learning how strong the power of self-talk is. .  I can say that  <e2> the therapy is beneficial </e2> . . But. . .  I asked her the last session we had about something I read in the internet, it was written there that someone with anxiety would be likely to have it again in the future.  She answered this with that she can’t tell me if I’ll have it in the future, but she told me that I’m a sensitive person who tends to have anxiety, BUT I’ll spot that it’s anxiety from the very start and I’ll know how to handle it.  She continued this with that everyone has anxious thoughts, but it depends on how strong the anxiety is and how frequent. I felt shit after the session that I may suffer again from this, and who knows if I’ll ever be fully cured.  I had it for only 1. 5 months including physical symptoms and I don’t want it with me.  I want to be normal. 
I'm anxious	gave me redormin	past few nights have been just. . .  traumatizing.  as soon as i lie down to sleep I feel heart skips and heart palpitations for quite a long time until I'm too tired to think of them and i fall asleep exhausted.  it's like a negative feedback loop where i get a few skips, panic abt them, get more because  <e1> I'm anxious </e1>  and then get anxious abt those and aaa :/i went to a doctor who  <e2> gave me redormin </e2>  for sleep and told me the skips are harmless, then said i could do an ecg if i really wanted to.  i can't get one until a few days soooo if i want that extra reassurance i have to wait and try to sleep well through the nights :c my first dose of redormin last night didn't do too much although it calmed me down for the first hour. the skips scare me mainly cuz they're more frequent than I usually had them, unless when I've been really nervous? idk just wanted to get this off my chest (haha)
A	luck!	A year ago, with plans to meet my friends the next day, I left everything behind.  I ghosted everyone.  My hometown friends, college friends, outside friends, responsibilities in school, student council, club activities, everything was abandoned.  I was hospitalized for a week.  For months, I couldn't bear to look at my phone.  I ended up getting a new phone to make therapy appointments and take baby steps into the outside world.  For a year, the only people I had contact with were a few family members, my therapist, and my psychiatrist.  Today, on a whim greatly credited to my therapist, I texted my friend.  She was so happy and kind and demanded we meet right now.  Even though I'm scared (what do i say? what am i wearing? am i happy? sad? grateful? sorry? how much do i tell?), I'm glad that I'm meeting my friend right away because a) I missed her and b) I can't bear the anxiety of waiting to meet her at a later date. Anyways, I think this might be a significantly bigger—but still tiny—step outside.  Wish me luck!
Mine is the noise of the shower	I used to wake up as a kid to the humming of the shower every morning	 <e1> Mine is the noise of the shower </e1> .  I think it’s cause  <e2> I used to wake up as a kid to the humming of the shower every morning </e2> .  It’s very peaceful to me.  Does anybody else have weird things like that that relax them? ?
Did	anxiety?	Did your therapists ask you certain questions that revealed how your anxiety started? How did they help you identify triggers and separate stimuli in any given situation to get to the core of your anxiety at the moment? Is there a method they taught you and that you used (or didn’t) to sort of chart the start and progress of your anxiety?
my PDD	I hate reading	So I am curious if this is a me thing or a ASD thing? If it is an ASD thing, it makes me wish I had sought an accommodation in college, but is reading tough for anyone else with ASD? Do we naturally struggle to read?I always chalked it up to maybe undiagnosed dyslexia or something, but I hate reading and I never understood why.  Just wondering if it is because of  <e1> my PDD </e1>   <e2> I hate reading </e2> . 
why this bothered me so much	no one likes to be interrupted	I always dread seeing family that I don’t see normally.  They act excited to see me and want to know about my current interests but cut me off and don’t even let me finish a sentence. I never knew  <e1> why this bothered me so much </e1> , (other than your typical reasons because  <e2> no one likes to be interrupted </e2> ), but it never made sense to me why NT’s get us all excited to talk about our interests/lives and then stop us mid excited rant.  I always get so excited to talk about things I’m doing and it’s such a let down when I get interrupted. Can anyone else relate?
I didn't know how to label my emotions	I labeled every single emotion as sad or depressed	That's my exact situation. . . it used to be so bad that  <e1> I didn't know how to label my emotions </e1>  so  <e2> I labeled every single emotion as sad or depressed </e2> . . . . . I do have a diagnosis for aspergers / autism. I feel like a lot of movies portray people with autism as emotionless robots and I feel like that's really not the case. . what do you guys think?
I referenced my sister	I want to be as educated as possible through out her life	Hi!My 5 year old sister is on the spectrum and I’ve always wondered if there were certain phrases or wording in reference to ASD that is triggering or demeaning? <e1> I referenced my sister </e1>  because  <e2> I want to be as educated as possible through out her life </e2> .  One day I can ask her the same question and she can give me her own opinion. . .  but until then!Thanks in advance
Some	hobbies.	Some people are still worried that I still have poor social skills, but I am good at reading and understanding emotions, facial and body languages. Is social skills much more than that?I am sorry if I was wrong about having social skills. From my early childhood to adulthood, I had difficulty socializing with others effectively. I would only talk about things that fits my specific subjects of interest, often manifesting as a borderline obsession with a few areas and/or hobbies.

Link	wellAndy	Link >>>  be/a8KXt6VBPr4So we all hear of a meltdown and/or knows what it's like.  But I made this where I talk about what an autistic meltdown is from my perspective, why they happen and some tips on how you can help an autistic going through a meltdown. This video is really to inform those who don't know what it is or what goes through the mind of an autistic person who a meltdown to really help others understand. I am always open to suggestions on topics I should cover on my YouTube channel so please feel free to let me know what I should cover. Thanks & hope you are doing wellAndy
hi	experiences	hi reddit,i'm curious to find out if any of you believe that gaming has helped improve your social skills for real life situations?i've found that there aren't many studies about this so i'm currently carrying out research to find out what peoples views are. if you'd like to complete my survey i'd be very grateful  onlinesurveys. ac. uk/autism-and-online-video-gamesplease post your views here as well, it would be great to hear about any personal experiences
I've felt like I've had a form of autism	I've never been diagnosed	Hi there, for the past 6 months or so  <e1> I've felt like I've had a form of autism </e1>  but I've never been able to tell anyone.  Because of this  <e2> I've never been diagnosed </e2>  and so I was hoping this would be the best way to see. So I was watching an episode of one of my favorite shows and it talked about a possibility of one of the characters having Aspergers, the episode listed several symptoms: Social awkwardness (I can't talk to people in person and I always bounce my leg up and down which annoys people) ,  Narrowed interests (I talk to my mom about anime and video games all of the time when she could care less), and I have a hard time understanding people and a few more. After I watched that I went online to find a test online and found one from Cambridge that said there is a high possibility that I have it. I've asked some of my online friends and I've gotten mixed answers so, do I have it? Please I just need a straight forward answer but I'll be happy to answer any questions
A	Thanks!.	A small team that I'm involved with put together a website to help those on the spectrum. I (the developer) teamed up with a TSS with an idea to help bridge the gap between therapists and patients and the communication breakdown concerning the progress of those on the spectrum. While the idea initially targeted therapists, the tools can really be used by anyone (parents,yourself,etc) who'd like to keep a log on how either you or someone else is progressing. We are start-up who recently successfully completed an startup incubator program, and are interviewing for others in the next couple months. We launched an open beta today and it can be seen at  asdprogress. com .   To sign up, just choose the bronze monthly option.  There is no charge. We are looking forward to feedback, both positive and negative, on how we can improve.    I'll do my best to answer everyone's questions here, or through PM's.   Thanks!.

I feel so isolated.  And I wish I didn't	I wanna socialize with other people more often irl	The title might be a little too specific, but the point is, I sometimes feel a little too isolated with people, especially back then when I was in school.  I can get attached to people, like my friends, my family, and other people like my family friends, but for the most part  <e1> I feel so isolated.  And I wish I didn't </e1> , because  <e2> I wanna socialize with other people more often irl </e2> , in fact that was my New Year's Resolution last year, but COVID came along. 
they'll look at me with a blank stare	Its driving me crazy	It seems like everytime I try to have a conversation with someone neurotypical, it's inevitable that at some point in the conversation I'll say something and  <e1> they'll look at me with a blank stare </e1> .  <e2> Its driving me crazy </e2>  that I can never figure out what they're thinking when they do that.  I feel like its obvious that they think I've said something strange but when I ask them if they think I'm weird or awkward they say no. I cant figure out what causes it either because I think what I'm saying is normal, and I cant find any fault with it but they always look at me like I have a third eye. 
Im taking a law class	it s very important to know and remember specific terminology	 <e1> Im taking a law class </e1> , and so  <e2> it s very important to know and remember specific terminology </e2>  but certain words no matter how hard i try i can't remember. One of them is exploitation i ve been saying the word constantly the entire day i don't think about it for a few mins and i forgot it all i can think  of are words that are close like  expansion or extort. Have any of you have any advice so i can finally be able to memorize the word and continue on. 
in the south sayings are deeply rooted in the vernacular	I felt it was a must to learn sayings	Sarcasm is a no go and sayings I think about too literally such as the title absolutely disgust me.  When people use sayings like this I think about having skin on my teeth and equate that to Moose, deer, or other antelered creatures shedding their antler velvet and I just get so disgusted and just not wanting to continue the conversation. By now I understand some things are just sayings and have learned on my own what they mean but personally I would never use them.  I live in the south and idk if it's a thing everywhere but  <e1> in the south sayings are deeply rooted in the vernacular </e1>  which is why  <e2> I felt it was a must to learn sayings </e2> . Anyone else find difficulty such as I? Or do you understand and have a saying that you dislike or whatever it may be?Edit: forgot like the words tommarow correctly spelled tomorrow. . .  I spell it incorrectly because I think it should be spelled tommarow.  There are other words I do this with but I can't remember rn
I'm	etc).	I'm curious about everyone's interests.  Mines are the spy genre (mostly James Bond), Sci-Fi/Monster/B-Movies, world history, foreign movies & old-school cartoons (Looney Tunes & Droopy, etc). 
I	opposite?	I have nothing more to say about this LOL.  I do not know if I was ever able to make passable eye contact but I became concerned that I wasn't passing like 8-10 years ago and did this googling and am now completely gaze avoidant. When you walk by someone (both of you walking toward each other and passing each other) do you meet their eyes? Is that what NTs expect? Or do they expect the opposite?
I've	spectrum?	I've noticed I do this a lot when I'm certain they are in the wrong and it has caused me some troubles.  I guess they think I am some sort of snob or that I am  a stubborn person who needs to be right.  When I get it wrong I do apologise though.  Is this typical for people on the spectrum?
I	me.	I posted this diagram I made on r/aspergirls and it helped quite some people.  I hope with this diagram you can see that autism can have positive sides.  redd. it/eas9uu1xao171. jpgThis is my view on my personal autism traits that I think are positive.  Everybody is different so don't feel discouraged if you don't have the same positive traits.  There might be quite some overlap between neurotypical and autistic people.  The difference is in the intensity and combination of all traits. My positive autism traits might not be compatible to everyone.  Meaning I think something is great but others might not.  That is fine.  As long as I see it as a positive thing. One last note is that these positive traits can also become an obstacle.  For example perfectionism can be very exhausting.  Open minded can get you into socially awkward situations. I am very pleased with these positive traits.  It makes me, me. 
Autistic	agree?	Autistic pride is fucked up! They say people with low functioning autism are normal and are just different.  They are not different, many of the low functioning autistic are nonverbal and cant even spell their own name! They can’t understand that they are even alive! Autistic pride should have been for the high functioning autistics and not the lower ones.  Oh and the founder of it agrees that low functioning autism is normal as well, what kind of fucking idiot is he!!??Anyone else here agree?
I'm not down	casually popping by	Long time lurker here who had the light bulb go on a few months back.   So. . .  does anybody here need time to get mentally prepared before you basically do anything?Like, if I'm going to the grocery store, I tell myself that I need to go like a day or two before I actually go.   Or if I'm going to have a social event, it has to be on my calendar,  <e1> I'm not down </e1>  with just  <e2> casually popping by </e2> . The only thing I don't really need to mentally prepare for is my special interest (which also happened to be my job, so that was cool). This used to drive me nuts and I wondered if any ASDs also had a similar experience?
I’m	now.	I’m 19 and I feel so immature, less experienced, and unaccomplished compared to most normal 19 year olds and people younger than me maybe like (16-18).  I have still trouble making eye contact, changing the tone of my voice, making genuine convos.  I also have meltdowns and have a hard time trying to get a driver licenses, job, and open a bank account for myself even tho i’m not in school right now. 
I get hooked on topics easily	surprise lol	Hello!I had an idea and wanted to give it a shot!I was thinking about finding people that would be interested in sharing their special interest with me and we can both go down the research rabbit hole.  <e1> I get hooked on topics easily </e1>  ( <e2> surprise lol </e2> )We could message and present new information and/or research material regularly. I think this could be an amazing alternative to traditional socializing that really plays off the strengths of someone with ASD. I’m in southern US - central time zone.  You can be anywhere. I would prefer to stay away from controversial or triggering topics. Otherwise. . . seriously. . . bring any topic.  I once had a coworker reference something about Antarctica and by the time I came back from lunch that day-I flooded him with more than he ever knew he didn’t want to know about Antarctica lol.  I still have it loaded on my weather page and from time to time still look into the different research stations that are there. So let’s geek out on a topic no one else cares about!
I should stick to occasionally smoking weed	it’s something that I’d probably never use habitually	Before the pandemic, I was a moderate drinker.  Once everything started to close down and I got Covid myself, I took to drinking all day to pass the time.  More than a year later, with things gradually returning to normal (at least where I live), the habit has stuck and I consider myself an alcoholic.  I use it to cope with things I don’t like, even though I’m really trying to cut back or quit drinking all together if I have to.  Sadly, I also think drinking and going out to bars helps me socialize.  Anyone else here who has a drinking problem or an addictive personality?Edit: A lot of good answers here.  Unfortunately, alcoholism is something that runs in my family.  I occasionally smoke weed, I have a half finished blunt, a preroll that I haven’t touched even though I bought it months ago, and a lot of flower left over.  Perhaps  <e1> I should stick to occasionally smoking weed </e1>  since  <e2> it’s something that I’d probably never use habitually </e2> , unlike alcohol. 
ASD	Im getting sluggish and feel barely able to do the job	I'm curious.  I think its unlikely but sometimes I think it may be caused by  <e1> ASD </e1>  somehow. I'm quite strong guy but when it comes to psychical work like moving furniture, packing, etc. , anything that includes using strength  <e2> Im getting sluggish and feel barely able to do the job </e2> . I also hated it and was nervous whenever mum or dad asked me to do sth, especially when I was doing sth connected with special interest at the time.  So maybe it's some defend reaction against doing something I dont wanna do. I'm healthy in overall so I don't think its health issue. 
Hi	experience?	Hi everyone,I'm just curious if anyone else has a similar experience with mouth feel and taste of food? Sometimes I'll make myself something, can be something I've eaten before.  This time it was a salad, and sometimes it'll be fine, then sometimes just one thing will be off (this time it was the dressing, before it was a piece of tomato, ect) and I literally have to spit it out, and at the worst it makes me feel physically ill.  Then my mouth goes on like high alert for who knows how long and so many more things cause this.  It's usually wet things that cause this for me so I end up relegated to eating the driest of foods for a while until it goes away.  Like a week or two. It's frustrating for sure but I've learned to work around it.  Has anyone else had this experience?
In	solutions.	In light of posts about EF difficulties. The lab I'm working for suggested I should do a short abstract for a conference coming up.  And the deadline is in. . . less than two months. They suggested an easy enough topic, mainly an exploratory analysis.  Instead of just running in blind, I'll need to spend some time reading (bad at doing, bad at scheduling. . . ).  After, do analyses to see if we find anything worthwhile.  After, write up the short abstract.  Submit. So. . . in light of the fact that I (A) still have job duties, (B) have a separate thesis I want to get published by October, and (C) don't have much time to begin with, what do you suppise might be a good game plan? (talking about it's easier than doing it. . . )I'm thinking: spend 2 weeks prioritizing reading.  Conflicts with my want to read up on a certain topic more (which I. . . wasn't doing to begin with!).  Spend 2 weeks working on analyses.  Spend 2 weeks writing it up.  Last 2 weeks on editing, reading to fill in certain blanks.  That's it.  Sound doable?What are things I can do to make those two week intervals more productive? Preferably simple-but-intuitive solutions. 
Idk	aspergers	Idk was just curious if it were different to them or anything and was just wondering the differences between male and female aspergers
he believes I have Aspergers	I'm already an outcast and really depressed	So I'm 14 years old, about a week ago I had a phone consultation with a psychologist.  He has since sent my mum a letter saying  <e1> he believes I have Aspergers </e1> .  (I'm not diagnosed just yet and I'm not asking for one just to clarify).   <e2> I'm already an outcast and really depressed </e2>  so I was wondering if Aspergers is related to depression or anxiety? All I know it it's a type of autism.  Thank you
Do	things.	Do you ever feel this way?I find myself feeling like this a lot.  Like somehow I’m just making a big deal of certain things. 
I	me.	I want nothing more than to have good friends and feel connection but for some reason I can't trace back, I have this very deep feeling of isolation that I can't shake.  Like I'm wandering a glass maze trying to get people's attention but they can't hear me. There's been a few instances in my life where people have been together having fun and it would have been as easy as a walk down the stairs to join them, but instead I decided to sit by myself and not do what I wanted. I don't lack confidence and have no problem joining in with people if there's an aim, some direct reason to be there, but anything spontaneous feels irregular. I'm confident in saying I wasn't socialised but I can never know that for sure. Do any of you feel the same way? I can't even seem to say hi to people at work and everyone else talks to one another and I can barely ask for someone's name.  So I just get stares instead and I just hope they don't think anything bad about me. 
I’m leaving from LAX and have a 7 hour layover in London (Heathrow airport)	I’m kinda freaking out about it	On Friday I’m flying to Israel for a 2 month internship program I’m doing.   I’m super excited but I’m so nervous about navigating the airport and getting panicked.    <e1> I’m leaving from LAX and have a 7 hour layover in London (Heathrow airport) </e1>  and  <e2> I’m kinda freaking out about it </e2> .   I asked my dad to go through LAX with me up to security but after that I’m on my own.   How do I ensure that I don’t get confused and then have a complete melt down?
I was doing something my Mom didn’t like	she would get really mad	When I was a kid and  <e1> I was doing something my Mom didn’t like </e1>  such as certain movements or if I was doing something she considered weird  <e2> she would get really mad </e2>  and would yell “if you keep doing that I’ll send you right to a special school!” When I asked my mom why she did this she just said “well it worked didn’t it?” Is it normal for parents to be like this with their kids on the spectrum when they are younger? I’m 25 now and just finished law school and I’m about to take the bar exam.  I feel like some of this may have impacted my self-esteem growing up. 
I've	stress?	I've been in a relationship with my ASD girlfriend and when she's overloaded or overwhelmed I guess I try to calm her down by reassurance or telling the truth and not seeming stressed when she's stress but she takes it as me being nonchalant or that I'm trying stress her out more.  How can I distress her without causing more stress?
I don't make good decisions when under stress and it can really irritate other people	I'm just worrying excessively	Seminars on this cost money and were wondering if the community could come together and provide strategies they were taught or from experience that has helped to identify stressors in the workplace and management of sensory problems. For example, in my case, I can get really anxious when stressed.   <e1> I don't make good decisions when under stress and it can really irritate other people </e1>  because  <e2> I'm just worrying excessively </e2>  and I should just calm the crap down.  I may blank out, can't think of ideas.  At the moment, I'm struggling to find management for this. 
I keep canceling plans	I have no idea how to socialize anymore	I know that plenty of autistic people have expressed this same fear, but  <e1> I keep canceling plans </e1> , because  <e2> I have no idea how to socialize anymore </e2> .  I am even too anxious to hang out with my parents most times.  I’ve spent the vast majority of the last six months alone in my room.  How do I learn to feel comfortable leaving my safe space?
Have	situation.	Have you ever noticed this? Especially people who work/have worked with autistic children.  It's like they are unnerved about being confronted with the fact that there are autistic adults out there living their lives - that they don't just disappear from reality or end up locked up in care facilities and group homes for their own good. Bonus points if:It's after they said something derogatory about autistic or disabled people (including in some cases them trotting out the R-word). You criticize how educators and other responsible adults treat autistic children. You bring up examples of abuse you experienced as a result of your disability status.  In many circumstances it's obvious that people in that position are perpetuating the same thing and are disturbed that they have been called on it. Has anyone here experienced this?Edit: I should clarify I mean when you meet people in that position outside of a professional situation. 
Plus I cant really keep a job long without getting so fking bored	I quit	Does anyone else have 'analysis paralysis' to the extreme?  I have a bacherlors degree but cant find a job in my field (environmental) so sometimes think about going back to school, but how would I decide between physician assistant, or physical therapy, something completely different like IT?  I don't 'love' any job.    <e1> Plus I cant really keep a job long without getting so fking bored </e1>   <e2> I quit </e2> .   Computers seem good, but around my area without a security clearance I seem screwed. 
The	Thanks!	The way i understand it is that Aspies are bad at recognize and practicing social cues naturally, but many of the people on this sub speak of how introverted they are. for context im a teenager, i really enjoy talking to people and having meaningful conversations, that being said i dont have 1 friend group and tend to float around a lot, speaking to a bunch of different people but never fully trusting or comfortable around 1 person.  i can be very ignorant in certain ways and extremely blunt.  I struggle with dealing with any severity of injustices, especially and become annoyed, irritated and angry easilyim not asking for a diagnosis of any sort but i was just wondering if anyone else (preferably diagnosed) relates to my situation.  Thanks!
I don’t really feel an emotional connection with them	me not relating to the	I’ve felt pretty lonely for a while now.  I have a few decent friends, but  <e1> I don’t really feel an emotional connection with them </e1> .  I think it’s partly due to  <e2> me not relating to the </e2> m.  I personally feel like I relate to anyone, though I know that’s not true. I genuinely don’t feel anything when it comes to socializing anymore.  I don’t even experience any good feelings from hugs/talking/etc from friends or family.  When you feel like this, you feel empty even if you are surrounded by good people.  I can’t seem to perceive what it’s like to feel connected anymore. I’m getting tired of this now and just want to feel something from my interactions.  I don’t know why I feel this way, because I used to feel normal.  I just wish now that I could somehow force myself to experience connection again. 
frustrating to me	not being able to follow a story that I was incredibly excited to get invested in	I don’t know if this is a problem caused by my autism or if I’m just forgetful in spite of it, but I figured that this was a good place to post about this issue and seek feedback. I’ve had a fairly poor memory for a long time.  It’s far from crippling, but I do have difficulties remembering certain things and paying attention.  Sometimes, I’ll miss important details about upcoming classes and events at school despite seemingly everyone else knowing about them.  I can never seem to remember the contents and plots of most of the books that I read, even if I literally just finished reading a chapter.  Occasionally, I also just forget things that happened to me moments prior.  I could’ve said or done something moments earlier and it would’ve completely slipped my mind. Like I mentioned earlier, this isn’t an issue that leaves me needing additional support from others, but it’s very annoying regardless.  I especially hate how it interferes with my reading.  There are very few things that are more  <e1> frustrating to me </e1>  than  <e2> not being able to follow a story that I was incredibly excited to get invested in </e2> . 
I'm	icky	I'm not sure if I'm wrong in feeling this way, but something about non-autistic people adopting (and shifting the definition) of certain words just. . . .  rubs me the wrong way. Neurodivergent has come to include ADHD, depression, GAD, and other disorders.  I'm not sure why that bothers me so much. I also have begun hearing people use masking in similar ways (basically turning it into any time someone tries to act 'normal', not just specifically autistic masking)im curious what everyone's thoughts are on this. idk if I'm being a gatekeeping jerk but it kinda feels like part of our culture is being stolen and it makes me feel really icky
Today	asked.	Today one of my friends asked Google some sarcastic questions and it didn't know that they were sarcastic and just said an answer that would be the asnwer if it wasn't sarcastic.  It has knowledge of all kinds.  He also said that it is dumb therefore after he said it I asked him you do know that Google is litarly like me.  And so this post was created.  Unfortunately I am not an AI nor am I as intelligent as the AI nor do I unfortunately not know as much as the AI.  No sarcasm except of the sarcastic question he asked. 
So,	again.	So, probably like all of you, I’ve not had the easiest time in school or work.  Pre-diagnosis I’d called it bullying but now I guess it’s discrimination… it’s happened again in this job and I get to go through the struggle of finding another job and everything involved with changing routine, meeting new people and working in a new space.  I just hate it and I’m feeling really sad because I shouldn’t have to go through this again. 
I forced my self to look up when I was walking when I was 10	my parents said that it was dangerous to not be looking at your surroundings and made me stop	Normally people have their heads up when they walk, but I used to walk by staring straight at the ground and looking at the floor/my feet.  Eventually  <e1> I forced my self to look up when I was walking when I was 10 </e1>  because  <e2> my parents said that it was dangerous to not be looking at your surroundings and made me stop </e2> .  It wasn't because of anxiety either, I wasnt scared or ashamed or anything, I just walked by keeping my head down and eyes to the floor.  Its a wonder I didnt get into more accidents and bump into more people.  Anyone else do this? Any reason why we might have done this?
He appreciated my beating him to it	this is my system too	At the supermarket checkout yesterday, the cashier and I got in an enthusiastic, eye contact free conversation on the proper sorting and bagging of groceries.   He held forth on his system of quickly organizing things on the conveyor belt so that cold things end up together, produce ends up together, things like eggs and bananas end up on the top of the bag, etc.   That way even if the customer or bagger doesn't care about doing it right it still ends up at least halfway right.    <e1> He appreciated my beating him to it </e1> , since  <e2> this is my system too </e2> .   And I was just like RIGHT ON MAN.   Fellow Aspie spotted in the wild, actual enjoyable interaction. 
I	like.	I can't help but be amused at all the people going out of their minds from solitude, but this has always been my life.  I somehow feel like only now they might understand what true social isolation feels like. 
I know what it's like not to be treated with kindness or compassion	those are two qualities I value heavily	Is anyone else strongly morally oriented and repelled by injustice in a way that you think might be associated with ASD? I've always found society to be alarmingly apathetic about social justice and even basic decency to others.  I hate apathy, wilful ignorance, unfairness, duplicity, manipulation, dishonesty (within reason), and most of all, intentional cruelty.  I'm sure a lot of this is tied to the endless abuse I've experienced in every decade of my life.   <e1> I know what it's like not to be treated with kindness or compassion </e1> , so  <e2> those are two qualities I value heavily </e2> .  NT society is often casually accepting of behaviour that I find abhorrent.  I just don't like bullshit.  Can anyone else relate?
I display a symptom	she gets mad at me	I (22F) am currently trying to get diagnosed and my first appointment will be on the 10th.  Ever since I told her about it, she keeps telling me I'm not Autistic because they would have noticed it earlier and I'm just high potential, not autistic and If you want to go through the diagnosis proccess, it's your choice but I think you're wrong.  Yet, every time  <e1> I display a symptom </e1> ,  <e2> she gets mad at me </e2> .  Even worse, she thinks I'm acting autistic on purpose. 
he was afraid I could reject him	I confessed too	Well guys, I did it.  I managed to talk to the boy I've had crush on.  He was a friend of one of my friends, so I thought I can be friends with him for now.  We talked for a while, then we became good friends, but it didn't take long as I imagined.  Last night, he said he has a crush on me, but  <e1> he was afraid I could reject him </e1> , so  <e2> I confessed too </e2> . I don't know how I will be in this relationship, but for now, I feel like all the world is harmonized around me and him! I hope every one of you find love!
So much that I detract from my own health	it's so exhausting	I have spent a significant majority of my energy trying to understand, please, care for, and communicate with other people.  <e1> So much that I detract from my own health </e1>  because  <e2> it's so exhausting </e2> . Yet time and time again I still fail and get called selfish or self-centered. I'm not those things, and being called them really drives in that I am just bad at being a person. edit: I'd like to thank everyone for your responses.  There are too many to reply to given my low state of energy, but everyone's words are kind and appreciated in their own ways.  :)
it makes me really sad	remember how much I’ve forgotten them	Well not that extreme as right when they leave a room, but the more time and space that separates people, the more quickly I forget them.  This goes for everyone, even childhood friends and family.  Sometimes I see eg a post from them, or maybe pass them on the street, and  <e1> it makes me really sad </e1>  to  <e2> remember how much I’ve forgotten them </e2> . Like, the namecard brings up a file, but the file is dusty and hasn’t changed since last meeting.  Just hurts is allEdit to add: I literally completely forgot about this post and though saw your replies pop up just totally didn't even register as real so thanks for commenting sorry I haven't continued conversations or whatever we're supposed to do on reddit
If	:')	If I KNEW how to do it or it I wouldn't be ASKING, would I?Edit: Just wanna say this post was from a situation where I was definitely in the wrong, but nonetheless everyone involved said this same bullshit.  I'm glad you all understand :')
I'm burning at both ends over	I'm passionate about and collapsing into a depressed barely functional mess	In a new memoir, activist Greta Thunberg recounted spending her middle school years spiraling into a depressed stupor, with her passion on climate change ultimately being the only thing that shook her out of it.  I think it should sound familiar to a lot of us.  huffpost. com/entry/greta-thunberg-climate-change-memoir-malena-ernman_n_5e702de2c5b63c3b6483704fI can certainly relate.  I'm pretty much always going through periods where  <e1> I'm burning at both ends over </e1>  something  <e2> I'm passionate about and collapsing into a depressed barely functional mess </e2> .  Autistic burnout is a bitch
Am	it?	Am I the only one that listens to the same row of songs from my playlist over and over again until I added new songs to do that with? Do you also struggle with taking compliments and reacting to them in a normal manner? Do you also feel awkward about people touching your arm or so, in a friendly manner? Do you also sometimes immerge yourself into a topic for hours on end, maybe even for days and then just drop it and never go back to it?
They are living normal lives	want their diagnosis to be understood better	Rather than actually sitting down and listening to autistic people, most people use us as props to feel good about themselves.  Look at me! I have a blue ribbon! Let me take a selfie with my autistic brother who doesn’t want his picture taken for likes! People won’t accept that autism speaks is garbage.  People only see autism either as the good doctor or someone who will be help their entire life.  Newsflash people: there are plenty of autistic people that you wouldn’t even guess have it!  <e1> They are living normal lives </e1>  and just  <e2> want their diagnosis to be understood better </e2> .  I don’t want to be called an “angel” or “gods gift” I want to be an actual human in your eyes.  Okay rant over. 
The	me.	The stereotype is aspies talking for hours about obscure interests, but I'm the opposite.  idk why I've always been like this, but I freeze up or answer something really vague and generic when asked what I'm interested in, what I do with my time, even stuff like what games or music I'm into.  I think I'm terrified of being judged, and I guess on some level I'm ashamed of myself and feel like a pathetic boring person.  I find it super humiliating if I say something and people have a wtf type reaction, which I feel has happened loads, and those things stick with me. 
At	hints?	At least to me (22f) this seems to happen relatively often (which is interesting since I keep hearing that guys don't get hints but apparently they very much do!).  I'll be having what feels like a very normal conversation, and something I say is interpreted as having some sort of subtext that I didn't intend. Perhaps my most obvious one was when chatting with a guy and I casually mentioned something about being able to fit a lot in my mouth, I think I referenced a burrito I recently had. . .  I wholeheartedly only meant it as lol I could wrap my whole mouth around this burrito isn't that funny? so when he, some weeks later, went very full-force with the flirtation I was extremely confused as to how he could think that was appropriate! He specifically pointed to this interaction as an example of why he thought I was into him.  Oops. Do you have any anecdotes of accidentally flirting/dropping hints?
I'm	share.	I'm getting a PhD in steroid biochemistry and recently passed my qualifying exam with ease.  All of my examiners said they were very impressed with my knowledge on the topic.  It's just a proud moment I wanted to share. 
This	else?	This might sound really petty or silly, but when things change in my house I get really annoyed and I feel weird for the rest of the day.  Like today my parents moved my router (I bought an expensive one with QoS settings so I could play games when they were watching Netflix) around to another spot and I got really upset and moved it back and told them to leave it there.  Even though it's been moved back to where it was I still feel like something isn't right and the rest of my day is going to be ruined now. Everything needs to have its place and it stays there once it does.  Unless I PERSONALLY decide it needs to be moved, which agrees with my aspergers.  I can't wait to get my own place -. -Does this happen to anyone else?
I'm	situation.	I'm sick of trying to explain why I do the things I do to neurotypicals who will never understand. EDIT: it's interesting to see all of the different opinions! Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the discussion, but I kinda meant teachers and general managers, haha :) My teachers don't seem to understand why I miss deadlines or just never start assignments, and managers don't get why I can't do certain things for them.  I guess general understanding is what I wish we had more of.  If they were autistic as well, they'd be more likely to understand the situation. 
This social distancing makes me more anxious	it makes me see just how unusual and socially disconnected I am	This whole Covid-19 social distancing thing has made me realize just how abnormal I am.   Life for me consists of not bonding with others and doing everything alone.   I’m typically a homebody that just goes out a few days a week to run essential errands like going to the store to get food, gas, etc.  <e1> This social distancing makes me more anxious </e1>  because  <e2> it makes me see just how unusual and socially disconnected I am </e2> .    Strangely, it makes me even more afraid to go out.    Normal people are going to go back to normal life once this is over with.   Life will resume for everyone while I will continue watching from the outside.   I will remain the same. 
But	memberships.	But it's not a bad puke, I'm just super excited and happy and nervous and a bunch of other crazy feelings because. . . I just got my first job!!I'm going to be working at the zoo where I volunteer, and I put in the application about 2 weeks ago, got the interview notice last week, and had the interview today! On the bus ride home, they called me back and offered the job!Now if only I can keep from freaking out in public while I'm trying to get home.  I am, quite literally, shaking!*EditThanks for all the kind words! All this was started by signing up to volunteer about 2 years ago, getting approved to volunteer last year, and working my butt off to put my name out there!I would definitely reccomend signing up to volunteer first before putting in an application.  My zoo gave us benefits like free access to the zoo during open hours, discounts on all the shops and food, and discounts on memberships. 
I can always feel the burnout coming	I get more and more stressed and tired and then one day I just wake up and feel nothing	Hi all.  I recently noticed a pattern in myself and I'm wondering if it's ASD or just me being weird. Basically, whenever I have a burnout (which happens at least once a year because my work is very demanding) and my body and mind get overstressed, my brain just kind of. . . turns off my emotions.   <e1> I can always feel the burnout coming </e1>  because  <e2> I get more and more stressed and tired and then one day I just wake up and feel nothing </e2> .  It's like there's a void where my emotions should be.  I know what I would normally feel in certain situations (anxiety/happiness/excitement. . . ), but the emotions are just. . . absent. This is not depression btw.  I've had several depressive episodes before and this feels different.  I still function, and I actually don't feel too bad (as opposed to depression which is an endless spiral of misery and darkness).  I'm just. . . not fully there, if that makes sense. I think it's my brain's way of trying to cope and protect me when things become to much.  Sometimes it lasts days, sometimes weeks, but eventually the emotions always gradually come back. Does anyone else experience this?
Our clients tend to look for people who have personality and it doesn’t sound like you’re enthusiastic	I got pissed and I said, “I don’t want to work with you” and just hung up	I’ve been looking for another job recently.   A recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn and wanted to set up a time to talk on the phone about some opportunities.   When we were talking on the phone, she started laughing and said “ <e1> Our clients tend to look for people who have personality and it doesn’t sound like you’re enthusiastic </e1> ”.    <e2> I got pissed and I said, “I don’t want to work with you” and just hung up </e2> .   I can’t help that I’m monotone.   I’ve tried changing my voice pitches and recording myself, but it doesn’t work out the way that it should.   I’m curious as to what you all do to try not to sound monotone?
I	else?	I can't help it, but I always end up cringing at everything I've done.  Even though I feel like it wouldn't necessarily be cringy if someone else did it, but I just feel like I'm the cringiest person on the planet.  Now that we have lessons online we have to answer questions for this class and return them to the teacher (and the subject is my special interest, which makes it even worse) and I always think that my answers are suuper cringy and that the teacher is like always cringing when reading my answers.  Maybe it's just low self-esteem? Anyone else?
I	this?	I occasionally find myself spilling my drink down my chin (sometimes daily) while drinking from a cup, I’m unsure if this is autism-related or not, but I read that neurodivergent children can have trouble with drinking from cups, and are often messy drinkers.  However, I’m 18 lol.  Does anyone else tend to do this?
I see a group people doing the wrong thing or something stupid just because of an influence	I get really annoyed and disappointed	For me, whenever  <e1> I see a group people doing the wrong thing or something stupid just because of an influence </e1>  (i. e.  the Media, social media stars)  <e2> I get really annoyed and disappointed </e2> .  Some examples would be: watching people eat Tide Pods or stick a penny in an exposed outlet, hearing people call it quarantine when it's lockdown, hearing people call it the screen when it's the display, stuff like that.  Anyone else?
My	off'?	My mind is constantly on and i'm not sure why? Everytime i'm doing something (video games, work, talking) you name it.  I will wonder about anything, never be absorbed in one single thing.  I love movies however I don't like watching them, I wander when watching, constantly refer things to myself, just never be indulged. This works for video games too, i play cold war zombies a lot and i'm never in the game fully.  I always think what my team mates are doing, what else i could be doing irl, what i need to do irl etc.  Does anyone else have this thinking process?Might be worth a mention that i struggle to sleep quite a lot but struggle to wake up too.  I can never get/see out of one frame of mind.  If i'm tired, I'm tired I NEED SLEEEP. EDIT:Nice to see a lot of people are feeling similar and know exactly what is happening.  How does everyone calm those thoughts, zone out or just 'turn off'?
I	too	I had that idea when talking to my bf (who haves aspergers) about how it was very challenging for him to get social norms and body language as he grew up.  I mentioned it to him and he said something like that would have helped him a lot. I tought about making videos with myself (I'm neurotypical) acting out certain body language examples, highligthing and explaining them; also explaining social norms and discouraged behaviours (like not shaving outdoors, not farting, talking too loudly or for too long, things like that).  What do you think? Related advice or ideas are appreciated too
I’ll	”	I’ll remember an event or whenever my family would go somewhere or do something, and I remember certain things about it to basically really “small details. ”
I’m unable to use that empathy to comfort that person or convey my caring for them	I end up coming off as apathetic	I, for one, feel like I experience empathy very strongly.  When someone cries or is embarrassed, it’s like I feel the same way, only no body knows because  <e1> I’m unable to use that empathy to comfort that person or convey my caring for them </e1> .   <e2> I end up coming off as apathetic </e2>  even though I care about that person very much. 
I can only to be permanently tagged as a terrible person by someone	a misstep sometimes	Even when I get what I said or did wrong and apologize for it some people start to loathe me so much it doesn't even matter what I say anymore.  It's tiring to stay alert to as many social signals as  <e1> I can only to be permanently tagged as a terrible person by someone </e1>  for  <e2> a misstep sometimes </e2> . 
I	?	I spoke to others in real life about my struggles and I was met with.  Oh yea of course.  I knew you were along time ago you aren't already diagnosed? Really? You're just finding out? ? I don't know if they are being sarcastic or if they are really shocked I didn't know.  But so far everyone has been supportive.  Actually very not surprised at all.  Why am I the only one surprised? ?
my brain just can't tolerate being outside of this numb comfort	watching a different tv show just makes me feel weird	I'm so used to my numb routine 16 hours a day, lying in bed just rewatching the same sitcoms, browsing reddit and youtube.  It's comfortable, it's the truest form of escapism.  Weeks, months, years have flown by, just numb and comfy. But after many years of this, I guess  <e1> my brain just can't tolerate being outside of this numb comfort </e1> .  Even so much as  <e2> watching a different tv show just makes me feel weird </e2> , almost manic.  Anxious as hell.  Almost like existential dread, I feel very uncomfortable.  Almost getting panic attacks, not really though. Same shit happens if I do anything new really.  Or if I contemplate the past, even just listening to songs I used to listen.  Shit, I repress 99% of any memory I've had, I hate thinking about the past.  Anyway, new songs, new sites, new anything.  If I don't just rot in bed watching the same sitcoms, playing the same games, browsing the same sites, then I'm fucking anxious as hell, stressed. Shit, wageslaving is going to suck so, so fucking bad for me.  It'll be a million times worse than anything. 
feeling extremely overwhelmed	annoyance, fear or even sadness	Not sure if it is an Asperger’s or Autism thing but I strongly dislike watching? I like watching documentaries or vlogs but dislike most fictions although I love some of them like Harry Potter.  I get too carried away with the emotions and end up  <e1> feeling extremely overwhelmed </e1>  with  <e2> annoyance, fear or even sadness </e2>  depending on what the movie or a particular scene is. Apparently it’s called hyper-empathy but also wondering if any of you all feel the same about watching
Hi	center.	Hi everyone,MY first post here.  I recently found out that I may be on the spectrum.  In the weeks after that I tried to process it on my own which was emotionally draining.  Due to this I recently broke down emotionally at work and my female coworker was kind enough to listen to me, but at that time I couldn't fully explain into detail what really bothered me. In the meanwhile I have also talked to my doctor about my suspicion that I may be on the spectrum and suggested that I should maybe tell my female coworker so that my situation at work could also be a bit better.  Right now I feel a bit alone at work. Is it a good idea to tell about this to my coworker even tough I'm not sure yet that I am on the spectrum? I don't have any friends with who I can talk.  And it will also take a month before I could start with my consultations in a specialized center. 
Ahoy-hoy,Does	longer.	Ahoy-hoy,Does anyone have any helpful suggestions, advice and/or resources for meltdown hangover cures?By hangover, I mean that I become incredibly tired and drained when I come down after a meltdown.  Essentially making the rest of the day a write off - this, to me, is as bad as the meltdown itself but lasts for hours longer. 
I get bullied at work and school a lot by people who pick up on my weaknesses and make fun of them	They know that I have difficulties under certain circumstances and take full advantage of them	I’m not sure if that makes sense.  What I mean is that everyone knows a lot about me somehow, especially people who shouldn’t know things, and can “read” me.   <e1> I get bullied at work and school a lot by people who pick up on my weaknesses and make fun of them </e1> .   <e2> They know that I have difficulties under certain circumstances and take full advantage of them </e2> .  They can tell all my emotions, desires, fears, even better than I can at times. 
I'm about to open a channel on YouTube and I usually look away from the camera	I feel uncomfortable	 <e1> I'm about to open a channel on YouTube and I usually look away from the camera </e1>  because  <e2> I feel uncomfortable </e2> 
get mad	I put on earphone and listen to metal and they don't understand why their music bothers me so much but mine which is louder doesn't	Basically loud noises like vacuum cleaner, washing machine and tools.  Plus loud music really really distress me.  But other sounds like bangs, vehicles and metal music don't.  That leads to weird situations where my family plays loud music in my car and I tell them it really bothers me, they then  <e1> get mad </e1>  when  <e2> I put on earphone and listen to metal and they don't understand why their music bothers me so much but mine which is louder doesn't </e2> . Any ideas on how can I explain it to them? Also worth noting that my mom and dad know about my diagnosis but as far as I know my siblings don't and I prefer to keep it that way. 
I've aced probably every single test	I've never had to worry about being nervous before some big algebra quiz or stuff like that	By good, I'm talking about in comparison to your normal classwork grades. I've always been a B/C student for pretty much my entire life, but  <e1> I've aced probably every single test </e1> .   <e2> I've never had to worry about being nervous before some big algebra quiz or stuff like that </e2> .  On state tests, I consistently scored at or above the 95th percentile.  In fact, I was even invited to take the ACT/SAT back in 7th grade as part of some program for gifted children. Yet, despite this, I SUCK at normal stuff.  Daily activities, reviews, worksheets, stuff like that.  It just doesn't come easy to me.  My grades were riddled with missing assignments, too. Is there any connection to this and ASD? Could it be a sensory thing, with stuff like a loud classroom vs a quiet testing hall? I'm kind of in a rush, so that's why this post might seem weirdly worded. 
So	sto-	So when I was in my teens and early 20s I loved writing.  I like the idea of entertaining someone with my sense of humour or action set piece or whatever.  Flash forward a mere 10 years later and now I’d rather fist fight a train than sit down and write.  I play Holdfast non stop and waste time on the internets, like moaning like I am rn than actually doing the work, and there’s the rub. It shouldn’t feel like work.  I think my brain releases stress than dopamine.  Or I’ve fallen for the same social media trap as hundreds of millions of people who want instant gratification over long term fruit.  Or maybe I’m just too old.  Or maybe I should be quiet and sto-
I'm torn	I've always felt that Aspie/Aspberger's describes me to a tee, much more than ASD-1	I learned, just recently, about the history of Dr.  Aspberger.  I knew that the term had been dropped from the DSM-V but didn't also know that, essentially, Aspberger was a likely Nazi.   <e1> I'm torn </e1>  because  <e2> I've always felt that Aspie/Aspberger's describes me to a tee, much more than ASD-1 </e2> .  Clearly this sub is not named ASD.  How do other people feel about this? Can/should we still use terms like Aspie? Does anyone else feel disconnected from ASD or am I just being. . . well, an Aspie about it?
A	something.	A month ago I heard that I might have traits of asperger's and after that I have done a lot of reading, tests and other research.  Now, day by day I become more and more confused about what a neurotypical person is like.  Like what the heck does it mean to be neurotypical at this point?? How do neurotypical people think? I think I need a list of neurotypical traits or something. 
I am completely fine with most if not all non-verbal communication and comprehending people's emotions etc	my mom invalidates me 24/7 and just says I have bad social anxiety and I'm self-conscious and just to get out more is all	Can anyone else understand body language just fine? and can tell when someone isn't enjoying their selves or gets upset etc? I also am very good at making people laugh which requires being able to time jokes.  My main ASD symptoms are I despise eye contact, struggle with small talk, struggle socializing with anyone out of my close friend circle, struggle comforting people and properly expressing my emotions.  But since  <e1> I am completely fine with most if not all non-verbal communication and comprehending people's emotions etc </e1>   <e2> my mom invalidates me 24/7 and just says I have bad social anxiety and I'm self-conscious and just to get out more is all </e2> .  :(
I	glass.	I can’t believe I’m asking this question as someone in my late 30s, but when I get to a certain point of rage, nothing releases it other than physically injuring myself. In the past I have, embarrassingly, hit myself in the head, slammed my hand in a door / drawer, punched / kicked a wall to the point of bruised knuckles (most common). I work in education—I can’t come into work with my knuckles broken. I’ve tried therapy, and when I’m simply angry, strategies work, but there’s a point that I can’t control my anger.   It’s so hard to push down; I feel like I am swallowing my emotions all day long, and it’s like eating glass. 
I feel like neurotypical non autistic people get more emotionally invested	more aggressive, violent and such by stuff like religion/politics/ideologies/etc	 <e1> I feel like neurotypical non autistic people get more emotionally invested </e1>  and as a result also  <e2> more aggressive, violent and such by stuff like religion/politics/ideologies/etc </e2> . For example when people fight about something random like which deity is right or suchIt seems so weird and funnyI understand that they might get caught up in the moment but I do get the cases of people literally assaulting others just because of some disagreeing views or something like that, do neurotypicals in general lead their life more with their reptile brain and emotional instinctual rather than frontal cortex?
Sometimes,	Asperger's?	Sometimes, especially at times of stress, boredom, or loneliness, I slip into pretending I'm someone in a fictional universe.  This isn't like acting like a fictional character, but if I'm on a bus and I've been playing a lot of a certain fantasy game I might imagine I'm my character on a wagon going somewhere in that universe.  I think it's a method of dissociation and coping with boredom or stress.  I should say I'm 23.  Is this typical of Asperger's?
There were specific reasons	I found both of them fascinating	I used to like professional wrestling and fantasy sports.   <e1> There were specific reasons </e1>  for why  <e2> I found both of them fascinating </e2> . Now I find them to be meaningless distractions. So I need to ask you guys and girls.  It is the oldest question in the book, but I’m intrigued what people in this community particularly have to say.  What gives your life meaning? Why are you living on this earth?——-Disclaimer: I’m depressed and am on meds. 
long-distance studying	C-virus	I'm good at functioning in an academic context as long as a) there is structure in place or b) the subject I'm studying interests me.  But now with  <e1> long-distance studying </e1>  due to  <e2> C-virus </e2> , I struggle a lot. Hardest things for me are: getting started, time management, and planning bigger things.  It's very hard for me to decide what to do first and that frequently causes freezing.  Also, I might plan that I study, I even mark it down into my calendar, and then suddenly I realize the whole day is over and I never did anything since I fell into the wormhole of one of my special interests or just plainly did other things and never started at all. I'd love to hear what has worked for you!
Are	judge.	Are you guys getting super anxious about when to say something/make a noise, what type of noise while on the phone to let the person you're talking to know that you are listening to them? Happens to me all the time, as well as not knowing when the person is being serious or making a joke. . .  It's kinda annoying that my response might sometimes be inappropriate and the person might judge. 
nervous	I'm shaking just from a message on discord	All my life I've kinda just worn a mask and fit in.  I joined this sub yesterday, read through, and Finally managed to share with a friend what goes on with me.  He was quite understanding about it.  Was just hard to work up the confidence to do so.  Bout 5 minutes ago I worked up the courage to send a message on discord and finally opened up to someone.  That shall be the start of working on my anti-socialization.  Having someone to help me through it.  And am I supposed to be this  <e1> nervous </e1>  where  <e2> I'm shaking just from a message on discord </e2> ? Imma have to calm myself before leaving my room back to the rest of my household. 
so	this.	so basically, my aspergers makes me sometimes prounounce some letters weird, even though i can say them perfectly right.  for example, i pronounce the letter o as oo, so for context, i play minecraft to calm myself down in an evening, i have a survival world with pet cows, i will greet them by saying helloo coos, does anyone else doo anything like this. 
(please	happen?	(please do not make this post political) I was reading about the massacres that come from the israel/palestine conflict, how many people, including entire families who literally go to sleep knowing they are going to die. Excuse my Aspergers, but I've slowly learnt to aware and hopefully understand most neurotypical behaviour to navigate society.  I cannot, however, understand the justification behind wars/massacres.  I guess I understand that it escalates to where it gets to the point of one country sending people to kill people in another country, but I just can't understand how people would think it's fine to like cross the line where you say it's fine just kill people if they're there. Is this something that NTs understand better? I can't even kill a spider in my house.  I'm not saying NTs are more likely to kill or anything, but I just feel that to get to that point of conflict with a different group over a difference, you're probably more involved in caring about interpersonal relationships.  I don't really know. Tldr: Does anyone here understand how wars happen?
they tried to beat me up	I was making fun of them	DAE have a problem with mimicking accents? I only ever mimic an English accent, I do it subconsciously.  One time I was made aware I was doing it, they were very angry with me but I couldn’t stop and  <e1> they tried to beat me up </e1>  as they thought  <e2> I was making fun of them </e2>  despite trying to tell them I wasn’t doing it deliberately and for the life of me I couldn’t stop it though. 
I find it really hard to hang out one and one	you have to be part of the conversation all the time	 <e1> I find it really hard to hang out one and one </e1> , because  <e2> you have to be part of the conversation all the time </e2> .  It drains energy to think of the best thing to respond to what the other person is saying. But if we are more than two everything gets so much easier.  I can say more things automatically instead of manually, and also be able to shut down for a while. 
I am letting others around me down	I'm at work.  Everything is so jumbled up in my head	So I feel as if  <e1> I am letting others around me down </e1>  while  <e2> I'm at work.  Everything is so jumbled up in my head </e2>  when I'm working and I lose track of time while I'm on certain tasks, which in turn causes me to fall behind and I get in trouble by my supervisor.  The job I'm currently in is the roll of a bakers assistant, I have other physical disabilities that also make me slower at work than the other staff.  I try my best but I just wish I could do things like all the other staff in my workplace can and at the speed they can this is my fourth job in two years, any and all guidance and tips welcome.  I just don't know what to do.  Thanks for reading. 
I try to keep to myself	I think they’re probably “weird” or “awkward”	Okay so, I have a lot of questions  <e1> I try to keep to myself </e1>  because  <e2> I think they’re probably “weird” or “awkward” </e2>  but it’d be nice if there was a place where we could ask these questions and, better yet, get some answers! I’m not talking about questions related to ASD itself, that’s what this sub is for, but questions an only an aspie would think to ask. If it doesn’t already exist, it should and I’m down to make it.  We ask questions normal people just don’t and those questions have unlocked things no one would’ve ever thought possible.  We also could use a hand with functioning in an NT world, like, “how are you supposed to cut your nails?” Apparently you don’t cut at the line of the white part and the pink part.  ???♂?If r/aspergers is this place then ooops but if not would you like such a place to exist? Thanks everyone!
I can even smell the path they took	it lingers in the air	I’ve seen some people mention that they don’t like perfume.  I’ll take this further - I can smell old lady perfume maybe 50 feet away.  Outside.  I am SO repulsed by their stench.  Sorry.  Smell.  I’m fine with all smells, but old lady perfume has a certain smell that makes me utterly repulsed!!! At a distance.  Outside.  In the countryside.   <e1> I can even smell the path they took </e1> , because  <e2> it lingers in the air </e2> ! Now I consider that a superpower!!!
they target autistic people	it just makes me scared to even live my life, express myself, socialize, or even go outside	I know  <e1> they target autistic people </e1> , and  <e2> it just makes me scared to even live my life, express myself, socialize, or even go outside </e2> .  Same with cringe compilations, they seem to prey on people like us.  The internet can be great at times but a nightmare at other times, and this fear makes me wanna just hide away and be miserable forever.  And that's no life to live. 
I	this?	I used to just get a little ticked off whenever someone brushed against me, but it seems to have gotten worse in the past few weeks.  The thing that really sets me off is when they say Oh, excuse me! afterward.  It's usually in a high-pitched tone of voice and FUCK it pisses me off.  I'm able to contain my feelings unless it's around a family member or something, and even thing it just seems like passive-aggression to them.  Either I have to wait for myself to cool down or get it out by punching the shit out of a pillow or something.  I know it's not uncommon for people with ASD to feel uncomfortable with it, but I'm starting to worry that I might endanger myself and others as time goes on. Can anyone relate? How do I de-escalate this?
I	stuff/history/psychology/whatever?.	I am not an aspie but I literally always think of somethingHow can normal people just sit down and not think of space stuff/history/psychology/whatever?. 
I have run out of  ideas at this point	I tried to talk her into doing the projects that pay her salary she would give me 100 rational reasons not to	I have an asperger coworker and she seems to be only interested in doing what she wants to do.  Unfortunately most of the things she is interested or proposed had marginal uses for our projects and every time when I bring it up or tries to challenge it she seems offended and says I am ridiculous.   I have been extremely flexible in the past and gives her a lot of freedoms in terms of working hours and things to work on.    <e1> I have run out of  ideas at this point </e1> .

I’m	this?	I’m leaving for college soon and I can’t bear the idea of it.  I don’t want to leave my mother, family or everything that makes me feel so secure and develop a new routine in an unfamiliar environment.  I’m excited to meet new people; however I’m scared I won’t be able to develop the routines I need to in order to function.  Has anyone else experienced this?
someone else confronts me	realise afterwards (sometimes seconds afterwards) how hurtful they were	Hello all,Sometimes, I remember (either by myself or because  <e1> someone else confronts me </e1> ) doing or saying things and  <e2> realise afterwards (sometimes seconds afterwards) how hurtful they were </e2> . . .  and it seems so obvious why it caused hurt and I have no idea why I did not realise it at the time. Has anyone experienced this? If so, how did you react? I make the mistake of reacting defensively when confronted by the hurt person and find myself stuck trying to explain why I did this hurtful thing which I now know is hurtful but can’t remember why the hell I did it so I try and come up with reasons and it all goes wrong.  If I realise by myself, I feel incredibly guilty and frankly, avoid going anywhere near the topic like a coward because… well what the hell am I going to say?Anyway, thank you in advance for your responses. 
I	problem?	I tend to go completely silent when I’m highly stressed or uncomfortable.  Im then unable to get myself to talk again for hours.  I’m just curious if anyone has the same problem?

can't really count on any help from my mom	she doesn't understand how hard this whole situation is for me	don't know where to start with this post but im in a depressive episode since the beginning of this year.  at first i tried to excuse the mess in my room by saying that im at work a lot and have no time to clean.  i work at a home depot kind of store and in my country they were open during every lockdown up until this one.  been home for almost a month now and my room looks worse and worse every single day.  even looking at the mess gets me overwhelmed to the point of crying.  i have no idea where to start or what to do.  i tried splitting my room into sectors and cleaning one at a time, ended up with a dresser that was clean for maybe three days and now it's even worse than it was before i tried cleaning in that area.  i have loads of built up laundry and garbage laying all over my floor.  i also have zero motivation and no idea what to do.   <e1> can't really count on any help from my mom </e1> , because  <e2> she doesn't understand how hard this whole situation is for me </e2> .  i would appreciate any tips and/or advice.

its the friends and family youve lost	you cant explain why	but depression is much more than that. its the excuses you have to make when you cant make that meeting.  <e1> its the friends and family youve lost </e1>  because  <e2> you cant explain why </e2> . its the opportunities that land in everyone elses lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. its the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. its the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. its your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. its the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. its the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. its the wall that blocked you off from life. 
ive	sad.	ive felt empty for days and just now cried a little.  even though im miserable i was almost happy.  its worse to feel like youre dead than being sad. 
i have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on	i've blinked and ten minutes has gone by	for a while now i feel like i am getting progressively stupid.  information doesn't stick, common sense doesn't kick in and overall i really struggle following conversations and responding correctly.  i'm always lead in bed at night cringing about stupid things i've said, things i should of said, how slowly i've been to react to something and overall how useless i am.  i feel like i'm turning into a sloth.  my body is so heavy and every now and then  <e1> i have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on </e1>  because  <e2> i've blinked and ten minutes has gone by </e2> .  i don't recognise this mess that i've become and i just wanted to know if anyone else gets this and if so how to get out of it? i'm miserable and what's worse i'm frustrating for the people around me and getting a reputation of being slow and overall useless.  help ?
get depressed	you arent grateful for the things that you already have	today i got told that you only  <e1> get depressed </e1>  because  <e2> you arent grateful for the things that you already have </e2> . 
i	continues	i go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive.  i am constantly worried about something going wrong.  lack focus and passion for what i do professionally and have no confidence in anything.  i feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig.  toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues
im just sick and tired of being alone 24/7 and feeling completely hopeless to change it	sad as fuck	go where? i dont like bars.  i dont like to drink too much.  especially if im driving.  where else do people go to socialize?? i dont have friends or even know where to go to make friends. i try every opportunity i get it but i dont get many opportunities because i have no idea where to go socialize.  <e1> im just sick and tired of being alone 24/7 and feeling completely hopeless to change it </e1> .  this makes me  <e2> sad as fuck </e2> .  :/
every	suck.	every now and then i start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything.  i start to have all these ideas about how i will change things around and become a better person etc.  just to find that the morning after i'm as depressed as ever, if not more.  it's like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say psyche! you still suck. 
dying by my own hand	no one will be mad at me	in laying here about to sleep and every night i have the mantra in my head of that i hope i never wake up.  i don't want to kill myself but i'd rather just never wake up again.  that way  <e2> no one will be mad at me </e2>  for  <e1> dying by my own hand </e1> .  that way i can't disappoint anyone anymore. anyone else?
i	rant.	i used to distract myself by watching tv shows to escape from reality but my attention span has gotten so fucking bad i cant even do that anymore.  why cant i just die in my sleep and put an end to this miserable existence.  i doubt anybody is gonna read this but its 3 am and i just needed to rant. 
i	inside	i dont enjoy anything anymore.  i dread waking up and i cant wait to go home to sleep just so i dont have to think anymore.  i use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all i do is work, see my boyfriend, study and maybe see my friends once a week.  my life is so meaningless i feel as if it isint going anywhere and i just feel so empty inside.  i use to enjoy activities i use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever i do i cant enjoy .  i dont know how to get out of this sometimes i can sit for hours just staring at a wall i am so dead inside
yesterday	this.	yesterday a friend told me that.  to be honest, when i am around other people i pretend to be happy as if nothing is wrong since i don't want to bother others with my issues.  i don't really know why i am doing this. 
being able to drink and watch movies in the dark in my room	get home excited	every day i go to work barely doing anything and  <e2> get home excited </e2>  for the thought of  <e1> being able to drink and watch movies in the dark in my room </e1> .   does anyone else feel too drained from daily routines to ever break the cycle?
he didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day	he was exhausted and he only saw one option	he was 18.  i grew up with him and he was like my little brother.  he was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes.  he was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh.  he killed himself.    <e1> he didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day </e1> .   <e2> he was exhausted and he only saw one option </e2>  and now i'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself.  i am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and i can't breathe.  i feel too much while feeling too little.   i have struggled with depression and anxiety for years.  but this.  this is. . . overwhelming.  it is excruciating.  it is numbing.  it is agonizing and yet it is impassive.   i feel everything and i feel nothing.    i don't want to die.  but i don't know how to live. i'm fighting every day.  i'm pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast.  every day is a struggle right now.  but i'm fighting.  keep fighting, friends. 
why	.	why would i, it'd just be another day of people screaming at me and feeling like shit because of everything i cant dothen its 2am again, everything reminds me that im alone in the world and it'll always be like that because who the fuck would be with someone like me?it'd just be another day of me thinking how my life would be if someone loved mei'd finally be so happy. . . i wouldnt be alone anymorei'd finally have someone that loves me. . . just imagine me having someone that does want to talk to me, that wants to spend his life with me too and. . . and we're happy togetherbut on the inside i just know it wont happen. . . i just. . . i know itsometimes i wish i was strong enough to just kill myself, but i cant even do thati wish it stopped hurting. . . 
this is an achievement	we need to reward ourselves	i did it you guys.  i'm so happy to have one small thing.  i don't know how i'll reward myself since i have no money, but i'm definitely going go since  <e1> this is an achievement </e1>  and  <e2> we need to reward ourselves </e2>  when we do good. i  hope all of you who struggle with this know you aren't alone and aren't losers or horrible people or failures go being unable to donut on a daily basis.  i know you're trying and i admire you for it. i love you all.  happy new year!
i'm	stasis.	i'm sure some of you have felt this way.  i'm at work.  i'm fulfilling my obligations.  once i go home, i'm going to take some over-the-counter sleep meds, brush my teeth, wash my face, make sure my cat has food and water and then try to sleep until i have to work tomorrow. i don't feel like i'm harming myself, nor do i have any real desire to kill myself; i simply don't want to be around for a certain amount of time.  like going into stasis. 
i told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and i so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all i got was a tough love talk about how i don't deserve to be depressed	i don't care about these people any more	they didn't care at all.  i got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?. when i struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because you know they just put the parents under a microscope. i'm officially done.   <e2> i don't care about these people any more </e2> .   <e1> i told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and i so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all i got was a tough love talk about how i don't deserve to be depressed </e1> . you are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid. edit: thank you all for the warm and understanding messages, it made me cry.  to those who have parents like mine, i'm so sorry.  thank you so, so much.  i woke up to so many messages, and i read every single one. 
im	too.	im in my mid twenties and i feel all i do is sit around and mope.  this is supposed to be the golden age of peoples lives? ive accepted that i am different than other people who know how to live fully.  but what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be.  it feels like i took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet.  like i am responsible for my sadness and theres nothing i seem to be able to do about itedit: didnt think this would get so much traction.  been going through every response and at least i dont feel this away alone.  thank you so much for sharing.  and thanks for the advice too. 
it feels horrible	i realize my crazy fantasies will never happen	i might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. most of the time i start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something.  sometimes i even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. it's starting to become more and more frequent and i'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head.  then reality comes crashing down and  <e1> it feels horrible </e1>  when  <e2> i realize my crazy fantasies will never happen </e2> . it's just so much better in my mind.  anyone else?
i	work.	i struggled for a fair while, probably years.  the last two months or so ive felt great, however since yesterday ive just seemingly hit rock bottom again, cant see any positivity in anything, cant motivate myself to do basic things.  im trying to tell myself its just a passing blip, however im low key worried im going back to the bad place, anyone have similar situations/experiences?edit: i wrote this and fell asleep shortly afterwards, im blown away by the responses.  im going to read through every comment and try and reply throughout my day at work. 
i	interesting.	i feel like after years of being depressed i've become worse at everything i try to do, i used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me.  when i'm studying i'l forget everything and even when i'm focused on reading i almost feel like i'm just staring at a blank page. no matter what i do i can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more i feel like i'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting. 
i	again	i cant help but feel this envy when i see my friends being happy and im stuck in this loop of self hatred. im happy for them,i truly am but whens it gonna be my time? its been like this for over a year now and i am so sick of having to deal with these feelings on a daily basis.  always thinking about how good things used to be and letting myself be enveloped by nostalgia to the point where im not living in the present anymore and its the only coping mechanism i have.  everyone around me is finding their happiness, evolving as a person except for me and i feel as if ive lost all the things that made me who i was and im just an empty shell of a person i used to be.  i dont have any passions, dont do anything with my life and everytime i try to change it i end up failing miserably.  my life is so dull and boring and so am i and i have no idea of which steps to take in order to regain my confidence and be happy again
i couldn't bare to have my skin in the open	i had to put on full sleeved clothing and pants	i've been struggling with depression and self-hatred for the last six months and although i've had thoughts about how the world wouldn't care if i passed away i never have ever gotten to the point where i wanted to act on these thoughts.  today though, i got really scared of my wrists? i don't know if im just engaging with too much depression content since im reading up on it more but  <e2> i had to put on full sleeved clothing and pants </e2>  because  <e1> i couldn't bare to have my skin in the open </e1> .  i put away all the sharp things too and i tried to distract myself.  it's not that i want to hurt myselfi'm not actively thinking about self-hatred or suicide when i get those violent thoughts.  it's almost like there's a impulse acting as another person that's out of control and wants to hurt me even though i know i literally don't want to.  idk if that makes sense. . .  am i going insane. . .  would appreciate any explanation or advice  im scared <3
try	how.	try to blow some time playing videogames, but it just makes me feel frustrated and angry, very little satisfaction.  i feel overall meaningless, what is the point in living, there just isn't a point.  you are born, and you are alive, and then you die.  that's all there is in life, time you can spend freely with no objectives given. so what happens to people like me, who have no objectives of their own? those who want nothing from life? i want to be put out of my misery sometimes, would make things a hell of a lot easier.  but then i decide i want to live and do things, but can think of nothing to do.  what the hell is my purpose.  what am i to do? i want to feel satisfied with my life.  i don't know how. 
i	pass.	i don't want to die, i don't hate my life.  i'm just scared. i've seen the way i handle pretty much everything in my life, and it seems that no matter how hard i try i can never quite get the handle of things for any substantial period of time.  sort of like a dream, where everything is in my mind, but i have little to no actual control. sometimes i get so anxious about the future that i just feel like i should just quit prematurely while things are sort of ok, before i screw up my life any further.  and yes, i know that life is full of good moments too, but i always feel like i don't really deserve them.  i don't want to die, i just want to stop living, if that makes any sense.  like i wish i could become a mountain or a river spirit or something, that way i can exist and i can just watch other people enjoy their lives and let time pass. 
i talk about my issues on here and get shut down	they apparently dont exist	especially in men.  a local man to me killed himself recently and the radio has adverts for men to talk about their mental health.  its fucking stupid.   <e1> i talk about my issues on here and get shut down </e1>  as  <e2> they apparently dont exist </e2> .  im convinced all these people who advocate for mental health awareness havent had depression for 5 minutes.  ive had it for long periods since i was about 10, people trying to tell me that talking about it helps makes me want to rip my own throat out, they just cant shake the idea that talking doesnt help.  and they think they have a right to know why i cant tell them anyway. 
im proud of myself	being able to clean up and organize	i took a shower for the first time in 6 weeks.   i also cleaned my room today.  this semester really took a toll on me and  <e1> im proud of myself </e1>  for  <e2> being able to clean up and organize </e2>  ??
i feel so fucking guilty	when people talk to me i have so much trouble paying attention like my mind is elsewhere and i have such obsessive thoughts like im just thinking about misery anyone	 <e1> i feel so fucking guilty </e1>  like  <e2> when people talk to me i have so much trouble paying attention like my mind is elsewhere and i have such obsessive thoughts like im just thinking about misery anyone </e2>  else lol its so distracting i just cant with this man
need help	feeling sad and depressed feel down	 <e1> need help </e1>   <e2> feeling sad and depressed feel down </e2> 
not having anything set in stone for oneself is great	they can choose	so i'm not exactly sure if this belongs here but characters in books have it so easy in a way.  they have a clear goal in life, frodo must return the ring, harry must defeat voldemort, in many books characters usually know what their purpose is.  and then when they fulfill this purpose they have their ending.  the book ends and so do the characters.  the world siezes to exists with them fulfilled and happy.  and this is so beautiful.  the act of ending at a right time.  in life i feel like there is something i'm searching for but i don't know what it is or whether i i'll ever find it.  and so i sometimes envy them so much.  and i don't want to die but im not sure what i live for.  or whether people do need to live for something.  we could make an argument that  <e1> not having anything set in stone for oneself is great </e1>  because  <e2> they can choose </e2> , but that's the problem.  what to choose?  i just wanted to get this out. 
im in the process of starting a new job which made me happy	i hate my current one	im sick and tired of the same old bullshit day in and day out.   <e1> im in the process of starting a new job which made me happy </e1>  because  <e2> i hate my current one </e2> , however that joy was stolen by some fuckwads that decided to stir shit up yesterday.  fuck people, fuck covid, and fuck life
i just failed the exam	i want to curl up and die	when i started math 11 this year, i decided i wanted to finally commit to something and do well.  i tried my absolute hardest in class and spent many hours studying at home.  i put so much time and effort into this, thinking i could finally be as good as my friends.  my mom was so proud of how determined i was. well  <e1> i just failed the exam </e1>  and now  <e2> i want to curl up and die </e2> . 
theyve been suicidal in the past and their activity online indicates signs of loneliness	im getting concerned	hi, im looking for advice as a friend of someone with anxiety and depression.  a few weeks ago they said it would be better off if we stopped talking for a while, and we havent spoken since.   <e1> theyve been suicidal in the past and their activity online indicates signs of loneliness </e1> , so  <e2> im getting concerned </e2> . i want to reach out and initiate some sort of conversation, but im not sure how to go about it or if that would be disrespecting any boundaries.  when you push someone away, would you prefer them to reach out after a while or continue to give you space? thanks for any help. 
im really lonely lately	ive been trying to date but the only girls that ask me out are poly	 <e1> im really lonely lately </e1> .   <e2> ive been trying to date but the only girls that ask me out are poly </e2> , and i cant do that.  (please dont try to convince me to, it makes me wanna die) all the monogamous girls i meet wanna stay friends. i feel isolated and like im not good enough for anyone. 
why	.	why oh why did this horrible f*cking curse had to crush me every single day of my sad excuse for existence. . . 
im	?	im finding that i am distancing myself from family.   if i invite them to my house they either give a last minute excuse or other just havent stayed in touch.  i had covid and one particular cousin didnt even ask me who i was in the 12 weeks i was bed bound. then ill ill find that family will come and visit family that live near me but wont pop in to mine. im now feeling just distancing my self from them is making me feel its the right thing to do.   i keep telling myself if you dont see people you cant fall out with them. am i depressed or normal and this is exactly how these people should be dealt with ?
even in death theres no freedom	theres no self left over to experience it	i didnt choose to be born.  i have a tremendous need for freedom, but i dont believe there is such a thing. to me, you can never truly be free.  you have to make choices within the realm of reality that you exist in; within the laws and beliefs of your land; within the expectations of those who love and care about you.   <e1> even in death theres no freedom </e1>  because  <e2> theres no self left over to experience it </e2> . nothing that i truly desire is possible.  detaching myself from life will only make me empty and sterile.  further attaching myself to life will lead to terrible mental anguish.  i dont have the mental clarity for suicide. i feel uncomfortable everywhere.  i feel distant from everyone.  every conversation, every thought, every feeling only touches me on the surface but never in my core. nothing really feels real or worth experiencing. 
if you dont like to be called, please just hang up	if you say something rude i will do the same	i dont know how ive became such a bitter person but i havent taken a picture of myself in years.  in 2017 i at least looked decent but now i look and feel terrible.  i avoid social media, my family, and im going to quit my job to avoid having to talk to people who dont even care about what im talking about in the first place(cold calling).  if one other person says something rude to me when im just doing my job i think i may literally scream and break down.   <e1> if you dont like to be called, please just hang up </e1>  because  <e2> if you say something rude i will do the same </e2> .  i dont know how ive dug myself into this hole but i suspect my job has made my depression 100 times worse.  i hate myself so much that i would do anything to change everything about myself. 
feel a very heavy chest tightness and shortness of breath	im afraid right now	good evening everyone ,since wendsday may 5 i reduce paroxetine dose of 20mg daily and diazepam 5mg in the morning and 5mg in the evening to 20mg paroxetine every other day and 5mg of diazepam in the evening . is it normal to me to  <e1> feel a very heavy chest tightness and shortness of breath </e1>  ? because  <e2> im afraid right now </e2>  .  thanks everyone for yours answers . 
my mother told me to stop being depressed	if i continue being like that, i will end up like my aunt (she has chronic depression too) whose face has become swollen from the medication	so, today  <e1> my mother told me to stop being depressed </e1>  because  <e2> if i continue being like that, i will end up like my aunt (she has chronic depression too) whose face has become swollen from the medication </e2> . also, i do not diagnose myself, i am 21 years old, i used to go to a psychiatrist for years and i also used to take antidepressants (prozac / ladose) but the therapy didn't help me at all and neither did the medication, so i guess i can't just stop being depressed mom
i	again.	i feel like when everything is okay it's great but lately i'm back to one issue after another.  it seems like when my relationship is okay the rest of my life is fine.  i want to go to therapy but i'm very tired of people saying you don't need it or my parents asking if it's because of them.  today, after a short message, followed by a fight from my significant other of 6 years, i'm afraid i'm on a decline again. 
i have to force myself out of bed each morning, on the days where i even can get out of bed	i can go to work	 <e1> i have to force myself out of bed each morning, on the days where i even can get out of bed </e1> , just so  <e2> i can go to work </e2> .  at work i use up all of my energy masking and pretending to be happy and normal.  a busy little worker bee, full of sunshine.  i always check the clock, as if i can force the time to go faster.  i just want to be home, i just want to be home, i just want to be home.  then finally, i am.  and its such a relief to not have to be happy, happy, happy and to just sit.  and i sit and i stare at the wall, maybe stare at my phone or a game or a movie.  and then its over and its time to go to bed.  and it all starts over again.   my bones ache.  if i could just rest enough, i think, i could go do all the things i want to do.  but i never can get enough, it seems.  its never ending. 
theyre lies	none of it matters anymore everyone should die all life is bs and lies so free yourself if you can	were all dead anyway.  it makes no difference what happens well all be dead and forgotten.  im already there, im free.  theres no meaning to any of the suffering it just fucking happens.  its all meaningless.  the sickness is truth.  fuck your lies fuck me toofuck everyone what if im not depressed? what if i just have chronic boredom? bored of life? of myself? because  <e1> theyre lies </e1> .   <e2> none of it matters anymore everyone should die all life is bs and lies so free yourself if you can </e2> .  ill free them. . . . haha im joking.  i just really dont care anymore im like this bc im too afraid to die.  dont suffer, thats all there is and once you realize it theres no point fighting yourself.  you just end up suffering.  i dont know how long ill be here but i know the only way to end this
im	f26	im constantly battling my brain.  im tired of fighting.  ive been depressed since i was 8.  im tired of nobody caring or wanting or needing me.  i feel like my life is just so pointless.  i dont know how much longer i can keep existing.  i feel like im going to snap.  f26
live the rest of my life drinking seawater and eating fish	therell be no one in the world for me to hurt	dont be a jerk is a very good rule for a depressed person. i mean think about it, whats the point in living if youre depressed and a jerk? you dont make yourself happy, you dont make anyone else happy, all you are is a vortex of suffering.  as a selfish person, youre a failure.  as a selfless person, youre a failure. its such a good rule.  so why do fail so hard? all i do is disappoint people.  let them down.  fail them in every way.  im a jerk, and im depressed. i suppose the only solution is to buy one of those fancy transoceanic kayaks and set sail for the south pacific.  i can  <e1> live the rest of my life drinking seawater and eating fish </e1> .  and  <e2> therell be no one in the world for me to hurt </e2> . 
struggle greatly with is flat affect	i rarely can naturally smile	an issue i  <e1> struggle greatly with is flat affect </e1> .   <e2> i rarely can naturally smile </e2> .  i can think something is funny or sweet but it must be hilarious for me to smile or laugh.  it is very awkward in social situations where i want to express my solidarity (laugh at a joke, react positively to news, etc) but i cannot naturally do so.  i may fake smile but im afraid that i am not very convincing.  it makes me feel very disingenuous.  ill have a feeling on the inside but it is not easy to show naturally on the outside.  is there anything i can do about it? i want to be a smiley person.  i didnt always used to be this way. 
how	?	how do i feel happy again. . .  lately i just feel heavily depressed. . .  this is my 3rd depression hole i dove in to and this one is just screaming for me to end it all ?
i	feel	i feel unwanted everywhere, at home, with school, with friends, even on reddit.  i just got called a bloated n*gger by some internet troll on a recent picture.  i know i have a fat face its been an insecurity since forever and i know its just the internet but ive had such a horrible day and week that comment drove me over the edgei feel so alone, my issues are so trivial in the grand scheme but it doesnt change how hopeless i feel
to off myself when i get a happy relationship for 1 year the end it all even my life	feel that everyone is happy even without me	 <e1> to off myself when i get a happy relationship for 1 year the end it all even my life </e1>  because i  <e2> feel that everyone is happy even without me </e2> ???
hope this is my rock bottom	i dont know how much more i can take this	im recently homeless (usa) and im struggling so hard with my depression.  ive been couch surfing and i wake up every morning physically exhausted.  i feel so discouraged and alone and i dont know what to do.  im trying to be grateful for my physical health and the fact that ive been able to have a roof over my head (so far) but im not sure what tomorrow will bring.  every day i wake up figuring out where im going to sleep at night and im struggling so hard to stay alive.  the only thing thats giving me the slightest bit of hope is praying and what my therapist recently told me youre going to feel worse before you start to feel better.  i  <e1> hope this is my rock bottom </e1>  because  <e2> i dont know how much more i can take this </e2> . 
sometimes	all.	sometimes i feel like i am taking having depression to get away from college work and responsibilities.  i do have everything needed for a good life and my parents tell me that i have nothing to be sad about.  i wonder if this is just my imagination to get away from it all. 
i	baby	i find it truly baffling to think how ancient people were able to pass time with not so much entertainment as we have today?? we have so many outlets today to entertain and distract ourselves with to pass the time be it social media, video games, books, youtube videos, netflix etc.  yet we have hard time dealing with ourselves once there is nothing to entertain us.  boredom can be a very malicious thing if you are suffering a sense of dread to life and everything that goes in it.  no wonder people are desperate to seek out things outside of themselves to just stay sane wether be a life partner, marriage, kids, wealth, etc. . . i would not wish existence on the worst of my enemies let alone give birth to people into this wretched reality.  please think three times of that before having another baby
i	scared	i havent tried new medications for my anxiety and depression since i was in highschool due to horrible experiences.  my provider wants me to try lexapro or zoloft.  i am tired of continuously ruining my chances of a better future but i am terrified.  i dont know what to expect.  im scared of bad side effects.  im scared ill get worse or i wont know if its helping.  i know i want to change, i hope all of these years i havent ruined my chances at being a normal happy person.  i dont know what its like to experience joy or show emotion other than sadness or anxiety or irritability.  i dont know who i am, this has been my entire life, this is all i really know.  im scared
i	reality.	i was an outcast in highschool.  recently i have discovered with a therapist that my world-view at the time was just a coping mechanism.  i believed wholeheartedly that i was like a main character in a movie and i was going to end up with the guy who was my first true love and get a happy ending.  that didn't happen.  i also convinced myself that one day i would be scouted by a record label and would sign a record deal propelling me to stardom and all the popular girls at school would become jealous of me.  that didn't happen.  instead i lived an average ass life and never got my moment in the spotlight and ended up with boyfriends that always liked me first and i just eventually agreed to start a relationship with.  it wasn't the amazing moment i was longing for.  now i'm getting older and main characters in movies are getting younger and younger.  i can't use this dream to help me cope with life anymore.  the curtain has been pulled back, now i see life for the truly depressing meaningless thing it is.  and this whole time i was just using a coping mode to distract myself from that grim reality. 
feeling bad	slept in	so today i was  <e1> feeling bad </e1> , and  <e2> slept in </e2> .  i woke up at noon and i checked my phone.  i had like calls and messages from my friends, worried about me and thought i had hurt myself.  i dunno i guess just a funny story, hope everyone is doing well. 
do	screen	do i have to be a certain age here? idkanyway not sure what to say kinda just wanted to get it out thereyephonestly not sure what to type maybe if someone tells me i'll make another post or just write in the commentsi was gonna write my whole life story but then i thought i don't wanna bother people with my confusingnessbut then again my heart wants me to speakshould i?  eh idk i'm conflictedscared people will judge and it's like i know what to say but i don't know how to say iti'm rambling through text rn that's weird. . just typing my current thoughtsi should probably sleep 6 am right now and i've been drowning in my computer screen
man	now	man have i been feeling like shit i genuinely was debating on ending it this weekend but my friend today sent me a box of edible arrangements and told me i was someone she cared about.  it made me smile really wide for the first time in a while, and it was a smile i didnt have to feel guilty about. i know ill be back to feeling shit soon but im just happy for now
confused	i understand i did really well and literally cant achieve more than a 100%	i have struggled this entire academic semester but somehow managed to get a perfect score a final exam.  this should have been great news for me but i am writing it off as a coincidence.  i am  <e1> confused </e1>  with myself because  <e2> i understand i did really well and literally cant achieve more than a 100% </e2> , but honestly i feel like i could have done better somehow. every time i try to compliment myself or allow myself to feel pride i counter it with something negative or false.  for example, ill say you got a perfect score you should be proud i think no you could have done better or the score was a mistake and the professor probably graded the exam incorrectlyanyone else experience anything similar? have you found any solutions that help you allow yourself to receive compliments and be proud of your personal achievements?
sucks	always answer their calls or text and they just dont seem to ever reciprocate	i find it hilarious that unless im on the verge of ending it, no one around me pays attention.  i recently relapsed into another depressive episode and as soon as i did everyone just went quite.  its like they only want to have conversations with me when im mentally okay but when i actually need their help, no where to be found.  and it  <e1> sucks </e1>  because i  <e2> always answer their calls or text and they just dont seem to ever reciprocate </e2> .  yet, when im like i want to end it ohh everyone comes flocking.  i guess i cant blame they who would want their energy drained by a depressive person.  i guess streaming services, porn and food will get me through it again or not. 
know hes not mentally doing well either	dont want to set him off	i (25) am going through my first loss of an adult friend.  he was a work friend and we worked together for about 2 years and we would routinely get drinks together with our significant others.  he also has anxiety and depression and hasnt been himself for months, but i tried my best to be supportive and loving.  he got a better job and quit and again super supportive and super happy for him on my end and now hes stopped answering my texts.  i  <e1> know hes not mentally doing well either </e1>  so i  <e2> dont want to set him off </e2> , but im tired of walking on eggshells.  some of my biggest insecurities are that im always the one to reach out, but no one ever reaches out to me.  i feel like im so excited to be friends with people, but no one ever feels that way about being my friend.  i was a really shy kid growing up and it was always hard to make friends and it still is a challenge for me.  this is my first loss of a friend in a long time and its just hitting all my insecurities. 
the sertraline keeps me calm and stops me wanting to kill myself	better off on them even tho i end up constantly tired	i hate working full time, but then i hate going to university, i hate everything it seems and would be happy to be left alone to be honest.   <e1> the sertraline keeps me calm and stops me wanting to kill myself </e1>  so i'm  <e2> better off on them even tho i end up constantly tired </e2> . v
for	represents.	for the past couple of months, i have been having this weird feeling inside me, i don't really know how to describe it, but i guess all you need to know is that feeling makes me unhappy, i don't know what this feeling is or why its happening to me, i have a good life, nothing to complain about.  but this feeling haunts me.  but sometimes it goes away at random for about 1-2 weeks and i start feeling happy again and just enjoy life, but it comes back at random.  i cant figure out why i'm feeling this, or what this feeling represents. 
haven't talked to anyone or even moved since i got home	have not motivation to do anything at all	i've dealt with depression before.  i've been fairly depressed since 2015, but finally came out of it early this year.  things were going good.  i was working a new job, working on personal relationships, and working on projects i had wanted to do for a long time.  then today, there was a freak accident.  i was driving to work and my pickup started fish tailing.  i usually try to have something heavy in the back to weigh it down, but i had cleaned it out recently and forgot to put anything back.  i hit a patch of thick gravel and crashed head on into a concrete bridge.  somehow i didn't end up going off the bridge, and i didn't get too badly injured, but the pickup got totaled.  the worst part is the pickup was my dad's, and i was borrowing it, and it wasn't ensured.  he says he's not mad at me but i can tell he's disappointed.  i don't even know what to do.  i just feel so worthless.  i don't know what i could've done, but i keep beating myself up over it and i feel so stupid.  i  <e1> haven't talked to anyone or even moved since i got home </e1>  and i just  <e2> have not motivation to do anything at all </e2> .  life fucking sucks. 
but	memory.	but i am actually only 30. the truth is,  i don't want to have any responsibilities,  i don't  want to work, i just want to spend my time playing games and watching shows.  however, my body is in pain constantly, constant back pain,  i got hypertension and very low testosterone level, poor eye sight and poor memory. 
i	sleep.	i try my best to wake up every day in a good mood and cherish every moment that i get to experience.  life has gotten harder and harder the past few years.  my friends think im sad over nothing.  im sad over everything.  i cant remember the last time i was happy.  i dont want to feel like this anymore.  my beautiful fianc and step son are the only things keeping me alive and sane.  i just want to fall back in love with life.  i want to love myself again.  after my dad died i gave up on myself and have watched myself deteriorate more and more.  i dont even know what steps to take to make things better.  i just want to sleep. 
too ashamed to go out on a date	binge eating and falling off track on my weight loss journey	i'm having a really bad episode rn as this is a hard time of year for me due to grieving.  i tried so hard to prevent it.  i thought i was gonna be stronger than this but here i am with a messy apartment. . . dishes from a month ago still in the sink.  too ashamed for anyone to come over.   <e1> too ashamed to go out on a date </e1>  from  <e2> binge eating and falling off track on my weight loss journey </e2> .  hygiene not the best right now but i finally showered today after 3 days.  and i'm scared to lose the new person i've been talking to because of this disorder.  i dont want to be seen like this. 
can	.	can i just ask if 2021 can kindly fuck off?! i've lost 2 of the most important people in my life within a month of one another. . .  i'm overwhelmed at work and university and i graduated from my first degree. . .  online!!! nobody cared.   i am just so over this year as i a literally feeling like i am in a constant limbo.  i've been trying everything to stay motivated, have energy and do the most, but i literally have no power and no will to push through year. i am falling prey to my depression again after being fine actually for 3 months. .  i was doing so well for 3 months and then 2021 and life was like. .  bitch get back in your place! i just want to cry and not keep on doing this year.  i wish i can just forward time to get rid of this shitty year. . 
point where i try	dont want people to say i didnt	its come to the  <e1> point where i try </e1>  because i  <e2> dont want people to say i didnt </e2> .  but really, i just want to give up.  i feel useless, unneeded, desperate for some kind of positive feeling that lasts more than a day.  my heart feels heavy and i cry about everything, it feels like i never run out of tears like people say i should.  they just keep pouring out and with them, my soul.  my world is falling apart at the seams and i cant seem to tell if i caused all of it or not.  the voices in my head are getting louder as the days go on and what was once easy to ignore is becoming impossible.  i can quite literally feel my heart cracking in my chest everyday, and i cant mend it.  im giving up, and i dont know who to tell. 
hi,	that	hi, i am a 24 years old man with a good life, i have some hobbies i have a good job that i like but recently i started to become bored with life.  it's not like i want to die right now but i think there is nothing exciting going to happen future maybe expect few moments.  i'm thinking of death through hanging or some medicines.  please don't respond me with some shit like life is beautiful.  i wanted this post to be longer but in the middle of text i decided i don't want to write more so it's kind of shitpost sorry for that
it	that.	it can also make me intensely aware of the tiniest of 'happy things'. like the thing that inspired me to make this post: my ginger cat is sleeping peacefully beside me on the couch, and sometimes as he's fast asleep i can't help but gently pet him. the fact that he trusts me and the peace in our house enough to not be startled, but instead do the stretch+snoot hug. . . there's something about having and honouring the complete trust given to me by an(y) animal, it's so pure. anyway, i hope this doesn't come across as toxic positivity, i certainly don't mean it to be that way.  today is just a rare day i'm acutely aware of the love i have for tiny things some people don't seem to notice, or take for granted.  the darkness i see and feel is still interrupted by tiny shiny stuff every now and then, and so far apparently that has been enough.  today i am thankful for that. 
i	:)	i don't know what it the sea air from a few days ago or just a switch going off in my head, but i cleaned up my disaster of a room and decided to ghost some people in my life for good on social media, it's not that they were very toxic, but i think they were just a chapter of my life that i think needed to end. i've awakened with a new sense of clarity, life is slowly returning back to normal.  i don't feel as depressed as before. being off from work for half a year, healing from major surgery, during a global pandemic, certainly wasn't on my cards for 2020/21.  i haven't enjoyed much of anything in the last 4 years.  but that's about to change again soon :)
I	complicated	I hate never being able to tell if the narrative in my head is accurate or if my brain is manipulating it to make it seem like someone's being mean or rude when in reality they're not and im perceiving it through my bpd brain not only does it make me incredibly vulnerable to gaslighting and manipulation but it also makes me likely to react inappropriately or unintentionally be passive aggressive.  I absolutely fucking hate hurting people it makes me feel like I'm literally dying when I hurt somebody it makes me incredibly suicidal I hate being a lot for my loved ones I hate being overwhelming to be around all I want in life is to make people happy and give out love and also to be loved why does everything have to be so complicated
Crying	head.	Crying silently in the doctor's waiting room after having just had my vaccine.  I basically opened up an email from my MA supervisor with feedback on my thesis proposal.  Her email tone seemed terse and her feedback in the document was not overtly bad, but just not what I was expecting.  I feel like I've done something to upset her or she just seems annoyed at something with my proposal.  Normally she's very complimentary but some of her comments are implying things that aren't true and I'm upset that she's misinterpreted it.  And here I am, crying over something in front of others that I've most probably exaggerated in my head. 
I	days	I know this feeling freaks others out a lot, but it's how i survive in this overwhelming worldDoes anyone else smoke weed 24/7 and do bare minimum until they randomly get the courage to try again at life and then end up back in the same cycle after becoming overwhelmed with life again?3 weeks feels like 3 days
Sometimes	bad.	Sometimes I just switch into a state of mind where I completely lose my shit and get physical. In moments like that I have no empathy and there is almost nothing left of my personality. I'm just all in for violence and hurt and I don't care what it costs. I say extremely mean things that leave people scarred and if that isn't enough I just get physical. The thing that makes me get physical the most is crying.  I hate crying. When I'm in an argument or in a fight and someone starts whining I just want them to shut the fuck up. And I'll make them. It can switch like that within seconds.  One second I'm all happy and in love with the entire world and it can all change within a single moment. I don't wanna be like that.  But no matter how hard I try to avoid that behaviour, it will always happen again. People never realise that my soul hurts from the constant anger.  After fights and arguments I tend to cut myself pretty bad. 
I	suggestions?	I think I was doing it wrong.  Like jumping from 100% to apathetic was kind of wack.  And I kind of realised I was still caring what ppl thought but I just wasnt conforming to it.  And i was just being negative and feeling like i didnt care even at times itd make sense for me to care. Now im trying to figure out how to balance not caring what ppl think of me yet still being caring and kind. I think it was like dont care what ppl think, dont care about them sort of thing.  But i dont need to abandon empathy inorder to not people please. Anyone have any suggestions?
started	fml	started new meds 3. 5 weeks ago and started to take a big decline and feeling depressed.  i screamed at myself in the shower and told myself how much of a mistake my parents made bringing me into the world on top of other really hateful comments.  felt almost cathartic but still cant help but feel like a useless sad sack of shit who cannot be happy and stable like everyone else fml
i feel that that name isn't much better	it uses a symptom to define the whole disorder when there is much more to BPD than just being emotionally unstable	so it's no secret that BPD is a super stigmatized and misunderstood disorder, and the name really doesn't help.  it has also been named emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) but  <e1> i feel that that name isn't much better </e1>  because  <e2> it uses a symptom to define the whole disorder when there is much more to BPD than just being emotionally unstable </e2> . if you could rename BPD, what would you call it? i was wondering if anyone has thought of any names that could better encompass the wide range of symptoms/characteristics better than borderline personality and emotionally unstable personality
im	working	im trying so hard to just talk to my partner about what bothers him about my behavior and what i can do to be better and what his boundaries are but when i tell him im insecure and that i love him and he doesnt reassure me or says that he does too i just feel like breaking i cant handle it.  i want to have a conversation but it hurts so bad i cant stop crying.  i tried to calm down first but its not working
Self	bpd.	Self harm is always one of the go to symptoms of criteria for bpd that I’d see whenever I research this pd.  I’m just curious on how important that aspect is when it comes to having bpd. 
My	rn	My dog, Loki is literally my entire life.  He was a rescue and seemed just about as broken as me.  I love this dog more than anyone on this earth.  He is all I have and the only one that has been there for me through EVERYTHING.  He has been through abuse with me.  He has seen physical violence towards me. . .  this dog is my safe place.  If something happens to him. . .  I have less than ZERO faith in myself that I won’t try to “unalive”again.  My FP doesn’t want me and they were the one person who actually made me feel loved. .  but they don’t fucking care now and they don’t think about anything but themselves.  The fear of abandonment with BPD is one thing. . .  but when they actually shut you out. . .  over and over. .  I feel stuck.  Yet there is this dog that would never hurt me or leave me, loves me unconditionally and he only gets a short time on this earth????? Literally inconsolable rn
Had	am.	Had a wonderful day with wonderful new people and a really nice guy, now I'm home and I can't stop smiling.  Like the whole way home and the 40 min that I'm here, I feel like it shouldn't be allowed to be  so happy.  In moments like this I can't stop thinking about how other people feel, people who are not so  extreme in their emotions.  I'm really glad that I'm alive and able to feel so much joy and love rushing through my body, even with every downside of bpd I'm happy with who I am. 
I’m	now.	I’m falling back into old habits, wanting to do reckless activities that I used to do 10 years ago that I really shouldn’t get back into.  Lately I have been wanting to put a razor to my skin so bad (haven’t cut in 7 years) but I know my partner would be disappointed in me.  Im considering hiding it because I need to feel the pain… I know I shouldn’t and I don’t know why I’m getting the urge to do something I thought I was over.  I can’t stop thinking about it I feel like I need it… Im also falling back into disordered eating habits I feel myself sinking but I can’t stop myself.  Can anyone relate to falling into old habits? I stopped cutting around age 19 I’m 26 now. 
I'm	value!	I'm in group therapy at the moment and I just feel like it's a massive waste of my time. The therapists are just reading off of a booklet they gave us, everyone is trauma dumping for the entire session and talking over the therapists and they are doing nothing to stop them. The people in the group blame everyone else for their problems and say people with mental illness are 'awful' and psychos. . .  Just adding to the fucking stigmaI swear I come out of these sessions so fucking angry I just don't see it adding any value!
Every	MIND.	Every single person I speak to tell me I need to ground myself.  I am in crisis, in full meltdown, every single day, for hours.  At least 4-6 hours of every single day of my life for the last two months are spent in full crisis mode.  My entire body is wracked with pain, I am 100% certain I will die in the next 5-10 years from a stroke from the severe ammount of crushing stress and anxiety and melt down and crisis I feel. I am in severe serious bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad.  I am in crisis right now.  I cannot form thoughts.  I cannot find release. Everyone TELLS ME I must GROUND MYSELF.  NO ONE WILL TELL ME HOW TO GROUND MYSELF.  NO ONE WILL TEACH ME DBT.  eVERY single person keeps insisting GROUND IS WHAT YOU NEED, DBT IS WHAT YOU NEED. no one NO ONE WILL HELP ME OBTAIN THESE THINGS.  I AM LOSING MY MIND. 
I’ve	works.	I’ve been working at this fucking disorder for 5 years now.  And I keep fucking up and splitting and lashing out and making mistakes.  I know what the recovery would look like.  I knew going down this path would not be a perfect happy go lucky journey.  It’s 2 steps forward, 5 steps back.  Relapse after relapse, mistake after mistake, flash back after flash back.  I don’t want this anymore.  I don’t want to keep “working” on myself to just get through the next day.  I felt “ok” for a bit but whoops I fucked up and ruined my day yesterday.  Don’t you see how painful this is? I feel I need to convey this only through suicide.  I am in constant pain and I’d rather just give up and give in.  I’m sorry to anyone who knows me or cares.  But I really can’t live with this demon that is BPD.  You’ll understand why I truly felt once I’m gone.  Only then does everyone understand, care, and have regrets.  It’s sad I have to resort to suicide to have any form of love.  That’s the way the world works. 
I'm not really sure what to title this	forgive me for the weird title	 <e1> I'm not really sure what to title this </e1>  so  <e2> forgive me for the weird title </e2> .  I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 in 2017 after a hospital stay and I just kinda accepted it and none of the medical professionals I've had since then haven’t really argued with it, well until today I guess. My doctor recommended me to a Psychiatrist to get an official ADHD diagnosis and today was the last session, where he proceeded to tell me that he believes I was misdiagnosed with bipolar and actually have BPD and now I'm not sure what to do.  I feel empty and alone, my partner is being as supportive as they can but it's just not helping.  I don't really have any other friends with BPD so I thought maybe I could try reaching out here and see if anyone had any advice or ideas or words of comfort. Thanks. 
Not being able to open my mouth to eat	my temples are swollen and sore	I challenged myself with fitting my verses in with the title acronym s. i. t. b. i. d.  which I shortened from self inflicted traumatic brain injury damage.  As lately I've been constantly punching myself, or inflicting damage to my head via blunt objects. .  I have been struggling a lot with the pain I experience lately from this. .   <e1> Not being able to open my mouth to eat </e1>  because  <e2> my temples are swollen and sore </e2> . .  My hands and knuckles and wrists always feeling broken.   I'm tired of being controlled by these impulses.  Any time I let someone down or feel as though I've hurt someone I start this self destructive behaviour and it takes a lot to calm me down. Anyways. .  here's my song/poem.  I'll probably add more as time goes on, and if I do turn this into a song I'll let you know if at all interested. . s. i. t. b. i. d. Falling away from myself, I feel it againthe separation from the control within?There's nothing now that you can doThe pain is now coming down on you?Self inflicted trauma, brain injured, damaged. ?No escape from the wailing, flurry of appendage. ?So I try, beyond ideation. .  death. . ?
It’s	basis?	It’s gotten to a point that it’s hard for me to function.  I’m either super depressed like suicidal or really happy and euphoric and I think that life is great and I’m excited about things, but it usually lasts 30 minutes, an hour if I’m lucky.  It happens maybe 2 times a day but usually it ends drastically and I’m back to feeling like trash in a matter of seconds.  How do you deal with the really high highs and the really low lows on a daily basis?
I'm	what.	I'm not saying any kind of abuse or threats is ever okay.  It's wrong in every situation no matter what. What I want to know is how do I figure out exactly how to feel while something is happening instead of looking back and realizing I overreacted over something small or a misunderstanding.  How do I know when to stand up for myself and put my foot down or when to adjust and be accommodating. I feel like there is no winning for me.  I can either be a pushover and let people do whatever makes them happy (only to explode some time I  the future).  Or I can be a raging bitch and never give an inch to anyone. I can literally never see what is happening in real time with an objective and rational perspective.  I either feel bad about being taken advantage of or I feel bad about not being considerate of other people.  I can't seem to do right in any situation no matter what. 
If	us?	If so, how can we qualify for it? I’m high-functioning, just finished my MA but I’m afraid to go back to work.  During graduate school I had two nervous breakdowns and some very intense depressive episodes stemming from toxic relationships breaking down.  I’m afraid of going back to work, but I’ll keep on trying anyways.  But just wondered if there are any benefits for people who are diagnosed w BDP in the us?
I’m gonna kill myself	I have felt this good in ages	So are used to be afraid of taking medication I always seek out other things like alcohol in certain type of drugs never any hard drugs just weird and I feel so happy after taking promethazine I’m prescribed with and scared when this high comes down  <e1> I’m gonna kill myself </e1>  because  <e2> I have felt this good in ages </e2> 
Does	this?	Does anyone else watch a show and find themselves using the same lingo, mannerisms, same persona as one or multiple people in the show? I feel like it partly has to do with the fact that I have no idea who I am and I’m just an empty shell that latches on to the next new thing.  Or I’m just exaggerating and everyone does this?
So	are!Help	So I had a moment where I forgot my money/time constraints in trying to please a friend, and now I'm going to have to let her down and I don't want to. I said I would come to her city (2 1/2 hours away) for the day to celebrate our birthdays (they're close in date) together along with her boyfriend, friend and one mutual friend of ours.  This was before I realised that it'd cost a lot of money to go before even the drinks etc.  have been paid for and that I'd be travelling for 5 and a half hours in a day. I really don't want to disappoint her, just did the thing again where I overestimated how much money and time I had free. I feel awful and I don't know a) how to break it to her (it's in a week) and b) how to prevent myself being such a people pleaser.  She's already asking me what time my trains are!Help
I	feeling?	I hung out with my friend for the entire night and then in the morning hung out with a different friend, and the second I got home I felt like shit.  I don’t know why? But I feel so sad and lonely and empty.  I’m so tired but I can’t sleep, I have no thoughts but I can’t stop thinking if that makes any sense.  I don’t understand I thought I was doing good and getting better but now I’m back in the same low spot, and I dislike it greatly.  Makes me feel so bad.  Does anyone else experience this? And does anyone know anything I can do to help with this feeling?
I	do.	I just recently got diagnosed with BPD & was put on medicine.  I have only been on for 3 days but I’m feeling a heightened sense of paranoia, suicidal thoughts, & i feel like i can’t wake up.  I know that this is something I probably should seek immediate attention for but I am so embarrassed & don’t want to be a burden to my family.  I also have been institutionalized before & I am really scared to go back.  I don’t know where to turn or what to do. 
I	myself.	I have had two therapists whic feels like a lot to me even though I know it’s not.  I just moved and want to find someone else but I’m really worried it won’t be a good match again.  How many therapists is too many? How do you weed out who will be a good fit without hurting their feelings?I have the expectation that therapy should be life changing and help me but I don’t know anymore.  I really believe I can get better.  Are my expectations too high? I am willing to do the work and Am dying to, but my last therapist never asked questions and just gave me dbt worksheets that were helpful, but we didn’t address any of my underlying issues AT ALL.  I just felt ignored and it became about having an agenda for our sessions rather than me expressing myself. 
Feeling	now.	Feeling immense regret over how I handled my mood swing.  I’ve been experiencing some extremely stressful social relations the past few months and became quite indignant about it not being solved. During a really upsetting time I contemplated (but never did) self-harm, for the first time in 5 years.  Now, during an argument over the incidents which occurred, I became really volatile and upset and brought up the fact I considered SH, a move which I am now really regretting. While I really did mean to convey that the feelings of SH were real, I see how it comes of as though I used it as a mere manipulation tactic to win over support/sympathy. Feeling immense guilt, regret, and self-loathing now. 
First	month?	First of all I'm proud of myself getting hired at the company I wanted. But my thoughts are already spiraling:Will they like me?Will they hate me and think: another fat IT supporter?What if I make a mistake and they judge me forever?What if the toilet is too small or dirty and I have to go there?How should I start talking to them to get to know each other without awkward situations?What if my knowledge and performance is not great and they let me go in a month?
which is confusing	I do this when I’m anxious too lol	What does anger look like for everyone here?Mine isn’t very explosive as I’ve been told bpd is supposed to have(I do have one instance where it was).  I think a lot of times I’m kind of out of touch with anger.  I never really knew when I was angry or what it felt to be( with the extreme cases).   Just recently I have realized that my anger comes in the form of me distancing myself from people or just being cold to them( <e1> which is confusing </e1>  cause  <e2> I do this when I’m anxious too lol </e2> ).  I’m interested into learning about everyone else’s anger tropes. 
It	pleasing?	It was my mum's partners 70th bday and I decided not to go.  They've been together a year.  I'm currently living with them after breaking up with my ex of 10 years.  I'm still heavily grieving the loss of my ex and her family.  I don't have the emotional capacity to sit with a bunch of strangers all day (I went to the last 2 things) and pretend I'm okay.  It just makes me feel more homesick for somewhere I can't go home too.  Normally mum would go off at me (she might be saving that for later) but they both just seemed dissapointed when I said I wasnt going.  So now I feel like an awful person for putting my needs first.  Is that normal? I feel like it defeats the purpose of doing what's best for me for once.  Or is this just the kind of feeling you get when you stop people pleasing?
My plans all fail	I’m so indecisive	I feel like dealing with depression and bpd has snuffed out my potential completely in some areas of my life and tremendously slowed it down in other ways.  I’m only 21 but I feel like I don’t have the capability to do all the things I dreamed of doing.   <e1> My plans all fail </e1>  because  <e2> I’m so indecisive </e2>  and I took a year off college which I never thought I would do, during which I did nothing and I literally feel so ashamed about. I occasionally watch Jordan Peterson’s clips and while I have reservations about him, I noticed there is only one very short clip about bpd and in it he says “they’re [bpd patients] often quite intelligent and you see in the person with bpd something like the waste or the squandering of tremendous potential. . . ” I really felt this and it makes me miss the life I could have had.  I feel like I have sand bags tied to my feet.  I don’t know if it’s better to try and recover my potential or just let go and accept a shittier, dimmer reality.  Is this a black and white thought? Cause I can’t fucking tell. 
i am upset	I know it is wrong and worries me	I find myself seeing tiny little things about people as a horrible offense and I am livid inside, my mind then races to horrible things I might say or threaten them with.  I never shout or say anything but  <e1> i am upset </e1>  because  <e2> I know it is wrong and worries me </e2> .  I am not a bad person and have not had a history of violence I just want to know if anyone else has this. 
i feel like such a horrible person	not being eternally grateful for all the good things i have	i mean yes, good things that you’re grateful for don’t minimise the pain and suffering you do go through.  but for about almost 2 painful months i’ve been crying and hoping that me and my fp would be close like we were before again.  it killed me every day i kept crying and i just couldn’t function or be happy about any of my other friendships. and now we’re close like that again.  we’re close again like i wanted to be, like i sobbed and wished we could be.  we talk a lot everyday but i can’t even enjoy it.  when he says i love you, i don’t even feel happy anymore.  its like, i can’t be satisfied with anything i have, its never enough and i always want the next thing. how am i supposed to cope if every situation inevitably brings me dissatisfaction?and  <e1> i feel like such a horrible person </e1>  for  <e2> not being eternally grateful for all the good things i have </e2> . 
DAE	it.	DAE catch themselves being completely jealous of their FP’s other relationships? My fiancé (23m) and I (25f) recently got into a huge fight over his “best friend”.  I don’t have much over him, except I cannot stand him.  I think he is sneaky and a bad influence.  My fiancé turns into a different person when he’s around.  I can’t tell if I’m jealous or in my right mind over it. 
My	him?	My partner of just about a year broke up with me the other day and I can’t stop being anxious about it.  We hooked up, said he doesn’t want a partner, and now it seems we’re labelless? I don’t know what to do, we work together and he’s been my person for a year.  What if he loves someone else? What if I’m alone or get this hurt again? Is it okay to sit in the realm of uncertainty with him?
I	worked?	I was diagnosed with BPD in April and have been taking Zoloft, Lamictal, and Buspirone.  I am still on low doses of all of these but already have noticed a marked difference in the intensity of my emotions.  My anxiety has lessened, I am able to be more “present,” my relationship with my partner has improved, and for the first time in a long time I feel hopeful and alive.  I am starting DBT as well.  I know that treating BPD with medication has highly variable effects depending on the individual, and may not even work for some.  But I am curious to know what medications have worked for you? What have you tried that hasn’t worked?
I've	unappreciated	I've been feeling so lonely in this relationship.  Tonight, I ordered this fancy grazing platter and wine hoping to have a good evening.  He just ate the cold cuts and cheese, had a small sip of wine and then left me to play an online poker tournament.  I was the one trying the whole time to initiate meaningful conversation about him, always about him.  It's a saturday night.  This isn't how i pictured things would be.  I feel so ignored and unappreciated
Do	it?	Do any of you ever get intrusive thoughts about other people that you realize are really mean and have no idea why you’d ever think such things in your head so then you feel bad or guilty about it?
Now she comes upstairs to yell at me that I didn't wash any of the pots in the sink even though I was letting them soak	my dad wouldn't leave them that way and it was our job (my mom’s and mine) to clean up after dinner	Since getting the text from and ex’s aunt my mother has gone from understanding to yelling at me about how I feel like a loser and angry with me that I haven't told my ex’s aunt to fuck off.   <e1> Now she comes upstairs to yell at me that I didn't wash any of the pots in the sink even though I was letting them soak </e1> , because  <e2> my dad wouldn't leave them that way and it was our job (my mom’s and mine) to clean up after dinner </e2> .  I put away all the food whipped out every pan and let them soak.  And she wonders why I feel constantly bad about myself
I'm quiet BPD	any kind of added stress I would take out on myself	Things have been so grim since covid started, all I've wanted to do is give back.  I tried political stuff and protests but where I live that can be met with armed militias, so I stepped away from that and just help by donating from afar now. I've wanted to join CASA for a while-they're advocates for displaced kids.  I had a really messed up childhood and feel like a orphan myself these days.  I'm probably not having kids but always wanted them so it seems fitting.   <e1> I'm quiet BPD </e1>  so  <e2> any kind of added stress I would take out on myself </e2> .  I think I'm strong enough right now.  I have goals and a future I'm excited about.  Weekly therapy.  I'm getting my shit together.  I still worry if I'm strong enough for this. Any other BPD ppl do community work and face harsh realities doing it? Does it work? How do you make it work?
I kept my cool but since then my thoughts and mood have been horrendous I despite it,maybe	I sometimes view myself as crazy but damn it hurt. . unless its someone very close to me who I am open with e,g about 3 people I take and react to this as a literal attack and have to spend the rest of the day cooling down,,that aside I do find her comment rude and abrasive,,as she knows I struggle with mental health	If anyone somewhat mockingly calls me crazy even in a sort of understandable context I start rethinking my entire life,I want to stab them and I'll cry later which is I  guess a legitimately pretty crazy internal response to what they probably consider a joke.  Today was tricky though an acquaintance of mine hit me with the sarcastic are you okay stared at me for 5 seconds followed with. . mentally' I told them no I'm not and they responded with a yeah,,I know.   <e1> I kept my cool but since then my thoughts and mood have been horrendous I despite it,maybe </e1>  because  <e2> I sometimes view myself as crazy but damn it hurt. . unless its someone very close to me who I am open with e,g about 3 people I take and react to this as a literal attack and have to spend the rest of the day cooling down,,that aside I do find her comment rude and abrasive,,as she knows I struggle with mental health </e2> 
I	have?	I love my life, I love my boyfriend, I love the home we share, I love my friends, I love how much I have learnt about myself, I love how I feel more comfortable in my body than ever before.   I’m so happy- I don’t think I’ve ever felt this happy before.  BUT now I have this intense urge to blow up and self-destruct.  It feels as though I’m one argument or confrontation or negative encounter away from totally destroying everything and pushing everyone away.  I can already feel myself withdrawing and becoming distant and apathetic. I really really don’t want to do this but I don’t know how to quiet these thoughts.  Does anyone relate or have any tips on how to be more present and appreciate what I have?
Hi	him?	Hi Everyone! I’ve been in many abusive relationships and recently entered a 6 month relationship where the guy is really nice but not at all emotionally attentive.  He cares but can sometimes be insensitive.  It ends up with me on a fortnightly basis saying that I dislike the relationship.  While I think my reaction to things he does can be extreme I think I’m tired of feeling like an evil gf for always bringing up problems and making him feel like he’s never good enough.  Fundamentally I think he is a good person but we aren’t compatible.  Been suggesting couples counselling but he wants to try himself so I think I’m just going to break up with him now.  So what type of person is right for someone who struggles with BPD, PTSD and suicidal ideation? Any advice before I breakup with him?
i know it’s toxic to express the thoughts i have and some what manipulative	i don’t	anytime i do something wrong and someone gets upset with me (rightfully so as well) it almost causes an episode internally every time.   <e1> i know it’s toxic to express the thoughts i have and some what manipulative </e1>  so  <e2> i don’t </e2> .  i made a mistake with my bf and he was mad at me and in my head all i could think was ‘i ruin everything. ’ ‘people would be better off without me fuxking things up’.  i maturely apologized thought without showing these thoughts and he went to bed still s bit upset at me.  but now my mind just wants to tell me that i’m the most horrible person ever.  i just wanna know i’m not alone. TLDR: i wanna know i’m not alone in feeling extreme guilt and beating myself up anytime someone comes to me and tells me i do wrong.

I’m	felt	I’m sat in bed drinking beers and eating a whole wheel of Brie by myself and intend to do this for the rest of the weekend because life is meaningless and no matter what good things happen to me I’ll always have an empty soul sucking void inside of me clinging to the past clinging to the love I lost and clinging to how badly I want to throw myself off a cliff every waking moment no matter how much things look up for me I just want to drown myself in alcohol, be sedated and cease existing no matter how many good things happen to me I’ll always just want to stay within the chains of my bed numbing every emotion I’ve ever felt
All	yourself?	All my friends and family who suffer from BPD, myself included, have 0 maybe even negative levels of self worth.  I have yet to meet someone or encounter someone online with BPD who truly loves themselves.  Is it ever possible for us to? Everyone always tells me I can’t heal my ptsd and BPD if I don’t love myself but I feel that saying that is like telling a depressed person to just be happy. . . . Do you love yourself?
When	through.	When I met my partner, I felt like I had been saved, they became my favorite person, I grew dependant on them.  I have been struggling really bad for over a year now, the isolation doesn't help.  He and I get into fights often but irrational and often overlooked when we find the source of them.  But I recently found out he's been getting a LOT of backlash from his family and they all want him to leave me.  Call me childish, THREATEN ME.  He tells me that it doesn't matter that they want him to leave because he loves me, but I already feel like I'm holding him back daily, and I know I'm irrational but it's hard to control.  (I'm working on it) But I'm scared and confused and hate myself a lot right now.  I think I want to leave.  But I'm not sure if I'm being irrational.  He is the best thing that's ever happened to me.  He is validating, caring, sweet, thoughtful, and helped me find myself.  And I don't want to lose him.  But I'm scared and honestly hate myself for what I put him through. 
I	really.	I feel as though I have no identity, all my mannerisms, hobbies (I never keep one for longer than a few weeks), traits, likes and interests were all absorbed by someone close to me to seem more likeable or interesting.  I'm just a rag doll of different people in my life stitched together. I understand that spending time with people it is normal to pick up traits, but I feel as though this goes far beyond the realm of normal.  I feel as though my whole identity is based on those around me, and when I'm by myself, I do nothing, provided I'm not feeling manic I just sit on my phone or go for a drive, I am empty and feel nothing when I'm not busy trying to make people think I'm someone they should like to be around. Does anyone else feel this way? It worries me as I keep trying to convince myself that though this is a personality disorder, my personality isn't flawed, but it definitely feels flawed, or non existent really. 
every single thing becomes my fault	something I did or did not do	When splitting, an A-Typical BPD human will do the I love you/I hate you/don't leave me.  Not me! Because my self depicting depressed ass sees only me as a failure, only my faults,  <e1> every single thing becomes my fault </e1>  because of  <e2> something I did or did not do </e2> .  No one else tells me these things, just my own thoughts.  So I don't 'hate you', you hate me. . . Please tell me what you think?
How	cash?	How do u manage impulsive spending? I REALLY BADLY need to get my spending in order but when ever someone offers to help me by holding onto my money for me or having me ask if it’s ok if I can buy something makes me feel like I’m nothing.  Idk it’s almost like I’m dealing with my parents in my head which makes me feel dependent and I hate having to ask for my money.  I’m not sure if others feel this way but it just makes me feel untrusted even tho Ik I can’t do it myself.  Has anyone tried putting limits on there cards or only using cash?
I highly recommend that everyone looks at attachment science	it's explained my behaviour in regards to romantic relationships down to a tee	Been reading Attached by Dr Amir Levine and Rachel Heller and it's made me realise that my psychologist may be correct.  That I do not have BPD and my extreme behaviours are driven due to my attachment style.  <e1> I highly recommend that everyone looks at attachment science </e1>  as  <e2> it's explained my behaviour in regards to romantic relationships down to a tee </e2> .  I'm hoping it may also help me figure out all other relationships that I encounter including work and familial. Check it out.  Great explanations and recommendations on how to handle relationships with people who have different attachment styles.  Also there are suggestions on how to become more secure in yourself. Makes me feel hopeful for the first time in months.  I'm not broken, just got an anxious attachment style. 
Because	it.	Because I'll end up low again anyway.  Every single time I get myself good for a few weeks or even months, I'll end up low again.  What's the point in fighting if it's temporarily? I know it's the up n down of bpd, but I'm sick of it. 
I	vulnerable.	I realised I haven’t seen my parents in a year.  We haven’t fallen out but due me working 6 days a week and not having access to a car I had limited ways of visiting them.  Since Covid I had been phoning them pretty consistently and felt upset they it was always me reaching out.  I stopped in June and I’ve heard nada. A friend who I haven’t seen in a year who lives locally has dumped hanging out to be with his gf 24/7.  I was trying to schedule time to see him this week but I kept being told the gf wanted to see him on any day I suggested.  They fucking live together. I’ve been single for two years and realised I haven’t had a gift for any occasion for the past six years.  Xmas, birthdays etc.  My last relationship lasted a year and a half and when my bday came around he shamed me for asking why I didn’t get a card. Like I don’t know how people expect me to be happy and cheery when no one fucking gives a fuck.  I am literally on my own.  I feel so vulnerable. 
My	BPD?	My journey has lead me from OCD to autism to codependency and now BPD.  Therapy is always helpful but it's one hour a week and that's not enough to stay grounded and keep making progress for me.  I've found YouTube videos to be immensely helpful so I'm wondering if anyone can recommend any good channels that deal with coping and healing from BPD?
Way	time	Way too many women with autism get misdiagnosed with BPD.  If you’ve never thought about maybe having autism before and it makes sense, please get tested!! Being on mood stabilizers you don’t necessarily need can fuck you up.  I really wish doctors were more aware of the difference in symptoms between boys and girls with autism.  We are more social creatures, we are more apt to hide it, we are more likely to “learn” to be “normal. ” Good luck to you guys, but I’m kinda glad I get to leave this sub.  BPD isn’t a fun disorder. Or maybe I have autism and BPD but that’s a thought for another time
i can't just shut off feelings for her	she's my fp and i really like having her around i don't want to split on hersorry for the ramble	i made a post a little while ago about sexual identity and bpd messing with it but i'm gay and my fp is a girl and it's just really fucking with me i hate feeling like my sexuality isn't valid because i know i'm gay but every time i feel this intense for someone i don't know if it's actually falling for them or just them being a fp and i hate it? i can't do anything about it bc i don't want to ruin things and i'm scared some of the things i think might have been her low key hinting to liking me are just her being a rlly good and supportive fp and just compliments in general bc she says she loves me but it's never in that way that she means it obvioiuslyi don't know what to do,  <e1> i can't just shut off feelings for her </e1>  bc  <e2> she's my fp and i really like having her around i don't want to split on hersorry for the ramble </e2>  but does anyone know wtf i can do about this

I was on such a good way out of this disorder and now I have the feeling having to cut again and can talk to no one	they are all in their own thoughts and grief	Hi,A friend of mine and my friends had died by her own hand.  I got the message yesterday.  Couldn't sleep all night.  Everyone in my friends circle gives themselves the guilty of it.  Everyone thinks they should been there more for her.  I have no tears left.  <e1> I was on such a good way out of this disorder and now I have the feeling having to cut again and can talk to no one </e1> , because  <e2> they are all in their own thoughts and grief </e2> .  Why couldn't I die instead of her?I will miss her, my latest information before I learned about her death was she was in the hospital and safe I though we could write again soon. I hope no of my friends reads this.  I just had to get it off me. Kind regardsSophie
I'm	advice???	I'm 24 and have BPD, I don't have a job and still depend on my parents, I am so ashamed of myself but I don't know how to control my emotions and going out and working scares the shit out of me, I really wanna be functional but still don't know how. Any advice???
I can't really be close with my family	they aren't safe for me and its extremely difficult for my partner to be emotionally available for me	I've made the appointment for this Wednesday afternoon, I know its time but I'm so afraid of the feelings that are coming.  <e1> I can't really be close with my family </e1>  because  <e2> they aren't safe for me and its extremely difficult for my partner to be emotionally available for me </e2> .  (Big surprise, I have consistantly chosen avoidant attachment style men, while I'm anxious attachment) Whenever I come to him in an emotionally honest manner, he becomes so uncomfortable and he tends to just shut down.  I feel abandoned and act like many BPDs do, then my partner's walls go up, making everything worse for both of us. I feel so alone in this process.  My dog has been the one constant reliable thing in my life and now I have to let him go.  I feel like I'm breaking and all I want is someone to comfort me. 
It	anymore.	It just feels like everything feels so good.  You're so happy and it took so long to get there.  Then in seemingly one night it all comes crashing down.  Am I fated to never be happy? Do I have to live my life on eggshells waiting for the moment when everything crashes and burns?I feel sad for anyone in my life.  I feel sad for any future people in my life.  I feel sad for my family.  I feel sad for my pets.  I feel sad for practitioners.  I feel sad for myself. I know it's not supposed to be easy.  Far from it, but I don't know how equipped I am to cope anymore. 
You've	is.	You've been there. . . . you've seen it.  It's left me with the worst feeling of sickness and disgust deep in the pit of my stomach. How does anyone get away with so much hatred and bigotry? Pretty sure people on that sub need mental health intervention as much as anyone with BPD, if even years after the break up (as you won't find people in good relationships there) they still can't get over themselves.  Damn it, it takes me less time to process a grudge! Where do they get off equalizing BPD with narcissism? Looking in a mirror instead of that piss stain of a echo chamber would help them see that any relationship can be healthy if both people are putting in the work. Thankfully, my SO/FP found r/BPDSOFFA.  We've been together 8 years, and it definitely has not been smooth sailing, but even he is disgusted by the cesspool of hatred that r/BPDlovedones is. 
I	errors)	I work in a small office setting, and for the most part all the women in my department are super understanding. But I feel so embarrassed and shameful when I break down crying at work.  Of course I try not to make a big deal and will try to excuse myself to the bathroom or break room.  It’s very obvious when I come back that I had been crying. Does anyone else struggle with randomly breaking down or even breaking down at work? This has happened about three times already and I’m sick of feeling so weak. (Using mobile app, please excuse the errors)
im	goodbye.	im so fucking pathetic. it seems like this has become a theme lately. but it feels like this disorder has taken control of me as a whole, and treatment seems more and more out of reach as the days tick by. im tired. im tired of the moodswings.  im tired of wanting to cry when my boyfriend texts, ok instead of okay.  im tired of getting angry at my mom when she talks too much.  im tired of thinking everyone hates me when i know they dont.  im tired of unintentionally being someone im not.  of being fake.  of not knowing who or what i am.  im tired of splitting.  im tired of fucking trying. i have to give up. i think this could be goodbye. 
I	far.	I feel old as fuck (late 30s).  Currently looking for employment.  In the meantime I've noticed a lot of physical (weight, face, body) and mental (BPD/is it my BPD/depression/anxiety/paranoia/psychosis, yes it's my psychosis!!!??) issues that desperately need my attention.  I address them as best I can but still feel inadequate.  No friends by choice.  I don't want to be hurt/continue to get hurt/hurt others.  No SO.  I miss having a steady relationship but keeping and maintaining boundaries are DIFFICULT!!! I wish that there were something other than fucking DBT like maybe a goddamn lobotomy would straighten me out.  No faith in therapy or any other mental services (psychiatry).  I was diagnosed in the early 2000s.  Every healthcare provider I've been to since brings up BPD vaguely but I've really had no help.  Thanks for reading so far. 
I	pills.	I had an episode today that led to me throwing all my seroquel down the toilet.  It still hasn't flushed still, like it flushed but they just stay at the bottom of the toilet.   Weird pills.

I'm	related.	I'm not sure if it was just me but honestly it feels like it was related to BPD.  As a child I loved roleplaying/playing make-believe games, but I'd either want to be the good character who was secretly evil but the most powerful who has a tragic back story which would make me the victim in being the bad character, or just having such a sad back story so I could constantly be the victim.  One big example I could think of is in the school gym during parent council meeting, all of the kids in the gym would play a good vs evil game where if you got caught your team would have to save you, and I know I would always purposefully get caught so I could be the victim and have my team save me and would feel attacked if no one did/tried to.  It's just weird to me because this was when I was still 7/8 which seems really young for bpd traits to be there, at least to me.  Idk, I was just wondering if anyone related. 
Just	patterns?	Just a thought that popped into my head;Do you think that the more normal and healthy your responses to their behavior are, the madder the pwBPD gets?So for example if they say something that upsets you;Unhealthy behavior: Ignoring it, apologizing for 'making them say it' = keeps BPD happyHealthy behavior: Confronting it, asking them for an apology = makes BPD madSo the more mad they get, the healthier and more normal your responses to abusive and unhealthy behavior patterns?
I	house.	I spent years unhappy in a 25 year marriage.   The specter of my wife's mental illness always loomed over the marriage.   I always assumed it was just depression and anxiety, but there were several things that lasted decades: suicidal ideation, eating disorder, substance abuse.   I always thought they could be handled, then came the absolutely brutal discard, splitting phase.  One day she casually looked up from her phone and told me she didn't want to be married anymore.   Over the next year her behavior became increasingly odd, spaced out at times, she treated me as though I didn't exist, pretty sure there was other men.  She started seeing a psychatrist who treated her for bipolar disorder with every prescription under the sun, her behavior became increasingly bizarre.   I started using words like discard, walking on eggshells Gaslighting, without any idea about BPD.   Finally in desperation I put all the behaviors I could think of into a google search, the first thing that popped up was Borderline Personality disorder.   Thus started my trip down the rabbit hole, eventually winding up here, and thank God for that,  feeling like I am crawling out of a burning house. 
She	be?	She texted that she want to talk about what we want in the relationship, then said that she wants happiness.  This was my reply.  Not that I think she will understand, but it felt good to say. You want me to need you as much as you need me.  You feel empty, lost and scared and don't know who you are.  You want me to be strong and successful so that I can take care of you, but you also want me to be just as depressed and anxious and empty as you so that I will need you like you need me. You want me to take care of you like a parent, but you also want me to be dependent on you like a child.  I cannot be both your parent and your child, and it is not a healthy relationship for me to be either. I can't give you happiness.  The only way you will be happy is if you face the emptiness inside of you, and figure out who you are without anyone else.  If there was nobody else in the world, who would you be?
My	missing.	My ex told she had been with 10-15 guys but I'm fairly certain her real sexual partner count is 3-4x that.  It was very obvious.  People may say it doesn't matter but to me it does.  I'm not comfortable walking around town  regularly walking past 2-3 guys who have banged my girlfriend.  Nor why would I want to invest with someone who has given themselves to 100s of people before me.  Anyway to each of their own. It seems being hyper sexual is a common theme amongst cluster B/ BPD / NPD people.  Did you find this? My ex was like this.  She would regularly watch porn and was addicted to masturbating.  Seemed to only enjoy extremely rough sex.  The sex never really felt intimate it just felt like porn sex it was only ever on that level, some will say that' awesome but honestly it wasn't because it never felt like love . .  something was missing. 
She was open about her BPD	I looked into it pretty early	I just had about 2 months experience with a BPD relationship and think I've come more obsessed by the crazyness talked about and the fact it's really an unknown to so many people than the idea that I am going through the 1st discard cycle (if she cycles may be gone forever).  <e1> She was open about her BPD </e1>  so  <e2> I looked into it pretty early </e2>  and now just sitting back on the crazy train hopefully to jump off soon. . if she discard I might have to lolAnyways it make a hell of a Netflix doc on BPD and non BPD relationships.  I think I might start that process soon as a lover of films/documentary
I imagined just shitting on every person that’s hurt me	I let a mentally disordered person into my life	Anyone here had this yet? When it all finally hits you and instead of making you sad like every other day you just get angry. I was enraged tonight.  Thinking about the manipulation, about my own past, about her games and tricks, how many bad things have happened to me in life for trying to help others, or trying to “do the right thing. ” I hated all human beings.  I had revenge fantasies.   <e1> I imagined just shitting on every person that’s hurt me </e1> , all because  <e2> I let a mentally disordered person into my life </e2> , and they hurt me.  I hated my parents (BPD mother Bipolar father) for raising me in a hell that led me here.  I hated anyone in traffic who was going faster than me, anyone that tried to pass me.  I hated the car in the parking lot next to me playing their shitty music. I hated the whole world, I’m still coming down from the mental trip, but it was like I split the universe black.  Fleas. 
I	one.	I have healed.  I understand not everyone has BPD/NPD or a cluster B personality.   I understand why I may have attracted someone like that.  But there was something about what they did that triggered me so deeply. I've never experienced such dark feelings.  Pure hatred, depression, suicidal thinking, C-PTSD, Flash backs.  It was so bad I lost employment.  I could not sleep.  I could not eat.  I experienced hair loss.  I have pictures of huge bald spots in the back of my head.  My eye was constantly twitching.  I cried and cried.  I was paralysed. It was probably one of the worst experiences of my life.  I should count my self lucky that that's been one of the worst experiences i've had.  There are people suffering horrific diseases and live in poverty. But anyway, how do you date again? I feel like I can't trust or don't believe it when someone is into me.  I never want to experience that again. My ex was demanding i talk and hang out with her and the next she was acting as if i was no one. 
I'm then attacked and ridiculed	seeking friends on subs like r4r by these people	I've had more than one reddit user message me to accuse me or making up the content of my posts/comments here.  These folks don't look like active contributors to this sub, but are mental health experts who just seem to be trolling.   <e1> I'm then attacked and ridiculed </e1>  for  <e2> seeking friends on subs like r4r by these people </e2> .  I'm guessing perhaps these are somewhat self aware people wbpd, spiteful that the people who they have hurt are opening their eyes to what they put them through.  Anyone else have this experience?
Does	thoughts?	Does anyone else suffer from this sometimes? Sometimes i have this fantasy/delusional thinking - thinking it could of worked out, or I could of done something different, or something I could of loved them or said something so they could finally be happy with themselves?There is no doubt my ex had BPD/NPD possibly a combination of both but definitely  Cluster B personality. I remember at the end of the relationship, I started almost seeing what was happening and trying to tell her that she doesn't need to act this way that she should be happy with her self but she just couldn't understand it . . then you see them in another relationship and just wonder?but i know this is just some delusional thinking possibly over empathy , saviour complex. Was wondering if anyone else has these thoughts?
Wanted	.	Wanted to share I went on two dates with a woman after six months of recovering from my BPD ex.  And all I can say is. . .  wow! What a difference so far.  Great conversationalist, interesting, cute, kind and a good communicator.  We have had two sweet little kisses not more than pecks and have a third date on the calendar.  I felt really calm and cool around her, and even though we haven’t had sex or really made out I know she is interested in me.  We text here and there when not together , and I don’t have much anxiety around her.  At first I thought maybe there was a lack of chemistry but now I just think it is the difference between the roller coaster whirlwind of love bombing and taking it slow with a . . . .  normal person. Is this what it feels like to date a non bpd? Or have a secure attachment? It’s definitely different that’s for sure . 
I wouldn’t talk to her	I was so hurt	While we were still together I visited my long distance ex w bpd which was great for the first five days and then ended with her over reacting to something I said and saying she thought we should slow things down and eventually told me to get the fuck outta her house.  After so much push and pull and hot and cold (which she said was natural because she was simply reacting to things I did) I just couldn’t take it anymore and felt like I had nothing to say when she came back to talk as I was looking up car rentals to get around for the rest of my vacation.  After I left She then proceeded to call me on several different phones and  <e1> I wouldn’t talk to her </e1>  because  <e2> I was so hurt </e2> .  I know I’m lucky that I got away , but now I’m confused as to who broke up with who.  I thought her saying “get the fuck outta my house “ was her braking up with me. .  but now I wonder if I was the one who actually ended things.  Who knows what she thinks. 
Hey	haha!	Hey everyone.  I figured I may as well see what wisdom people can off me for my most recent fail! Ok so I took everything written in this thread on board.  It really helped; you guys do! I’ve concentrated on myself, work, friends.  Struggled with dating but to be honest, I think that’s on me not bpdex.  I just haven’t ‘clicked,’ much with anyone.  Anyway, I was feeling low yesterday; my own stuff, things I’ve yet to achieve that are niggling at me.  Idiotically, I thought of him & had a peek at SM.  Eurgh, stupid stupid.  He’s with the same woman he found this January it seems, she’s 7 years older than him(maybe that’s good for him I guess. ) & they’ve moved into a new house together.  Landed some great new job too…It’s really freaking irritated me! He lands on his feet all the time.  She looks ‘alternative/goth’ looking.  He’s nothing of the sort, but he did seem into it, which is fine.  If she’s pregnant then he’s got everything he wanted- besides his other daughter.  Tell me I’m being stupid for feeling sad haha!
I	there.	I feel like something snapped in the last couple days.  After numerous in and out attempts, I think this one will stick.  I no longer want to feel sad or mourn what might have been.  My brain actively says no thank you to what ifs and remembering the good times.  It is what is and was what it was and I am sure of what I do want in a relationship and I wasn't going to get it in this relationship.  I'm not angry or frustrated with him anymore.  I feel sadness and empathy for him but not responsibility.  I know he wants different in life but, unfortunately, there is no amount of loving and supporting from others that can get him there. 
I know this is not an easy question	please don't flame me for asking	Have spent multiple weekends with her.  She seems like a lovely person.  Although she mentioned she is making a commitment to an intense DBT program.  She has glossed over she can get suicidal and has a personality disorder.  I did not pry.  I have some experience with Borderlines in the past.  It did not end well.  My questions are: Can DBT make someone with BPD more manageable/make them capable of having a relationship without the mirroring.  love bombing, painting black and hoovering?  <e1> I know this is not an easy question </e1>  so  <e2> please don't flame me for asking </e2> .  I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and mental health is a very personal thing to me.  My therapist told me if she said she is doing DBT, end it now.  There is no hope.  Borderlines cannot be helped.  Essentially she told me to drop her like a hot potato.  Thoughts and opinions? Again, this is a sincere post.  I like this person, but given my past experiences I am very hesitant.  Is it possible to coexist with a Borderline?
I've	Please.	I've tried to stow this every place possible.  But, like wack-a-mole, no sooner do I shove it under the bed than it. . . oh, idk jumps out of the fucking closet. I'm writing in this forum 1) in a desperate attempt to stave off texting him.  (I am trying so hard) and 2) this is the only place I feel anybody - if anyone even reads this - will understand. I miss falling asleep with him.  OMG I miss it SO MUCH. He is the only man I have ever been able to fall asleep snuggled up with AND woken up in the same position!!And snuggled is a gross understatement.  We were like 2 puzzle pieces.  It didn't matter which way we intertwined.  Every GD way felt perfect.  Was perfect. I hate this.  I want these feelings to STOP. Sometimes I just want to crumble onto the floor of my bedroom with my head on the ground and wail and weep like a banshee. I hate feeling this lost.  This lonely. Please God.  I can't text him.  Please. 
So	about?	So as many of you may know, my daughter is separated from her dbpd husband.  He has been blocked on both my daughter's and my social media.   We haven't heard from in a couple years.  Just now I noticed two likes from his uncle on Facebook photos that both his parents and I have from their wedding.  I'm  pretty sure that his family knows they are separated and it's not close to an anniversary or anything.  Is this something I should be concerned about?
Or that counselling was their idea	mental health is soooo important	I know. . . this is a BPD trait, I'm prepared for it and gotta roll with it.  You're going to get mirrored and copied.  But f*ck. . . so flipping frustrating.  My ex found a new gf and good for them while it lasts.  He's happier which means I don't deal with his toxic bull for a bit. Ffs though - the stories they tell! It's like listening to a run down of every important goal, idea or plan that you mentioned and hearing it given back to you as their idea, something they always wanted or their life goal.   <e1> Or that counselling was their idea </e1>  because  <e2> mental health is soooo important </e2> .  ?Sigh.  End rant.  Have a great night Reddit
Just	said.	Just wondering if anyone has experienced being told - more or less word by word - what you “could have said”?My pwubpd would sometimes become very frustrated with my responses (she preferred communication in text) and she would then produce a sort of script that showed me what I could have said. It seemed like she was hoping for a specific response, and when I didn’t produce it, she would reveal what I could/should have said. Looking back, it is clear to me that she wasn’t really interested in me and my opinions or views.  I was just a fantasy, and when I didn’t live up to that fantasy and fulfill her needs, she told me what I was supposed to have said. 
Is	may.	Is this a normal trait of people with BPD? I've come to realize in my marriage that my wife has always had these conditions that had to be met before anything that I wanted or needed would happen.  A couple examples:When we first got married I wanted her to go get her high school diploma (she had dropped out in high school).  She said she would if I quit smoking.  So I did, but she never went back. When our sex life was non existent she would say if you do the dishes we can have sex (as an example), so I would do the dishes and then. . . . . . .  no sex. Now I want her to go to counselling with me and it's if you don't see or talk to or talk about a certain friend, I'll go well it's been 2 months and. . . . . . . .  no progress.  Can I just expect that this trend will go on forever?I don't know for sure she has BPD (never been diagnosed) but I do have some suspicions that she may. 
Hey	this?	Hey group, just a quick one.  I've started to slowly start back up in the dating game.  But jesus christ I think literally the last 3 girls I have matched with have all come out with saying they have bpd. Is this a common thing? Am I just majorly unlucky? Suppose I should be happy they had the responsibility to be upfront about it.  But yea anyone else found this?
It’s	me.	It’s been a long journey of healing and I am glad they are out of my life. But sometimes, it creeps back onto me. The pain, the paranoia and the anger.  I wish I never let them into my life. I am grateful but angry.   I hope one day, the memories stop creeping up on me.  I hope people stop mentioning them around me.   I don’t care what is happening in their lives as long as they are far away from me. 
I’m	psychopath.	I’m sad not for losing her and the pain she caused.   I’m sad for the love that was never real, for the wasted years and deep down I’m sad knowing that the best I could do was to attract a psychopath. 
My	appreciated	My boyfriend of nearly 5 years has BPD.  We're both 23 years old.  Im a female.  He's been abusive.  Physically, mentally and once sexually.  I went two weeks without seeing him and finally caved yesterday.  I said something that made him switch.  I cant remember what I said, but he threatened to kick my car in and then proceed to go kick a bin, throw his sunglasses on the floor so hard that they smashed and screamed at me.  Im sick of this.  But I feel even more broken when I try to move on.  I dont know what to do.  Please any advice would be very much appreciated
And	suffice.	And what certain behaviors meant or what was really behind the things your pwbpd did?Internet research/googling, watching videos and reading books are immensely helpful but sometimes only a live person will suffice. 
I	depression.	I remember when I went no contact with my pwBPD she called me a coward and said I’m “running away from people who mirror [my] own issues”, she said I’m not capable of loving her. I’ve always been told I’m not emotive enough and even had a someone in the past tell me I’m a sociopath, I have a hard time moving on from her saying that I’m “running away” and how she mirrors my own problem.  I keep looking into myself trying to find the contrasts.  She used to call me arrogant and pretentious a lot, just to then be arrogant and pretentious to me.  I know it’s splitting but when I was a child I used to get called a know it all and smartass. My pwBPD had a narc father and compared me to him sometimes, she even used to call me papa. Idk this relationship has left me constantly looking into myself trying to figure out what’s wrong with me, not sure whether I have a personality disorder or I’m a BPD magnet because I have another ex I think is an upwBPD and a close friend who received BPD as an alternative diagnosis with her depression. 
“there	me”	“there is a monster living inside of me”(me: cute, haha - maybe that monster just needs a hug)“when i’m angry i just see a wall of white”(me: she can’t really mean that, she’s probably not completely aware that she can be good)“people who crossed me are dead to me”(me: no way she’s really meaning that)extremely little did i know. what are things that you ignored?edit: forgot about this one:“i once pushed my ex to a busy road.  i wanted him dead.  he first tried to assault me”
I	Lol	I get so unbelievably anxious! It’s like a flashback and I panic.  I also get afraid of how people with think of me- especially since I got married and eventually divorced quite young and fast.  I also am afraid to sound super deflective or sharing a lot of private details.  Like, I don’t want to be THAT person who bashes their ex or brings up a heavy topic. For example, my hair dresser and I have been quite close these past couple of months, I know a bit of her private stuff she’s gone through and today I actually told her I was married and divorced (she was shocked but of course was so curious).  She was super understanding, but I almost felt bad / weird for talking about how crazy it all was. . . .  maybe I’m overthinking it.  I just don’t want people to feel I am emotionally dumping, even if they ask those private questions. It’s weird, I never wanna talk about the situation (especially with those who aren’t super close to me), but today, I was like well.  I’ll answer! Lol
This	ago.	This splitting cycle the pwbpd went quiet for a few days and told me afterwards that demons were surrounding them and they’ve been reading the Bible and isolating themselves. They’ve mentioned seeing demons before but it’s the first time they’ve went completely quiet during a split cycle.  I was concerned out of fear they attempted …Normally the pwbpd ignores the demons, which they stated sometime ago. 
when we were close she placed great importance on appearance and youth and	she was so attractive she was definitely able to use the “petite, beautiful, innocent, cute” aesthetic as her primary method of getting attention	As I reach an age milestone and grapple with my own mild discomfort with no longer being particularly “young” anymore, I wondered a bit about how my person is faring. It has been years at this point since we’ve had any contact or I’ve seen her social media so who knows what her identity is now, but  <e1> when we were close she placed great importance on appearance and youth and </e1>  because  <e2> she was so attractive she was definitely able to use the “petite, beautiful, innocent, cute” aesthetic as her primary method of getting attention </e2> . As she continues to lose the “young” part of the equation, it would be pretty off-putting if she’s still doing the cutesy fawning stuff she used to.  It’s just not appealing in a woman well over 30, even if she’s attractive.  I’m curious how someone like her might handle making that transition. 
For my wife, what she wants can never be attained	she wants a strong dominant man	Setting boundaries is an advice I often hear for dealing with pwBPD, but from my personal experience this does not work.   My pwBPD lives to break down boundaries because to her it’s a personal attack and another obstacle to gain control.   Everything becomes a battle for survival.   Maintaining barriers is exhausting.   Being with someone with BPD is a constant battle, even in times of peace it is a game of mutually assured destruction. The only way to satisfy them is complete selfless sacrifice of your life and even then they will cast you aside without sympathy.    <e1> For my wife, what she wants can never be attained </e1>  because  <e2> she wants a strong dominant man </e2> , but will fight tooth and nail for control.   And once you give her this control she will no longer respect you and will hold you in contempt for your perceived weakness.   It is a battle that cannot be won. And most unfortunately, admitting that there’s something wrong is also something she cannot do because it would mean taking responsibility for her actions and that’s a perceived battle she’s determined not to lose. 
I	TIA.	I see a lot of people saying they blame themselves and ruminate over what they did wrong or could have done or whatever. .  I'm self loathing hard four days post what I assume is final discard and thinking of everything I could have done differently.  Telling myself it wasn't my fault isn't enough. . .  My brain (I also have OCD) says nope. .  It was you. . .  If you'd just been a bit more chill in the moment (aka not stood up for myself/put up with horrid behaviour).  So I thought it would help to see if there are parallels with what you all obsess over having done differently/blame yourselves for.  I'm hoping it will ease my anxious mind.  TIA. 
Hello,	com/jfe/form/SV_cXXHQncRoKEhbBr	Hello, i am studying psychology and i would be so grateful to take part in my study, i know it can be hard to open up sometimes but it is completely anonymous.  I am trying to help people who take care people with personality disorders. As part of my final project in the course of Psychology in University of Greenwich I am investigating the experiences of caregivers who are taking care of people with personality disorders.  If you are a caregiver of a person who has a personality disorder, you are aware of the diagnosis of the person that you are taking care of and you take care of them for at least one year, I would be grateful if you could take part on my study.  It lasts approximately 15 minutes and you will need to answer to 7 questions in an online survey. The information will be confidential and destroyed at the end of the Academic year (June-October 2021). Thank you.  eu. qualtrics. com/jfe/form/SV_cXXHQncRoKEhbBr
I now absolutely hate myself for being	open about doing the exam and even letting her back into my life in the first place	So, today. . .  I felt a massive level of joy and accomplishment.  I've completed my first ever university exam and my first exam since high school (I did Open University, so didn't have exams in first year). Unfortunately, that feeling of elation, excitement and joy was ruined by mum exploding at me with all of the rage and stress she could find.  She went from congratulating me on completing my first uni exam ever to complaining and raging in a heartbeat and she won't look at any other options to solve the problem.  <e1> I now absolutely hate myself for being </e1>  so  <e2> open about doing the exam and even letting her back into my life in the first place </e2> . I'm not telling her if I passed.  She has ruined one of my most important accomplishments in my life (aside from recovering from BPD).  She seems to have symptoms of BPD but will never go to a therapist.  Ever. 
I understood a lot of where they come from	the relationship I had with my mother even though mine seemed a lot less abusive than the ones they experienced	I actually found this from another place called raisedbyborderlines (I posted there once without seeing the disclaimer that people with bpd aren't allowed to post.  Oops.  Im new to Reddit) and I read a lot of what they had to say. . .   <e1> I understood a lot of where they come from </e1>  because of  <e2> the relationship I had with my mother even though mine seemed a lot less abusive than the ones they experienced </e2> .  My real thing is. . . reading what they were saying just sort of blew me away by how much hatred I felt coming off them.  It makes me real hesitant to think of having kids of my own.  I was on the fence but I believe that's changed if the most common experience people have with borderline parents are negative ones.  Have any of you also experienced something similar?
does	that	does anyone else ever think “well it wasn’t that deep” when someone notices recent cuts on ur arm or when u think about or see other people scars online ur like…. .  damn i could have cut deeper why didn’t i? like is that fucked up? i mean i know it is but idk why i feel like….  i guess jealous of others cuts ? like it’s….  so weird idk .  hate that
i just can’t do it anymore	i don’t know what to do and i don’t know what i did	my fp goes through phases where they don’t talk to anyone and it’s really triggered me.  and usually i can cope with it but it’s been 4 days and they have been talking and hanging out with people while they’re supposed to be going through this not talking to anyone phase.  and it makes me so angry and lonely it makes me feel physically sick.  does anyone know how to cope with this? because  <e1> i just can’t do it anymore </e1>   <e2> i don’t know what to do and i don’t know what i did </e2> . 
I'm not quite sure I'm demisexual	I recently learned the term	 <e1> I'm not quite sure I'm demisexual </e1> , as  <e2> I recently learned the term </e2> .

Been	alone	Been up for hours thinking so much about evil shit to do to the next woman my husband gets after me (on the verge of divorce because of my affairs) I want him be happy I just dont want another woman around my kids.  I've never been this type of person before but Im also feeling so vindictive about him finding someone new, I keep having thoughts of harming myself just to release some of this evil I am feeling.  Im still trying to figure out what my BPD does to me, sometimes I feel good and other times I feel like Im really going crazy.  Im feeling like harming myself would make these thoughts and feelings go away.  Sorry If this makes no sense my head is all over the place.  Anyone else ever have evil thoughts about things that haven't even happened yet? I feel alone
i get so mad	all of these years of lost hope and pain come rushing back to meFuck therapists	For almost 10 years ive suffered so much, and have so many bad therapists, and admitted to a horrible ER, that now i cant even think about therapy without crying and hating myself and everyone around me.

Every time I get a message from someone I feel pressure and that I will let them down or discourage themIt's quite annoying	someone may think that I'm just ignoring them	Do you also feel anxious about replying to someone's message? especially private, when the contact is limited to 1:1 (it's a little better to write back on a group where there are more people and the contact is not so personal)  <e1> Every time I get a message from someone I feel pressure and that I will let them down or discourage themIt's quite annoying </e1> , because  <e2> someone may think that I'm just ignoring them </e2> , when I'm really thinking about it intensely and in the end sometimes I write back after a month How to deal with this irrational behavior?
I am fighting this diagnosis	I don’t want the stigma attached to labeling myself as someone with a borderline personality	I was recently diagnosed with BPD in a treatment environment while seeking support for substance abuse issues.   <e1> I am fighting this diagnosis </e1>  because  <e2> I don’t want the stigma attached to labeling myself as someone with a borderline personality </e2> , but I have experienced all the symptoms within the last few days multiple times a day.  I don’t have insurance anymore because I can’t hold down a job for more than like two months without thinking everyone fucking hates me there.  Then I quit with no notice, leave the area, and the cycle begins again.  Any suggestions on where to start getting help? Has anyone in this sub overcome the symptoms of bpd and gone on to live a successful life?
My	her.	My wife has untreated BPD and she refuses to take her medication because it makes her feel like she's not herself.  Everyday is a bad day and small things are taken to the extreme.  I've tried my best to reassure her and sometimes it works but she's breaking me down.  I don't know what else to do, I don't know how else to help her and keep myself from fading.   <e1> I can't express how I feel to her </e1>  because  <e2> she takes it as a personal attack </e2>  and either gets aggressive or depressed.  When she has a really bad episode she gets violent and doesn't remember any of it.  Does anyone have advice on what I can do? I am deeply in love with my wife and I can't leave her. 
I	BPD!!!!	I really don't want to go through this again.  Am I just reading in too much of my bf behavior or am I just have anxiety and fear of abandonment and being alone again.  I feel he has changed his emotions towards me, doesn't pick up the phone anymore, he cut our conversation short and he didn't even feel like he wanted to talk.  I'm hurting so bad inside and the pain is unbearable.  I feel like letting him go because I'm just not good enough.  I want him to be happy and I'm not the one to do it.  I'm just going to be pushing him away everytime I feel like he's going to leave me.  At this point it's not about is he cheating its when is he leaving.  He told me that everything is fine and for me to relax.  I don't know how to take that.   I could be having an episode and this may run its course but it's so emotionally draining ?  I hate BPD!!!!
It's	understand	It's been suggested that I probably have BPD by a few people, one being a previous therapist, and what scares me is that I think they may very well be right and I have no clue what to do with that information.  But my roommate, who I care deeply for just randomly kicked me out without any heads up and I think I broke, I'm generally the one who cuts people out of my life before they can hurt me so it was shocking and has been very painful.  One of the reasons they gave was that I'm manipulative, when I've tried so hard not to be, and I feel really confused but they said the fact that I'm doing it without knowing it is probably further evidence of the potential diagnosis.  And I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking for by posting here, I think I just need someone to understand
hi	.	hi guys!! i recently got diagnosed with bpd and i was wondering if you could go through manic episodes as a borderline? and if so,, how do they look like? and how do you become self aware during one? i was diagnosed in a ward and then i stopped going to psychotherapy so i feel kinda lost? it’s almost like someone put a label on me and i’m not sure what exactly is attached to the meaning//not understanding what i’m going through etc etc,, thank you so much. . 
As	Un-react.	As I practice my morning meditation and review my gratitude list a thought pops into my brains. “What if you’re not?”It’s an exercise in humility.  I must always remember where I come from - what brought me here to this moment. It’s a twist of fate, an ultimate irony to recognize that I would not be sitting here quietly listening to the morning birds, feeling the sunrise, and enjoying this simplistic peace had I not had a reason to slow down and let my self just be in the moment.  From the horrors I have lived through because of my disorder I now add it to my list of things to be grateful for. It reminds me that I am. It keeps me in check in the hopes that today will be a better day than yesterday and that at this very moment I slowed down just enough to listen. Breathe.  Observe.  Un-react. 
My	die.	My self harming got worse.  I‘m so disconnected from myself I don’t even feel pain anymore.  I want it to hurt, I want to know that I’m alive.  I have an eating disorder, I have several addictions, I self harm.  I manipulate my life.  It feels like I deserve it and sometimes I’m able to ignore those emotions but if they get trough I am I afraid I’ll die. 
That triggered me so much	I wasn’t loved in my childhood	Idk if you guys had seen my other post, but I got into a fight with my ex boyfriend and he said that se doesn’t love me anymore.   <e1> That triggered me so much </e1> , since  <e2> I wasn’t loved in my childhood </e2> , anything that involves love makes me go crazy.  So that frase made me lose my mind and thinking that i would never be loved, so again I tried to kill myself.  I really don’t know how to tell all of this to my therapist, it’s been six years since my last attempt, she was saying that she was proud of me for being able to recover after all these years of suffering and now i’m ashamed to tell her that I relapse.  What you guys think I should do?
i	)	i applied for a customer service position at home depot and just looking at the reddit and so many people hating it :/ i’m nervous but idk what else to do bc other jobs are too far away and i can’t drive (does anyone know what sort of jobs i should be applying for or just ur own suggestions please :) (i’m only a high school graduate btw…. )
Advice is welcome but I can't move away from this person	im disabled and we live in the same house	I can't stop crying I dyed my fps hair and they didn't like it and she told me she'll never trust me again and that I can't ever do anything to make this better and im scared she'll hear me crying and feel even worse than she already does I just want her to be happy and I feel so guilty for messing it up (she has dysphoria and wanted a very specific color, and was in a psychotic episode so don't hold her reaction against her please)  <e1> Advice is welcome but I can't move away from this person </e1>  because  <e2> im disabled and we live in the same house </e2> . 
I was very anxious	one pill got stuck the other day and that always make my anxiety go up with this	Not sure if they have BPD (there are many signs) but I just wondered if anyone here can put sone light on this specific behavior? <e1> I was very anxious </e1>  because  <e2> one pill got stuck the other day and that always make my anxiety go up with this </e2> . My ex got so angry and showed me how they do it…. In the the end I asked the nurse if I can crush the pill and she said sure.  I have also learned to push my chin to my chest that makes it easier. Anyways why do some people get so mad if another is unable to do something that is easy for them.  I didn’t ask them for help.  They just couldn’t bare to watch me struggle and I also got zero empathy. 
I've wasted a decade	my BP, depression, and anxiety	I've always known since I was a teen that there was something about my thoughts and feelings that weren't the norm but didn't know how to put it into words.  I guess I was afraid of being vulnerable and just hoped it would go away.  <e1> I've wasted a decade </e1>  because of  <e2> my BP, depression, and anxiety </e2> .  There's so much I missed out on and could've done.  Making decisions like college, romantic relationships, friendships, hobbies, etc.  Instead I just ate and ate my feelings away and suppressed my mental illness until I hit rock bottom in 2020.  I finally got help, but now I'm starting to think about everything I missed out on. I'm 25 and feel like I'm starting life as a new person.  I feel like it's almost remorse for the past and the life I could have been living by now if I had gotten help sooner. 
Alert	breakdown	Alert Alert, FP abandoning me.  But not really.  But it feels like that.  Ahhhhhhhhh. He’s an international student.  We’ve dated for a year during covid lockdown, but now that restrictions are lifting, he can go back to his home country.  He’s going to spend the entire summer there.  And I’m gonna miss him like crazy. Everything about him I am going to miss.  Fuck.  How am I gonna survive? I’m seriously afraid of being without him.  He’s who I turn to for comfort and cuddles and just everything.  He’s my everything (hearing the BPD as I type this aha). .  I know I must learn to be without him, but I just don’t want to. I really hope I don’t go into a whole breakdown
I	?	I wonder if you guys also got distracted easily? Even when not dissociating? Well actually I don’t even know if I’m dissociating all the time ? it’s confusing, but i can get distracted pretty easily.  For example : I was watching Netflix, then someone messaged me.  I paused the movie.  And after i replied it, i ended up opening instagram or twitter,etc.  and before i knew it, 2 hours has passed ?
I was working as a junior web developer before quitting my job	I wasn’t sure if I enjoyed sitting in my room alone coding all day	I just started a new job working as an ABA therapist with kids and I’ve been crying really hard at work at least once a week.  The job is certainly rewarding but I am so overwhelmed.   <e1> I was working as a junior web developer before quitting my job </e1>  because  <e2> I wasn’t sure if I enjoyed sitting in my room alone coding all day </e2> .  I felt lonely all the time.  But now I am completely overwhelmed.  I don’t know what to do.  I’m thinking about going back to my old job to save my mental health, but I’m going to feel guilty if I bail on the kids.  I’m just tired of crying so much and so hard, so often. 
I	others.	I have this bad habit of saying things like I’m pathetic, or I’m a burden.  I also say that I screw up things by being psycho.  I’m writing this post as a personal and public reminder that no matter what you have done, how you have acted, or what you’ve said - you’re still worthy of love.  Your feelings are valid and although we have certain challenges that make certain things harder, we are capable of overcoming those challenges and we are no less deserving of happiness than someone without BPD.  We’ve all experienced emotional distress and deserve love + acceptance, not shame and self hatred.  I’m making the decision to love myself despite my past behavior, and to rest in the knowing that I too deserve the love, forgiveness, and compassion that I so freely give others. 
He thought I was making myself sad and that i was causing all this pain to myself	I think it makes me special	Hi! :)My name is Zen, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder two weeks ago.  Everyone has been very supportive and understanding in my family, however before I got my diagnose, my step-dad has expressed his concern regarding the validity of my feelings.   <e1> He thought I was making myself sad and that i was causing all this pain to myself </e1> , just because  <e2> I think it makes me special </e2> .  It doesn't.  Anyway, after the diagnose he apologised and said that he will support me and etc.  He handles my mental disorder in a weird way.  He doesn't really understand the concept of all of this.  So I wanted to ask, if maybe any of you could recommend some books I could give him and my mom so they could grasp some of the concept? sorry I unloaded a bit more, than was maybe neccessary, I just feel a little bit at a loss here.  I don't really know how to navigate all of this, yet everyone excepts me to help them understand it.  You know?
I broke up with her recently	I was tired of all the drama	 <e1> I broke up with her recently </e1>  bc  <e2> I was tired of all the drama </e2> .  She hit me twice and the final straw came when she flushed her meds down the toilet and then tried to lie about it.  She has now threatened to cut her wrist if I don’t take her back.  I visited her last night to check on her and she was drinking and crying.  I talked to her today and she seemed low.  She has tried to hurt herself before by crashing the car into a tree.  I took the battery out of her car last night and took all the paracetamol out of her apartment.  I’m really worried about her and want to put a stop to this insanity.  I know she is suffering and I want to help her.  I called her doctor yesterday and she has an appointment there tomorrow
I’ve	hard	I’ve started talking to someone in December, I’ve somehow become invested in this person although we haven’t been able to meet since covid and she went back to her country for a couple of months.  She said that she’s interested, but I can’t help but think she’s playing me, or just using me to pass time.  How do I stop thinking this?Also how do I stop getting mad when I see that she’s online and hasn’t responded to me yet? Or not get anxious when it’s been hours since she last replied.  It’s only an hour time difference.  Also she’s been very understanding of my crazy.  I just want to be better so that she sticks around long enough to meet me and see where we could go from there. Another thing, how do I stop thinking about me not being good enough or good looking enough for her.  My mind is a shitshow atm, so much self hate and I know it’s not attractive.  I’ve been cheated on in my last serious relationship so things are bit hard
How	people.	How many times I got told just ask for help.  You have allies.  You don't have to live through this alone.  Just talk I will listen. When they see the fancy stuff allies are quick to say they will follow in battle.  Maybe they think that battle isn't that hard, or that I'm tougher than I think. But then the battle comes.  From small talks about relationship issues and impulsivity issues, the problems the allies see go too real for them.  They see just in front of them the reckless driving, the alcohol abuse leading to the hospital, the suicidal behaviour, the neediness, the loss of any sense of self going from overly nice to hyper agressive within minutes. And suddenly in the heart of battle, the cavaly withdraws.  You are left alone fighting demons too big for you.  You thought the cavalry had your flanks, and there was a fortress you could retreat to in case things would turn bad. But the cavalry disappeared, and there never was any fortress. You are just alone, and all your allies suddenly close their doors. The more I open, the more I repell people. 
I	too?	I got diagnosed with BPD last November and for reasons I can't disclose, I can't get therapy for the time being. I have been trying to keep track of all the possible patterns that have developed as a result of my BPD and I was wondering about this : does anyone here get bored of people/things/experiences in the blink of an eye? Like, for instance, I have this dying urge to talk to my boyfriend one second and then two seconds into the conversation I'm like I wish I could just leave.  Nothing bad happens during that conversation but I just don't feel like doing it. I have never considered myself socially awkward or anything.  I interact  when I have to.  But, my mind is extremely fickle.  This is probably why I've never had strong, long-term friendships.  Even with genuinely likeable people, I want out of conversations real quick. The same thing happens with my career choices.  I question my options pretty much every wakeful moment.  I try to dabble with a lot of things and in the process, I don't do justice to either of them. Can anyone confirm if this happens with them too?
So,	about.	So, I have in my hands a dr Daniel fox borderline personality workbook, and every time I open it, it feels like I have been punched in the gut and In the heart repeatedly.  It brings up so many bad memories and traumas to learn about BPD.  Does anyone have any advice on how to get through it? I know the information is so essential for me but it makes me sick to read and think about. 
Hi	sleep	Hi so I have been having  reckless moment with drinking and smoking really manic for a day then it goes and comes back.  My self image and trying to be liked by everyone has gone through the roof with rejection sensitivity by a group chat of friends getting worse anyway I became so intense with the group that o decided it was making me I'll so managed to force myself not to reply as much it's eased of now.  But today I actually feel normal I'm relaxed and don't care about anything that normal bothers me.  Is that normal to have periods of normality this normal happens when I have a reckless month and I just take a week off work and relax and sleep
Hi	??	Hi there,I started therapy at the age of 20, been getting help weekly for the past 12 years and feel hopeless at the idea that anything will ever change.  I’m in 12 steps recovery program for self destructive behaviors, and although everything helps a little, to just go through the day, I’m having trouble finding purpose in life. When your thoughts keep changing, how do you actually find and stick to something that will get you out of the hell you feel you’re stuck in? Deep inside, I really believe life should be wonderful despite mental health and disabilities, but I struggle with finding meaning to anything. Thoughts and experiences are welcomed ??
My	help.	My partner is diagnosed with BPD.  We do not live together but live in same city.  She is trying hard for the relationship.  But with BPD she gets angry and pushes me away for slightest of things. If you are a partner/friend of someone with BPD, what steps are you taking for yourself and your partner? What do you do when things get out of hand? Thankyou in advance Any suggestions would be of great help. 
My	answers.	My relationship is 3 years long and it’s been mostly chaotic and dramatic.  We actually do love each other.  She understands what I’m dealing with to an extent (hasn’t been to therapy with me).  I know she emotionally drained and mentally exhausted.  She doesn’t look happy.  She cries every time we fight now (a lot).  I’m really trying to change.  I just get this sad disappointing look on my face and she knows when I’m hiding it.  This can’t be good for her emotional and mental well being.  Any advice here? Like we want to be with each other.  But maybe this thing is bigger than me.  I can’t disappoint her anymore.  I can let her drag her self down to deal with my shit anymore.  Look if you think I should do it just say it I don’t need the long answers. 
i	too.	i know mood swings is one of the main traits of BPD but i can't help it but find myself strange for changing my mood so fast, i'd be relaxed/chilling in 15 mins even if i was extremely angry before.  i think this whole switch thing can be scary for others around me too. 
Hello!	well.	Hello! I am fairly certain I have BPD due to various reasons but I don't want to self diagnose.  I will be officially getting a diagnosis ASAP.  However that's not the point of this post.  I want to try DBT.  I've been going to therapy for almost a year now, and my therapist works with the gestalt method.  In my country there aren't any therapists who do DBT and there aren't any GOOD therapists who do CBT either.  From what I've read, DBT is the best option for BPD.  I want to try DBT in order to get pass my self sabotaging tendencies which have been bugging me for some time now.  I found the workbook online in PDF form and I want to get started.  Do you think it's a good idea if I start DBT on my own? If any on you have been doing this without the help of a licensed therapist please tell me your experience/journey and give me some tips. What are your experiences with DBT? Also, if any of you do gestalt therapy, please share me your experience as well. 
My husband has become depressed	he can't help me	Is there anyone who has had meds actually help with bpd? I feel like I'm not getting better with two different meds.  I'm angry at the world, I'm insecure in relationships and in my own skin.  I feel like no one likes me.  My husband is trying to help me, but I can't find who I use to be.  I use to have confidence and now I'm filled with fears including driving.  I moved somewhere and feel completely isolated.   <e1> My husband has become depressed </e1>  because  <e2> he can't help me </e2> .  Now even when he's home, he's not really present.  I think he may give up on me soon or maybe I will. 
Let	nurse.	Let me preface this by saying that going to a psych ward is still a hugely stigmatized thing in my country. I spent 6 weeks at a psych ward and came back roughly a week ago.  One of the things bothering me is how I'm perceived now. So far, I've been told a few things:My partner's family was reportedly supportiveMy partner's family friends now think I'm psycho. The information where I was was likely leaked to my professional circles by one of my friends, which is not great and might cause me to resign, should this theory prove true. I've asked my partner to try and explain what BPD is to his family friends.  So far, I'm sure he hadn't spoken to them at all.  In their mind, he should pick a normal woman, atleast that's how they tend to think.  Why they think that way is beyond me, since one of them is a nurse. 
Someone	spiral.	Someone I used to work with just sent me a picture of someone asking for my nudes (my picture and first and last name) on a revenge porn site.  I couldn't stop crying at first but now I just feel sad and gross.  They also called me a slut in the post and I'm just falling down the spiral. 
And	learning	And tho it isn’t the first person with BPD I’ve met, I am worried about what the disorder means.  They very openly told me, and I shared I have bipolar disorder.  She told me a few symptoms she has like zoning out when shit hits the fan, not wanting a relationship for reasons. I looked up what not to say to someone like this; it seemed very common sense to me. I’m worried about drama.  I hate drama I’ve had enough already; and I don’t know if I’m being unfair , but what are some of the patterns you know a person with BPD may display upon meeting someone néw?For what it’s worth we’re both gay women but I dont think we’re interested in each other.  I’m 32 she’s 34.  She’s very nice and the conversation was pleasant and funny.  I like her so far, I’ve just had betrayal before from people without personality disorders (I think. . ) and I’m not looking to get hosed all of a sudden. Thank you, I’m sorry if I came off insensitive.  Still learning
I	pls??	I wake up everyday with the fear of losing my familly.  i spend to WHOLE DAY terrorized.  To me every loud noise i hear outside is either one of them got hit by car or idk some horrible accident happened to them. .  And i cant make it stop it's killing me, im afraid they'll all leave me alone.  Any help pls??
I’ve	loooool	I’ve been on quetiapine for two months, 100mg for three weeks, I’ve just taken my dose for tonight and . . .  I feel like I’ve just snorted an entire baggy of coke.  I usually don’t feel anything and then it knocks me out when I’m asleep, but tonight my pupils are masssssive, I have sheds loads of energy, like I’m literally pinging.  Has this happened to anyone else? It’s literally three in the morning and I’m off my nut in my flat alone loooool
Anyone	me	Anyone super sensitive to music? I feel like it influences my moods so intensely.  I can go from happy to crying within seconds if the music notes and lyrics are “deep”.  usually with songs written by the performer, maybe part of an empathetic thing? relating to pain in a variety of ways makes it easy to feel their pain? i just notice it a lot while watching tv.  if there’s a scene or commercial with emotional music i immediately choke up.  happy music does it too, but i’ve noticed i’m more-so influenced by sad music than other people around me
I'm	cease.	I'm sorry for the chaotic title.  All people who learn about me being in a clinic few months ago after an attempt get worried and tell me just talk to me when you feel down.  It's almost like they all just planned with each other to tell me this exact same phrase.  They tell me bs like suicide is not a solution.  Everybody will get sad.  You'll tear holes in hearts of those who love you. But when it comes to actually acting and doing literally anything with me, they just don't.  At this point I feel like a pet.  Being held against my own will, just to cheer up some brat.  They don't want me to feel good, they just want me alive to make them feel good.  They don't care how I'm feeling.  They only care that I'm there so that their selfish desire of being a good human is sated. I don't want to be a pet.  I don't want to feel anything.  I don't want to be ashamed of my emotions.  I just want it all to cease. 
I	please!!!	I have finally found the most amazing medication combo and holy heck this is the happiest I’ve been in my entire damn life.  Almost 26 years of endless suffering, it’s finally over.  I cried 4 days ago just from happy I’ve been.  I no longer hear voices, no longer see things that aren’t there, my anger has improved by 80%, My awareness, literally everything has improved.  My roommates have even noticed it and comment on it all the time.  Don’t ever give up please!!!
I feel like there’s no hope for anyone seeing me as anything but bad	there is so much misinformation being spread by people without BPD labeled as factual and the truth	This page had so much stigma. . .  it is meant to educate those who are in the life of someone with BPD and instead all it is is a stigma-fest.  I felt so sad and heartbroken reading all the hate.  I feel like i’m an evil person now,  <e1> I feel like there’s no hope for anyone seeing me as anything but bad </e1>  because  <e2> there is so much misinformation being spread by people without BPD labeled as factual and the truth </e2> . I was multiple people saying those with BPD move on quickly and the comments were so disgusting.  It was just tons of people tearing apart people with BPD. .  I don’t move on quickly, in fact all of my exes have moved on before I did.  I take so long to get over people. How do I stop letting people who only believe stigma and spread it, get to me?
I want to get better	my mental health is impacting all the relationships in my life as well as my education	I have been struggling with my mental health for over a decade now, and I’m not doing much better than I was years ago.  I always look at my progress and feel a sense of disappointment because well, nothing seems to change.  I never could understand why though? I thought I was permanently broken.  I’ve realized that you can’t get better unless you actually want yourself too, you have to work for it and actually want it.  But I have this ridiculous idea in my head that I’m supposed to be sad.  It’s become my comfortable place.  Being happy seems foreign.  This is how I’m supposed to be, isn it? It’s like I TRY to be sad.  Maybe so people notice me? Maybe so I feel heard? Maybe so I get that little piece of attention I’m lacking? I don’t know.   <e1> I want to get better </e1> , because  <e2> my mental health is impacting all the relationships in my life as well as my education </e2> .  If I’m going to be happy, I have to let go of being sad.  And despite all my years in therapy and on meds, I really can’t seem to figure out how. 
Does	that?	Does anyone else ever have the sudden urge to scream? You’re not upset or depressed about anything, you just want to scream.  You can feel it in your chest and you have to make some type of noise to make it go away? I’ve had this since I was a kid. I should add I also do have severe OCD could this be tied into that?
I constantly find myself walking away from things and people that make me happy	I hate myself so much that i think i don't deserve to be around them	 <e1> I constantly find myself walking away from things and people that make me happy </e1>  because  <e2> I hate myself so much that i think i don't deserve to be around them </e2> .  I don't know how to tell myself otherwise. 
I	advice?	I know this is a bit vague but whenever I’m in an argument with someone that knows I have borderline I feel invalidated because they think my emotions rule my life (they do) but I’m not stupid.  When I get mad about something it’s true, sometimes I over react, but I just want people to take me seriously.  Does anyone have any advice?
It’s been 4 days and I’m struggling really bad	I want to talk to him	It took everything I had to but I told my FP that their inconsistent behavior and manipulation was too much for me and I was done. He would love bomb me for a couple of days or weeks with Facetimes or hangouts.  He’d tell me how cute I am and that he wants to be more than friends but then he would disappear for days or sometimes weeks.  I tried previously to explain the inconsistency made me anxious and he told me that I overwhelmed him by expressing that feeling. But on Monday I told him I was done.   <e1> It’s been 4 days and I’m struggling really bad </e1>  because  <e2> I want to talk to him </e2>  but I needed to end it and stand up for myself.  He was using me for sex or nudes and knew if he love bombed me every so often that I would be there inevitably for him.  However, he was never there for me. I’m proud of myself for ending things but I keep second guessing it at the same time. 
Seriouly,	people	Seriouly, I'm scared shitless to spend time with people because I'm afraid that my fragile sense of self will crumb for little things and realize that I'm so different and crazy than most people
I	pretend??	I always feel so out of place unless I’m completely alone.  sometimes with my two close friends I’ll feel normal and not even aware of thinking that I could be fake, but then it’ll just hit me that I’m not like everyone else and everything I do is weird, even if it’s not weird I just feel like it is and that everyone’s aware of it.  When I’m at school, sitting in class I feel like I have to sit a certain way or have a certain posture so ppl don’t realize that I’m “off”.  It’s really hard to explain but it happens all the time whenever I’m in public and idk is it ‘normal’ to feel like you’re always pretending or have to pretend??
Granted	together.	Granted I don't have an fp at all right now.  And I know that shows progress.  But I can't help but feel guilty that he isn't my fp since my abusive ex was my fp while we were together. 
I	ok)	I have those quick flash of ending my life or the desire to do so 5-10 times a day. I'm not actually depressed.  I'm pretty happy about where I am right now.  But these quick light flash come to me from 2 to 3 times a day to 10 times when I'm having worst days. Any of you experience something similar? (No need to contact suicide emergency or anything.  I'm ok)
Isn't	others?	Isn't that funny how some treatments for BPD are considered to 'reduce the risk of suicide'??? if the quality of life is still as miserable as without the treatment, do i have to keep living for the sake of living? For others?
I worry that that wears on them too much	I deal with some pretty heavy stuff on a daily basis	I will go through periods where I am perfectly fine and content with the relationships in my life.  But there are occasional periods of time where I convince myself that my friends, coaches, doctors, and therapist hate me.  It creates a lot of fear in my mind and I really begin to self isolate and it makes it so much harder to reach out when I'm experiencing SI/SIB.  I just think that they all hate me for being a terrible person and relying too much on them. I am a very open person and am willing to share a lot of information about myself to my friends and  <e1> I worry that that wears on them too much </e1>  because  <e2> I deal with some pretty heavy stuff on a daily basis </e2> . Is this a normal thing to experience and how do you deal with it?
these	anymore	these past few months have been exceptionally difficult.  for about 5 days, I'd be super down and depressed.  then it takes me 2 weeks to recover and catch up.  and then I have 1 week of feeling like a normal person. . .  but then the cycle repeats. i'm so tired of falling, and getting up, only to fall again.  its like I'm doomed from the start.  i have extremely important final exams coming up and i can barely function. i don't know what to do anymore
I	again.	I have that kind of wish like more than 10 years.  It is so fearsome to be abandoned.  I already got abandoned by my wife(she commit suicide 1 year ago). I fear to get in or try to be construct serious relationships with others.  I fear that they will refuse me and go away.  And the fear that i will not satisfied with that relationship. My heart feels so numb.  I just want to be loved once again. 
The	again.	The only reason I have survived Reddit is because it’s different from other social media.   I loose my shit on social media for some reason.   I can’t have a friend online either.   All of my FPs (accept for one) have been online and it always ended in disaster.   My last FP was an online friendship and we just never video chatted or even had a phone call.   I felt so disconnected from her.   It made it so much easier to take everything she said with a grain of salt.   At some point, everything she said to me felt disingenuous.   I realized that it’s always been that way with online friendships.   I am never having one again. 
It's 2 different situations now & I'm writing this while crying	honestly it ticked me off	Well, hello, it's me again. .  <e1> It's 2 different situations now & I'm writing this while crying </e1>  because  <e2> honestly it ticked me off </e2> . . But let's start this post with a good thing.  My fp told me I'm his best friend.  Do you have any ide-- oh yeah, y'all do.  THE REASSURANCE.  That is not one-sided.  The actual warmth of having it said back to you as well.  & At the same time, the insecurities of 'he might not mean it/he's taking things slightly'. But since the weather/ memory is good, I'll most likely cherish that for a littler while. Now, the bad thing from today. .  Today, earlier, my friends & I went to sterilize our cats.  There's this friend to whom I'm really really close.  She's got a boyfriend & they have a good relationship.  However today he was kinda angry/ stressed & it changed the mood in the car.  So my friend was kinda anxious about his weather.  The morning went 'normal' & then we went back to their house.  I felt betrayal & here is why:
He's	over.	He's constantly coming over when I'm on reddit, he knows my username, but I know nothing of his reddit and it really is irritating and he closes windows on me.  Today was supposed to be our day but he waited till the last flipping day to do taxes and now I won't see him for another four hours.  I'm worried he's cheating on me and my wise mind will not take over. 
My	.	My (more or less only) friend mentioned that he used to talk to this woman online but she unfortunately disappeared for a long time.  She also has BPD by the way.  A few days ago he seemed to find her and now every time he doesn't reply to me I'm thinking that they might have started talking again and he doesn't really want to talk to me anymore (we talk only online due to distance).  Even writing this down I realise how stupid this might sound and I should know better at my age but seems like I don't.  I'm terrified that he might stop talking to me, I wouldn't survive.  I need to make more friends but I usually get attached to one to whom I feel like I can tell anything. . . 
I	out.	I feel like it helps not having to discern and analyze a person's voice and body language, as well as give me a minute to think about a response rather than just blurting out a response ?I feel way more comfortable messaging someone, especially if it's an important or deep talk.  I'm less likely to say something I regret or get a barrage of  what do you mean by that ?  And feel too overwhelmed trying to think how to rephrase something that I start freaking out. 
Adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or any mental illness that causes severe functional impairment are eligible now, whatever their age	they are at greater risk from the virus	According to this NHS England blog people with Severe Mental Illness are now eligible for our covid vaccines. ‘If you or a loved one you care for have a Severe Mental Illness (SMI), you are eligible for a free NHS COVID-19 vaccination now.  <e1> Adults with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or any mental illness that causes severe functional impairment are eligible now, whatever their age </e1> , because  <e2> they are at greater risk from the virus </e2> . ’‘GP teams are encouraged to keep prioritising people with mental illness, applying a flexible approach to defining SMI.  For instance, this could include people who are severely unwell with an eating disorder (who have a high or low BMI), or a diagnosis of personality disorder. ’I’m calling my GP surgery tomorrow to ask if I’m on any kind of waiting list or if I’ve been missed off because I sure would like to have my vaccine ASAP!Hope this is is helpful to anyone here!
Ugh	it	Ugh I can’t take being left on read.  I HATE it.  It makes me feel sooo shitty and down especially if I’m feeling lonely and desperate to talk to someone.  Idk.  It sucks so bad and idk how to get over it.  I just stay on the messenger or keep checking it
TW:	depressed.	TW: self harm, disordered eating, me on stage In really short shortsI went on stage looking like an Adonis with self harm scars covered in fake tan! After struggling with eating three meals a day and regularly going 72 hours without eating I trained hardcore for 3 months to look amazing on stage!!! All of my friends were so proud of me and I never felt like more of a rockstar in my life. Unfortunately despite the fact that this is the hardest I worked towards anything I didn’t manage to place in the top 5 which was so disheartening for the first three days but to see so many people congratulate me and be proud of me was so worth it. me with an edited out face because I’m scared imgur. com/br9WWL6. jpgI’ll probably upload my actual face in an edit but for now that’s my progress.  I can’t believe I went from someone who didn’t eat and was underweight to this.  I’m thankful for a good support network but I still have so much work to do, I still regularly feel so intense and depressed. 
The	myself.	The only thing I feel proud about myself is my music.  It's my biggest accomplishment in life, despite just being an amateur.  I do music for fun.  I'm not trying to self advertise.  I just want someone to listen to my stuff and reassure me that I'm not totally untalented worthless like I think.  Vicio is a concept album about mental illness and substance abuse and relapse and depression, despite having no lyrics.  The name of the songs have their hidden meanings.  And the structure of songs is on purpose, the repetitiveness, it represents overdoses or psychosis or depression. Please don't delete, be nice, I'm begging, I need some reassurance, feeling like offing myself. 
it seems rather centric to women in a field	routinely focuses on women for diagnosis, ignoring borderline men	there’s a lot of memes and such titled with “BorderlineBarbie”.  where did it come from? why’s it so common to see here?i’m not shitting on anyone who uses it, it’s fine, but i suppose i’m asking because i dislike it a lot.   <e1> it seems rather centric to women in a field </e1>  that  <e2> routinely focuses on women for diagnosis, ignoring borderline men </e2>  (who have killed themselves and is revealed to have BPD in autopsy).  Maybe i’m just being a whiny guy; i’m not sure, so i’m asking for a check on that too. Again, i’m not against anyone using the phrase, people who like it definitely should.  do what makes you happy lol, it’s not hurting anyone.  i’m wondering where it came from, and why people like the phrase?
This	?	This is a verbatim text from someone I’ve just met and got along with well.  I thought it was an interesting choice of words.  I think I do mind.  I think I’ve already skipped ahead to the part where they figure out their life is simpler without me in it.  I can’t even figure out how to respond to their messages all of a sudden.  I’m completely frozen, dissociated and exhausted.  What.  The.  Fuck.  Even.  Is.  This. UPDATE: afraid I have a stalker on my hands ?
Just	perspectives	Just like as someone else w bpd?I think i like her for the most part but there is so much about her that does not align with the way i am (almost like we are 2 different people that are more than just our diagnoses lol) but i was just curious to hear different perspectives
I lean towards melancholy for the most part with bursts of other emotions	take me on those excursions for a while	I'm sure many of you have a place you go that is your cocoon, your realm, the place through the wardrobe that makes you feel surrounded by calm.  For me, that's Autumn.  I love Autumn, especially October which to me is the greatest of months.  Everything starts to get ready for winter but not just yet.  It starts getting cooler.  The leaves begin to change color yet are still hanging on to the branches - not quite ready to let go.  There are cloudy days where I can sit with the window open and watch the overcast world and listen to Jazz music that fits the mood so well. Admittedly,  <e1> I lean towards melancholy for the most part with bursts of other emotions </e1>  that  <e2> take me on those excursions for a while </e2> .  But my comfort zone, the place where I am right now even though it's Spring, is Autumn.  I'm listening to Jazz right now and daydreaming about a nice October day. 
Like	?	Like when asked to make a vision board or write down things you like/dislike about yourself and tear it up to  overcome  it. They always make me feel so stupid and I'm not quite sure of how to put it into words. I also feel kind of dumb when people try to ground me.  Like I was having a panic attack and was given the  5 things you can see, four things you can hear . . .   and it didn't really help my mindset just took my mind off the crying. Does anyone else feel this way or know what's up with that ?
empty	doomed	empty lost like a mentally ill freak who will never fix their life like im doomed
I'm	Peace!	I'm curious because I have trauma and I just freaking  cry at everything and want to know if this is a BPD thing or not.  Peace!
i’m thinking it’s just common	my mental illnesses like depression and anxiety	Does anyone have really scary episodes of derealization and depersonalization? i struggle with depersonalization because of my depression, i just go like numb almost and sometimes i don’t feel anything.  i’m just therei often feel feelings of derealization that come along with a horrible sense of self and identity.  i have no idea who i am sometimes and sometimes my mind goes blank and i have just like horrible memory often as well. is anyone else like this?  <e1> i’m thinking it’s just common </e1>  because of  <e2> my mental illnesses like depression and anxiety </e2> .  (idk if this is common with bpd but it’s included in the symptoms, i’m just undiagnosed)it could be something else but i’m not sure really so i’m just curious as to if anyone else experiences this?
He doesn't want to name the relationship	what he has faced while trying to handle me	Idk what to do I'm 30.  Have BPD.  But I'm on medication and therapy.  But of late, I've been feeling very useless and angry.  I can control it.  Thanks to my therapy and meds.  But can't shake off the feeling.  The pandemic has hit hard and I don't have a job.  I live alone.  My parents are helping me out with the money for now.  I only have one friend in the city.  I don't know anyone else.  We are kind of in an on and off kind of situation.  We used to date.  But have been together for 5 years.   <e1> He doesn't want to name the relationship </e1>  because of  <e2> what he has faced while trying to handle me </e2> .  I feel like I'm losing him.  He shuts me off from his friends and family.  My work is going nowhere.  I don't have any savings.  I feel like I should fight and blame everyone for how they have made me feel I feel so helpless
basically	do?	basically i go out of my way to my jokes and shit to make sure everyone is happy and if i don’t, people think im upsetbut if im too annoying, people get mad at meso then what do i do?i have enough issues regulating my emotions and i know its not my job to regulate for others but its literally ingrained in what people think of me that if im not laughing or cracking jokes then something’s wrongtldr: made too many jokes and now a colleague is mad at me what do i do?
its	lmao	its not like i hope the worst for people but they could complain about emotional or physical problems and i couldn’t care less lol and other times are okay but sometimes when people complain to me i get irritated for whatever reason lol is being selfish or apathetic one of the effects of bpd lmao
Especially	worse.	Especially when things are going well.  It's like I thrive off of being miserable and constantly want to do something to make myself feel worse. 
I	disorder?	I dated him for two or three months.  He wasnt taking me out or spending holidays with me.  But was happy to see me every Thursday.  After dropping alot of hints that I wanted to spend time with him, he instead went out with his friends.  I just told him that my needs arent being met.  And we should keep looking.  He only responded with sorry hes out with the guys.  Now im sitting here, thinking I have a disorder, is it my disorder or me? I deserve to be with someone or even be thought of, during holidays.  How do people with BPD know the difference if its them or disorder?
I've	party!	I've been listening to the silenced inner voice that my teenaged self had, the one that said its not okay to treat me like this and this family isn't right.  I've behaved in a borderline manner under duress as an adult but I also know that I was reacting as a sensitive person dealing with being conditioned by insanity.  I wonder at what point we cross from fleas to BPD.  What have you learned? How do you feel about it? How's the recovery/ learning healthy coping mechanisms going?Let's have a little uplifting party!
Okay	.	Okay so I volunteer at a mental health group and the lead facilitator was talking about stuff that was triggering my ptsd.  We had a chat over the phone and I discussed how we can’t really talk about that stuff, everything was fine over the phone and since then I’ve been given the cold shoulder. .  This has now happened a couple of times and it’s starting to really p*ss me off. .  more at myself, how I used to allow people to just walk all over me.  There’s that inner part of me that wants to apologise but I have nothing to be sorry for and I’m in this constant battle with myself.  I’m glad I have a partner and family that understand me, I just wish some of my friends did too. . 
I feel anxious and sad	I can’t find my friend or get ahold of her	This last week I have had lucid dreams every night about the event that triggered my ptsd.  3 years ago I found my bestfriend after she ended her life which has affected all facets of my life.  I am never afraid or traumatized in my dreams, but  <e1> I feel anxious and sad </e1>  because  <e2> I can’t find my friend or get ahold of her </e2> .  Last night was the closest dream to the actual event so far.  I feel it is strange that I’m suddenly dreaming about her every night so many years later, but at the same time I recognize I think about her all day. Does anyone else have consistent calm dreams of the event that caused their ptsd?
I then start panicking more	the 12-step fellowship I once belonged to classified these delusions as me being egotistical	I've been having the worst episodes I've had since I left my abuser in 2016 (I am a domestic violence survivor. ) Lately the amount of stress that's been put upon me (grad school program and unexpected medical emergency requiring surgery) has made my symptoms take a turn for the worse.  I'm experiencing symptoms that I haven't experienced before; including some delusion-like ones.  I have very persecutory delusions about the people in my life and those around me - as if they all think the way my abuser did.  It's extremely distressing, scary, and I've been having 5-6 panic attacks per day.  When I'm having these episodes I am convinced that people are ultra critical of everything I am doing, how wrong I am for doing them, they are thinking to themselves how much of a piece of shit I am and they are talking about me behind their backs.   <e1> I then start panicking more </e1>  because  <e2> the 12-step fellowship I once belonged to classified these delusions as me being egotistical </e2>  , which is something my abuser would say as well. Not many people understand at all.  I feel like I don't deserve anything. 
I	helpless.	I feel I’m beginning to completely break.  So many years I wore the mask of a high functioning, successful person.  Even on the bad days I found a way to push it down and suck it up.  Now I’m getting to a place where it’s all beginning to burst at the seams and I’ve become a shell of a person.  I’m afraid to spiral so far that I lose my job, relationships, etc.  I’m constantly cycling between hyper arousal (intrusive, repetitive thoughts and anxiety) and then complete dissociation, leaving me completely numb.  I just began seeing a therapist and hope we can make progress.  For many years I dealt with misdiagnosis of bipolar, putting me through a gamut of unhelpful and harmful meds, which I believe just exacerbated my problems.  Now that I have been given the PTSD diagnosis, part of me feels some sense of solace, at least having a framework to make more sense of everything I’ve been dealing with.  My traumas began at age 2; now that I’m 32 I’m finding I can no longer pretend.  I’m scared and feel helpless. 
I’m	happen.	I’m constantly afraid If I start chilling and pretend I’m safe, something awful will happen. 
Sharing	com/ideas/archive/2021/05/car-accident/618766/	Sharing this article written by a man with PTSD following car accident.  It is well written and could be helpful to send to people in your life if you want them to hear a personal account separate from your own.  My friend sent it to me, and it felt really good to me that she had read it. Warning that it could be triggering to read as he recounts two traumatic car accidents he was in.  I cried while reading but am glad I read it: theatlantic. com/ideas/archive/2021/05/car-accident/618766/
Does	much.	Does anyone know what it is? I need to calm my shit but dont want to take too much. 
I	this?	I have dream anxiety disorder on top of my PTSD and I am now getting some really horrifying dreams and I can’t differentiate between what’s real or not.  I woke up like normal and walked to the shower and I saw a hole in my stomach and then I looked up to a mirror and there was a massive gaping hole down my whole body and I was holding all my organs in place from falling out while screaming and crying in pain.  Didn’t even realize it wasn’t real until I woke up screaming from it.  Physically felt real too.  Can anyone tell me why I’d have a dream like this?
My	did.	My T told me: What happened to you doesn't make you unlovable. Besides crying uncontrollably when I say this to myself, I find it helpful as a way to remind myself that I am someone worthy of being cared about.  For me, this is not only helpful for my normal relationships, but also has been helpful in trying to combat my negative thoughts that my T doesn't care about me, is annoyed with me, and that I will never be able to repair our relationship. So that's it.  I just wanted to be able to give that same message to someone else who might need it in the way I did. 
I also don’t want to talk about the events	it results in nightmares for weeks if I do	Earlier in my life I had quite a few unfortunate incidents that led to my PTSD.  I’m on medication and seeing a therapist, but I just don’t know how to open up.  I know they can’t help if I don’t talk, and I’ve only given them very small pieces of information.  I guess I’m ashamed or embarrassed.   <e1> I also don’t want to talk about the events </e1>  because  <e2> it results in nightmares for weeks if I do </e2>  .  At the same time, I don’t want to keep living like this. . How did you finally manage to open up about your trauma and the events?
Has	up?	Has anyone tried to quit smoking nicotine and notice an increase in their Symptoms? My SO (combat vet if that matters) has recently taken to quit smoking.  I know his nightmares and insomnia are ramped up, so I can only imagine his flashbacks are as well.  He’s been keeping very to himself and I know he’ll talk about it when he’s ready but I’m curious if anyone has gone through a similar thing and if there was anything that helped or with time did it ease up?
So,	way.	So, I was seeking therapy thinking I had inattentive ADHD, but I didn’t want to diagnose myself.  Turns out I have PTSD from childhood abuse and I never once thought that my symptoms were related to it.  I’m very forgetful, anxious, I lack motivation and concentration, I dissociate, and a bunch of other things. I can’t remember part of my childhood and my therapist told me that my brain is so busy protecting me from hurtful memories that I can’t seem to relax and enjoy the present.  I always wake up with bad anxiety, and when I want to watch a show or play something, I feel extremely guilty, like I don’t deserve it. When I was younger, I started getting grounded at the age of 3.  Being locked in a bathroom with the lights off, having to face a wall, forced to go to sleep, insulted many times, etc.  This led me to have low self esteem and retained anger for many, many years.  I guess knowing the reason why I’m like this, relieves me. I’m 19, by the way. 
Hello	welcomed.	Hello all, I am 26 years old and I work as a paramedic in Louisville, Ky.  I’ve been doing EMS for about 6 years.  The past year had been really hard on me.  My therapist diagnosed me with PTSD.  As you can imagine, I see the worst in the world.  Specifically the last two months have been nothing but sadness and destruction.  I don’t sleep and when I do, I wake up covered on sweat and in a panic.  I never relax.  I get panic attacks at random points throughout the day.  My family thinks I’m an asshole and I’m mean.  My emotions are a roller coaster and then sometimes I just don’t have any emotions.  When things start to get better it all comes crashing down with a catastrophic run or event in my life. I do see a therapist once a week and we started doing EMDR.  I just feel so broken and exhausted.  I feel like I’m drowning and I’m not sure how much longer I can continue to feel this way.  I come on here asking for advice.  Ways to cope.  Any advice is welcomed. 
Might	me.	Might as well offer some support right? If you're like me and think you have ptsd but can't contact your therapist or are looking for one or if you have been diagnosed already with ptsd I would suggest keeping a journal.  It's honestly been helping me as a wait for an appointment and try to push myself to make one (I'm honestly a little afraid to make appointment ?) I can organize my thoughts a lot better and keep myself from overthinking to death as well as explain how I feel during certain things like when I wake up feeling crappy or when I suddenly feel a sense of panic. Not to mention keeping a journal can help if you're also like me and can't really talk about certain traumas.  For me my throat feels like it's closing up if I try to explain what happened with words so writing down is pretty much my best option for me. 
Today	can't.	Today I woke up feeling somewhat empty.  You know those days where you just wake up feeling like you're empty and floating? It's like you just phase through the day and everything is a blur.  One moment you're in bed, the next you're on the bus heading to class, then next thing you know you're back at home just sitting in your room tired.  So emotionally tired.  That's today. I just don't feel like me.  I don't like this.  I want to cry but afraid too honestly, I just keep thinking over and over again how I have to fix this.  I made myself promise to myself that I will try to call my therapist tomorrow to scheduled an appointment.  I can't keep running from this, I just can't. 
Hello.	emotions???	Hello.  I’m doing Prolonged Exposure Therapy for a trauma that occurred many years ago.   In those years, I’ve spent many many hours convincing myself to push my feelings about the situation down.  Now, I have to let myself feel them.  I’ve done a few intense sessions and haven’t even shed a tear.  I want to feel.  I want to let it go.  I’m worried that I’ve ruined those chances by convincing myself that I was okay and to push everything down.  Does anyone relate?  How do you open yourself up to those emotions???
I	.	I missed taking my ziprasidone and duloxetine 3 days ago.  Didn’t double dose, just took my meds the next morning.  Since then, it seems both meds have absolutely stopped working.  I’m severely depressed, suicidal and have been considering going inpatient.  I can’t handle daily life anymore. Within these last 3 days, my son was diagnosed with autism.  That’s been weighing on my mind heavily.  I’m also in college and finals are all this week.  This is my first ever successful try with school after 4 years of on-off enrollment.  Between the two, I am the financial supporter of my family so payday (yesterday) drained me even more. My question is this, am I having an episode or am I burned out or what? I’ve been crying more and my positive symptoms are starting to flare up, specifically those voices. . 
I've	lost.	I've lived in apartments for quite some time and never had to any issues.  Probably about 6 or so months ago we got downstairs neighbors and the guy that was down there heavily abused his kids and wife.  I called CPS and so on and they ended up getting kicked out so I'm not sure what actually happened to the poor kids and wife.  Anyways this triggered me, I grew up with a very abusive father and with all that going on beneath us and with it being loud enough to hear all the way upstairs I can't shake it.  It's been months and every sound that I hear from the new people makes me go into full on panic when they aren't even that bad.  I know I have PTSD from my childhood but I don't know any coping mechanisms to help me not completely freak out from random door slams, windows being shut etc.  It's gotten so bad that even I trigger myself.  I feel very lost. 
I'll feel overwhelmed	my brain can't even process what either person is saying	This isn't as much of an issue for me compared to my brain fog and short term memory issues but I didn't realize until yesterday that my ability to concentrate when there are other noises has also gone downhill.  I used to be able to somewhat get by, but post-trauma I can't accomplish anything unless it's quiet or some kind of ambient music. . .  Or when I'm on the phone with someone and someone in the same room as me is talking, it used to just annoy me but now   <e1> I'll feel overwhelmed </e1>  because  <e2> my brain can't even process what either person is saying </e2>  so it just feels like dissonant noise. 
I	me	I am going thru a rough patch of paranoia right now and could use some friendly support to help me get through it.  My family is of no help at all they are embarrassed of my condition.  I have schizo affective and cptsd and cannot trust anyone close to me I need some people that can understand me
I	love	I was majorly triggered by a call with mum last night and was in a terrible state.  It was so hard to do even the basics of sending myself to bed and feeding myself.  I had no motivation to care for myself. I awoke this morning feeling pretty rubbish but I channelled the stress and adrenaline into much needed cleaning that I hadn't done in a long time. I feel mentally clearer now that my space is clear.  I feel sore, anxious and stressed still but at least the view is something I can feel proud of and enjoy. It really takes a lot out of you, PTSD.  I applaud all of you who are here, taking one day at a time, one minute even, at times.  We have to endure some of the hardest, most painful and distressing emotions, often completely by ourselves with little to no support.  It is really, really hard.  Please be kind to yourself.  It is something we have to practise a lot, but necessary to our survival Sending all my love to those that are feeling distressed, average, okay and a bit better today.  We all need LOTS of love 
To	that.	To start, I don’t know if any of this is  due to ptsd.  After years of trying so many psych meds, it’s hard to know what I’m actually dealing with. I had some fairly traumatic events happen three years ahi, like getting kicked out of my parents house, sleeping in the cold under a tree, and being put in a psych ward in bad conditions with horrible staff. Anyway, I used to cry all the time.  I wailed when I lost my pets, it was totally natural. But I haven’t cried once since getting kicked out three years ago.  I feel no sense of motivation or excitement and I can’t feel love or affection towards anyone. I’ve taken mood stabilizers which do nothing for me.  The only thing I feel is either severe depression or the euphoria of drugs.  There is no normal functional contentment. I’ve never really considered the possibility of ptsd but I’m starting to think my symptoms may be common with that. 
TW:	understands.	TW: Assault, description of triggers (I tried not to go into detail but it's still kinda specific) * * * * * * * * I'm not really sure if I belong here, I don't actually have a PTSD diagnosis, I guess I'm too anxious to ask my doctor how to go about it, but I'm not sure where else to go.  It's just as the title says really, I'm having a bit of a rough night.  I was attacked by a roomate late last year, and I distinctly remember him leaning over me, leaning on my doorway and refusing to move.  I read about someone leaning on a doorway and blocking the door, in a totally different context, but it was enough to make me feel so anxious.  I'm doing all my coping mechanisms, I'm listening to the anxiety playlist I made myself, I've been reading a story that normally makes me feel calm and content, I did a workout today (pre-trigger) and that always helps to steady my mood.  I'm just frustrated with myself and the situation, and hoping someone out there understands. 
I can't remember a time before I was sexually abused	I grew up with it	  <e1> I can't remember a time before I was sexually abused </e1>  because  <e2> I grew up with it </e2> .  I'm an adult now and I still have a lot to work through but overall I have my life under control and I'm happy most of the time. My issue is that I'm stuck with the thought that if I could make one wish it would be to be small enough to really lay in someone's arms, you know? I know it sounds disturbing but I really wish I was small enough for my boyfriend to hold me like you hold a newborn.  It's not a sexual thing, I just imagine a very pure feeling of safety. I think about it all the time and I feel a lot of shame about it.  Does anyone else recognize themself in this somehow? Any ideas of how I can stop?
Trigger	guys.	Trigger warning direct topic of original traumaHey guys.  Trigger warning talk about sex Trigger warning rape trigger warning suicidal ideation trigger warning ventingI was about 5 when I started feeling sexual.  I'm a female and 26 nowI just wanted to learn and explore sexually.  But I don't think I was really allowed. I'm not sure if I was properly bathed when I was younger. Both my parents were abused when they were kids. SucksTo this day in not comfortable with the thought of having sex. I've already had it a lot with about 9 different guys. 
I’ve	better.	I’ve been trying to find out if this phenomenon has a clinical term, so I thought I’d see if the community has any information to offer. I’ve experienced this for pretty much as long as I can remember. Sometimes when I experience a trigger (yelling, being chased, etc. ) or just feel threatened in general, I will completely lose the ability to speak.  And anytime I try to push myself to talk, it feels like it goes against the entire nature of my being.  As if speaking will put me in a terrible situation. It feels very similar to a freeze response, however, there’s been plenty of times where I’ve been unable to talk, yet I’ll be free from any dissociation or fogginess.  And similarly, there’s also been times where I’ve been heavily dissociating and not able to talk. I’ve been trying my best to combat this feeling or even learn to cope with it bye using written or visual language as opposed to vocal language.  But I still feel like it would help so much more to understand exactly what it is in order to handle it better. 
C-PTSD	the events leading up to losing him 22 months ago	I have no ability to recall happy memories of many events, especially those that pertain to my son.  My  <e1> C-PTSD </e1>  was caused by  <e2> the events leading up to losing him 22 months ago </e2>  .  He was 26 years old.  I found him as he was actively dying, and that imagery swamped my mind for many, many months.  I used a lot of distractions to try to find relief; went to therapy until last summer; and had planned to try EMDR, except C19 prevented that.  I look at photos that I took all throughout my son's life, and I can't remember most of the occasions.  I feel like this makes no sense.  Why can't my mind forget the horrible moments and let me have some good thoughts?
I've never had any before	the thought always worried me	  <e1> I've never had any before </e1>  because  <e2> the thought always worried me </e2>  but I'm getting to a point where I'm seriously reconsidering that
I	'episode'?Thanks.	I find it very difficult to describe what I'm experiencing to people when I have attacks.  I don't have the language to describe the experience. There's panic attacks, which I've had before, and then there's. . .  this.  It's not just panic.  It's like a complete breakdown, I feel like I'm dying and I'm deathly afraid.  I'm rolling on the ground screaming and howling like a tortured animal, and I'm crying and screaming so hard I start to choke.  I can't think straight, I can't see straight, my ears are ringing, and I can't breathe.  I loop, screaming the same three words over and over.  I don't know word to use when I tell my doctor about it other than like a panic attack, but really bad.  Is there a term for this? A particular type of panic or other attacks? An 'episode'?Thanks. 
PTSD	struggle.	PTSD is more like an injury than a disease I think.  And C-PTSD is like when a child breaks a bone and doesnt receive help, so that the bone heals poorly, causing more lasting pain. If I got in an accident and broken my bones you wouldn't call me sick, talk to me like a child, tell me I'm diseased, pathological defective, or criticize my character and worldview.  You wouldn't tell me I didn't break my bones, becasue only veterans can have broken bones.  You wouldn't tell me to suck it up and walk it off.  You wouldn't dismiss my thoughts and feelings as just the product of pain.  You wouldn't ask me to carry a heavy box if I had a broken leg, and you wouldn't look down on me for saying I can't do that until it heals. So why do so many people, even professionals, do this with PTSD? It's really fucking me up and devastating my self-esteem.  I feel broken, different, and inferior.  I struggle everyday not to feel bad thinking about the awful ways that people, ewcpailly healthcare peofessionals, have characterized my struggle. 
Everyone	exactly?	Everyone in my life seems to think my triggers are addiction/drug related but they aren’t at all.  I am really triggered by dead looking things, discolored skin, cold skin etc.  it comes up a lot and i dont know how to explain it exactly?
I	this???	I actually have complex PTSD, but I’m wondering if anyone else here does this? I self destruct almost compulsively and I don’t know how to stop.  I have small periods where I feel like I’ve got a handle on myself and feel motivated to do better and take care of myself, but the second I start feeling helpless, I invite abuse right back in.  I invite it back in with open arms.  When I have no one in my life to abuse me, I reach out to previous abusers.  When I can’t do that, I actively self harm through cutting or hurting myself or smoking, drinking or starving. I hate myself for it, and I don’t understand why I do this.  I don’t understand what’s wrong with me.  Am I alone in this???
it's hard	I want so much to feel that physical closeness with others but my mind and body won't let me	Physical touch makes me feel anxious and trapped.  I can't cuddle with my partner for more than a few minutes without starting to feel like I need to try and get away. I can recognize that this is probably from my PTSD, but  <e1> it's hard </e1>  because  <e2> I want so much to feel that physical closeness with others but my mind and body won't let me </e2> . 
Hi,	remain.	Hi, losing memory is becoming worse to me.  I am unable to recall lots of memories and having difficulty going to the past, I can't go to get anymore.  Used to be proud of my past, now it's hard to even access it without crying, I am scared that I am about to lose my identity, how I am.  Please I need help, I don't want to lose my memories, good memories feel like they fade away, and now bad hurtful memories remain. 
I'm 25 with no kids	they will not tie my tubes	I stopped my birth control a few months ago, me and my partner broke up and I had to move back in with my parents. But my period has now came back but it is being very irregular. In the past month I have had 3, and I also have a yeast infection. I always get triggered by things feeling different down in that area, but this is so bad that I started hitting and biting me.  I hate this. Also,  because  <e1> I'm 25 with no kids </e1>  ,  <e2> they will not tie my tubes </e2>  . But it's so fucking triggering and I can't handle it. I have been up since 5 AM and I feel very overwhelmed. It feels like I am going to get so desperate I am going to take this into my own hands. FUCK
I	one?	I am recently diagnosed and experiencing extremes.   Highs and lows.   Lack of sleep.   Flashbacks.  I'm exhausted and my emotional teaspoons are not refilling.   I'm so empty of emotion that I feel every. single. drop of serotonin.   My cat was playing and I felt my brain light up for just a moment and disappear and I almost cried.   I just wanted a moment more to indulge in that feeling. . . Am I the only one?
last	:/	last year i started dating my best friend.  i had just had a really bad year with my ptsd getting the better of me.  i was finally in a good space, only having flashbacks maybe twice a week.  i thought that getting into a relationship again would be okay since i was happy at the time.  as time has gone on, i’ve started to spiral again and have gone back to how i was feeling last year.  he says he doesn’t mind my episodes but i feel so guilty for making it a part of his life.  he doesn’t know the extent of my trauma and i wish i could open up to him in order for him to get a better understanding of the way i am but it’s so difficult :/
Recently	head.	Recently my therapist told me I have PTSD (which wasn't a diagnosis I expected) and at first I was kind of sad, but the more I research it the better I feel.  It's like I finally have an explanation for all the  behaviors I used to constantly beat myself up over.  I'm genuinely looking forward to doing more work to identify my triggers and learn to manage them.  I even feel kinda compelled to tell the friends and family I'm close to so that they can better understand me.  The only thing I'm sad about now is that I went so long without knowing what was going on with my head. 
One	this?	One of my triggers is the song that was playing when I regained consciousness during the event that caused my ptsd.  I get very anxious when listening to music in the same genre if I haven't made the playlist.  I tend to avoid listening to the radio and such.  Hearing it triggers major flashbacks for me.  I play in a softball league that plays music on big speakers very loudly.  The whole time I feel like I'm on the verge af a panic attack worried this song is going to play.   The guy that runs the league is a really nice guy and I think that if I could explain in the right way he would agreed to not play it.  I just don't want to get into any details but I feel like he would need to understand that it is more than I just don't like this song.  I would rather email him than talk in person.   Does anyone have a suggestion on how to go about wording this?
I got screamed at by zoo customers	I didn’t hear them	I don’t really have emotional support irl. .  even if no one else sees this, I just need to say it. I have so many problems that I know I’m causing and can’t figure out how to fix.  Feeling really alone and sad most of the time.  Today has been a real mess too.  I had a fight with my bf this morning.  While I was volunteering at the zoo,  <e1> I got screamed at by zoo customers </e1>  because  <e2> I didn’t hear them </e2> .  I’ve been in and out of flashbacks all day. It feels like I keep losing more and more of a grip on my symptoms recently.  The flashbacks are much more frequent and harder to get through.  My inner critic has gotten stronger since I’ve tried shrinking it? Therapy caused me financial strain and more problems mentally. The only thing I can think of is starting to care for my basic needs better.  I just graduated college and I’m trying to find a job but I feel like I’m no condition to work. Typing this out helped me feel less alone.  Thank you. 
She	see.	She wrote “patient struggles with depression and CPTSD. ”   She was deciding which med to use to treat my newly-diagnosed psoriatic arthritis, and elected not to use one that might alter my mood.  Seeing it in writing from another doctor made me feel like “yeah, it’s real, not just in my imagination. ”  Kinda good, kinda sad to see it in writing.  I hate when you think you’ve hidden it so well and suddenly it’s out there for someone else to see. 
In	bad.	In the mornings I usually feel fine and even if I dont I can cope with whatever feeling Im dealing with but at night time I feel like absolute shit and I cant control anything and I think I have this type of insomnia that I wake up at the same time everyday like 3 in the morning and I cant go back to sleep at least for 1 hour and during that time I just feel so bad and hopeless about everything, I get paranoid and scared and I just genuinly have a hard time.  I hear how everyone gets so productive at night time and how theyre night birds and for me its the opposite.  Im not productive anytime but at least in the mornings I feel fine.  Its one of those times I woke up in the middle of the night and I know I wont be able to go back to sleep and I saw a nightmare.  And I feel so bad. 
I	love!	I just really want to say thank you to this community.  I posted something that I've been struggling with yesterday and it's a tough decision to make but I just want to thank everyone for not just saying just leave but listening and understanding the motives behind my decisions or understanding that they don't have the full picture.  This is the first time I haven't felt judged by my condition in a very long time. So thank you.  Give yourselves a hug and keep spreading this calm love!
I’m so open and honest about my shit	I never want it used against me	Anyone else ever get accused of being bipolar? I just can’t understand why people have such a hard time accepting ptsd as a psychological injury.  It’s not a mental illness.  It’s legit brain damage.   <e1> I’m so open and honest about my shit </e1>  because   <e2> I never want it used against me </e2> .  If I were bipolar, I would be in a crusade for that. I in no way “act” bipolar either.  But every time I commit to my boundaries or express myself and feelings lately, it seems I’m digging a hole with the most important person in my life.  He’s without compassion for my struggles and seems to be adding to them. 
You might cry or scream	it hurts	When you've lived through difficult experiences and carry trauma, it's like you're walking through life soaked in gasoline.  Sometimes you'll come  across people who don't understand how much that trauma effects you; they strike a match and hold it to their own skin.  Maybe a little sting, but it's not too bad. And then they hold the match to your skin, gasoline and all, and you go up in  flames.    <e1> You might cry or scream </e1>  , because  <e2> it hurts </e2> , of course it hurts.  Confused, maybe even offended, they say, Woah, calm down! Why are you burning?Some people don't understand the nature of trauma and triggers.  They haven't lived it, and they don't know what that fire feels like.  That isn't a you problem.  You haven't done anything wrong by simply having been hurt. I hope this post offers some clarity and comfort; you aren't alone. 
They both said they sent them	I own a home	Hi everyone, this is my first post. I have been in therapy using IFS and EMDR for 3 years to work on myself after being raised in an unstable and abusive household.  I’ve worked incredibly hard and I have improved a lot, but certain things still trigger me. I received photos of myself, from childhood (infant-10 years) in the mail from my mother and grandmother for my last birthday a few weeks ago.    <e1> They both said they sent them </e1>  because  <e2> I own a home </e2> , but do not have any photos of myself on display.  I realized, looking at the photos they sent me, that I can only see the pain and hurt that the child in the photos was going through and it upsets me to look at them. Does anyone else identify with this?
It’s	anymore	It’s like every time she walks into the room she sucks all the air out of it and I’ve lost any ounce of energy I had.  Nothing is ever okay there’s always something wrong and I can’t deal with her constant criticism anymore.  I love her but it feels like my self-esteem is being crushed every single time we speak to each other and I can feel myself sinking lower and lower.  As guilty as I feel for distancing myself from her I just can’t do this anymore
it frustrates me	it feels like I’m back at square one starting completely over with all the progress I’d made	I normally feel like I’m doing pretty okay.  I hardly think about my trauma anymore and when I do, I don’t feel overwhelmed by it.  Last night, something that seems very small triggered an anxiety attack, and I cried in my car in a parking lot for two hours.  I woke up feeling awful.  I have to work today and I have class later but I feel like hiding from everything.  I want to shut off all means of communication and hide in my room and not let anybody get close.  I don’t feel strong enough to shoulder the responsibilities that I normally handle okay, and  <e1> it frustrates me </e1>  because  <e2> it feels like I’m back at square one starting completely over with all the progress I’d made </e2> .  I know that’s probably irrational and not necessarily true.  It just feels like all the progress I’d made over the years has been ruined.  And I feel much too tired and sad and overwhelmed to do anything about it right now. 
I'm so hard on myself	not being able to do the things I love	Genuine question.  when I feel sad I feel so exhausted doing anything is hard, even playing video games is an effort.  If anyone has an answer I'd love to know.   <e1> I'm so hard on myself </e1>  for  <e2> not being able to do the things I love </e2>   (like art) when I'm down.  Maybe knowing some kind of physiological process behind it will help me not be so hard on myself. 
I've	confused	I've got everything I need to make it big, but CPTSD always brings me down.  I've always been told i got potential & I'm just lazy, and if only you could stop being lazy you'd have done this and that. As soon as I'm on drugs I become in my zone, creative and synchnorized with the real me, as soon as the effects wear off i'm back to my laziness/anxiety/Depression etcLet's take Eminem for example, no doubt the man was/is affected by his childhood trauma, yet he managed to make it big.  Does this mean I have no excuse? I'm really confused
I’m	lol	I’m actually not affected by negative external feedback when it’s happening in the present moment.  In my down time, I imagine a scenario in which someone bluntly dislikes me or recall a past event when someone wasn’t nice and I feel ashamed.  I must have done something wrong and I must be the cringey type of person who was dumb enough to think what I did was okay.  We all have an image of someone we don’t like and wonder if someone disliking us means we become that.  The anticipation of pain from someone disliking me is enough to make me nervous before people. I flip flop from image to image and spend lots of time reasoning out why how I did actually doesn’t mean I’m the image I associate with disapproval. Help lol
I	back.	I documented my CPTSD journey on this subreddit under the name u/MasterAqua2. . . sadly, I lost all my credentials and it was on a now defunct email.  Hi guys. . . I feel a little lost without this community, and I’m glad that I’m back. 
And	whaaaaa???	And Lithium and Xanax, but somehow the cocktail I got started on with my new psychiatrist seems to have fit immediately. This is my first time trying medication more than just Lithium (even that was just this January, and I dropped it after perhaps two days) and I'm wondering - is this nondepressed me or is this drugged me?Actually picking up some of my depression mess, not having to eat/sleep myself into a lump, doing and hanging laundry, having emotional reactions that  seem rational and fitting. .  like, is this what I've been missing out on this whole while????Even my attachment style and the emotions that drive it seem way more secure, and I feel distanced from the disorganized/avoidant chaos of being previously.  I get excited about things.  Like, I can do life.  Like, whaaaaa???
I’m	hugs.	I’m sick and tired of being the negative friend.  The friend who always has problems.  The friend who is always in need of support.  The friend who always has something going on.  The friend who has mental health issues. I’m so afraid that even if I heal with time, people will still see me as the one who has issues.  This makes me want to hide and never talk about what I’m going through again.  I can feel that people are getting tired of me and it hurts so much. LE: I wanted to once again express my gratitude towards this community.  We’ve got it, peeps.  I thank that we’re incredibly resilient and that we can heal.  I truly believe that this is possible.  Please don’t give up.  Sending hugs. 
Don’t	once.	Don’t misunderstand I’m glad they have gotten so far and I tell them as much.  They’ve worked extremely hard to accomplish what they have and deserve to reap the benefits but a part of me is still deeply saddened that I may never get to experience that.  I can’t entertain the idea of furthering my education without having painful emotional flashbacks and on top of that I’m guilt-ridden so I feel even worse.  I want to be able to study something I’m passionate about without feeling petrified or like I actively want to die.  I would never take any of this out on my friends none of that is their fault or their responsibility.  I’d just like to feel normal for once. 
I have mental health training	my first thought was dissociation	I have been driving for 8 or 9 years now with no problems.  However, I think I began to disassociate for the first time today while driving on the highway.  Not sure if I'm ranting, venting, or looking for advice.  I guess all three.  Anyways, today I was driving on the highway and I started to feel detached from myself.  Like an uncontrollable wave coming over me.  It was really scary honestly.    <e1> I have mental health training </e1>  so  <e2> my first thought was dissociation </e2>  .  I started trying to ground myself using my senses.  Only pain could somewhat get through but I still couldn't feel it.  Also, looking in the mirror at myself helped.  I was able to call my partner to try to distract me until I could park somewhere safely.  I guess I'm wondering if that was dissociation and if anyone can relate? I'm still a bit shaken up about it. 
I'd	remembered!	I'd love to know why that is so that I don't keep thinking my fiance (or anyone else really) is mad at me for no reason and end up asking him I'm sorry I asked or some apology. . .  I'll bring this up to my therapist next time now that I remembered!
While	Thanks!	While I wait for an opening with this new therapist, I've decide to prepare as much as I can fx.  write down/print a lot of lists/quizes and other stuff I find online that I relate to like lists of behavior/symptoms/types of abuse/effect from abuse etc. . . Can you recommend stuff for me to google and check out? whatever it is (podcast/books/websites/articles/online tests/Youtube/types of therapy for trauma/lists etc. . . ) ??It doesn't necessarily have to be academic/theory based only, I'm open to everything :)Wouls be so helpful! Thanks!
Not	moment.	Not gonna lie, it really fucking hurts.  I made myself vulnerable, took a shot, and struck out hard.  Big swing and a miss. I've been keeping a brave face (easier to do with masks), telling myself that what I did was bold and tough and worth the risk.  I've also still been maintaining my self-care as best I can, but I'm just so drained of emotional energy I want to crawl into a hole and stay there for a week.  My body won't let me cry.  I need to think about something else, but the mindless distractions only work for so long and anything more is too much right now. I know this will subside soon enough and I'll probably be better for it in the long run, but I'm feeling really low in this moment. 
I've	sign.	I've been on a Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul kick recently and was watching an episode tonight before bed.  I'm on season 4 episode 10 watching the scene between Walt and his son.  The exchange felt just like the exchanges I'd have with my dad when he was drunk and I was a teenager.  Some of the things Walt said were almost verbatim something my dad would say to me. I felt this scene triggering my PTSD and I started having flashbacks.  Rather than keep watching I took care of myself and turned off the show.  Rather than grab the vodka that's sitting in the freezer I let myself feel the emotions as they came.  I called my dog out to sit with me and I let myself cry for the first time in months.  I let myself cry multiple times.  I sat with my dog and my emotions for a few minutes after my tears subsided.  I picked up my journal and wrote about the experience and how I felt. This isn't something I would've done a few weeks ago.  I am proud of it and wanted to share.  It's just a good sign. 
Idk	relate	Idk I just feel so lonely and always low key panicked and I just want to have my mother pick me up and take me home except I live at home with my mother and it’s really not great but I just want my mother I feel like this makes no sense but maybe one of u can relate
I’ve tried and am desperate to get better	my CPTSD has robbed me of my life	Attempting dTMS as I’ve tried multiple modalities.   I actually don’t have severe depression or OCD, which the disorder dTMS is generally recommended for, but I am at the edge of all the different therapies  <e1> I’ve tried and am desperate to get better </e1>  as  <e2> my CPTSD has robbed me of my life </e2>  . What I really want out of this is for the trauma to shake out of my body.   I had an excellent experience with Neurofeedback relieving the tension on the right side of my body.   My left side is full of tension and physiologically the root of my anxiety when my fight or flight kicks in. Am posting day by day progress here
I did have a whole lot of traumatic events growing up in a very religious family in poverty	don’t think I have CPTSD	I live in a very small town in the south. I didn’t go to war or see (that many) horrid things in my life.   <e1> I did have a whole lot of traumatic events growing up in a very religious family in poverty </e1>  . So local therapists (the few there are, and who are all very religious themselves)  <e2> don’t think I have CPTSD </e2>  . I feel asking for Telehealth therapist recommendations might be against the rule, but I desperately (DESPERATELY) need a therapist who understands and can help me.   I’ll pay anything.  ANYTHINGPlease, the therapist merry go round has really taken its toll on me and I just want a recommendation for someone who understands emotional flashbacks and my “bursts. ”Does anyone have a recommendation they can Dm me?
Especially	relate?	Especially in the mornings, sometimes I wake up and feel like I am a completely helpless infant who has no one to hold on to, utterly lost and desperate. I mean, adult self is in the background and can get me out of bed and functioning to a necessary degree m, but in times like this the suffering is crippling. Can anyone relate?
their health is used to guilt you into attending their birthday	it might be their last.	What do you call it when your abuser uses their health problems to manipulate you? For example, when you are low contact they misrepresent the severity of an illness to trick you into seeing them.  Or   <e1> their health is used to guilt you into attending their birthday </e1>  because  <e2> it might be their last.  </e2> 
I’m	recommendations?	I’m in the market to buy a smartwatch that can track my sleep, stress, and can also help me with daily reminders, like medications and appointments, etc. I’ve been googling options but I’m super overwhelmed by all of the options.  Does anyone here have any recommendations?
I	desperate	I have recently started to hit the moniter of of my (not in use) PC whenever I get angry. . .  I used to hit my head on wall and slap myself when I was young, then I started keeping a thin rubber band around my wrist and snap it whenever I did something annoying or had compulsive thoughts. I also sometimes bang and through kitchen utensils and bang doors.  Thses things earn me a shouting that's why the PC moniter has become my new victim.  I know I'm gonna get crucified when my family notices what's been happening to it and they might kick me out for ruining something this expensive. I need to be stopped but I can't take all the tension on myself that's why I do these things.  I need help but don't have money or any support system.  Please give me some advice that can help me.  I'm desperate
I’m experiencing a lot of distress	memories of sexual abuse/grooming that happened to me not that long ago	So  <e1> I’m experiencing a lot of distress </e1>  lately over   <e2> memories of sexual abuse/grooming that happened to me not that long ago </e2>  and the things this man made me do are haunting me everyday and I feel constant feelings of guilt,shame and anxiety.  I had a first session with hypnotherapy and having my 2nd session next week.  Has anyone here tried treating trauma with hypnotherapy and how did they find it after a few sessions? I’m so desperate to escape these symptoms I’m having I feel so trapped and hypnotherapy seems to work really fast with people with anxiety and other mental health issues
I hate this knee-jerk reaction	I DO have empathy	I would love advice on this if anyone has thoughts.  I realized recently that when others are feeling tired, sick, or in pain, i often feel impatient and frustrated with them.  I find myself unconsciously minimizing what's wrong with them, assuming that they could push through if they wanted to, and assuming that their complaints are a manipulative ploy for my attention. When I was a kid, injury or sickness meant basically nothing and I was forced to attend school/sports feverish, vomiting, even bleeding from the mouth or struggling to walk.  My pain/exhaustion was always dismissed, and so I feel completely evil when these thoughts come up.  My partner just had their COVID vaccination, and I snapped at them and told them they should have been better prepared for the pain.    <e1> I hate this knee-jerk reaction </e1> , because  <e2> I DO have empathy </e2> !!! It just gets drowned out by this trauma response.  I can almost hear my parents' voices in my own words, and it makes me feel crazy.  Does anyone have advice for how to stay patient when your own trauma bubbles up like this?
I	situation?	I have been so frustrated with my last few therapists.  It seems we spend at least half of our sessions talking about things that are not directly related to my trauma. What I imagine good therapy would look like is the therapist has a sort of lesson plan, they take an inventory of my trauma and apply it to that, they map it all out in advance.  Maybe we'll veer off every once in a while, but they're steering the ship.  Maybe adjustments need to be made to the roadmap sometimes, but we know where we're headed.  I hate hearing that I'm supposed to lead this and that they're along for the journey.  If I could fix myself, I would have.  I don't need a life companion, I NEED to address my problems head on, one by one, there is alot to work through.  I am not all that unique.  Maybe my expectations don't match reality, but I'm thoroughly unimpressed with the process so far. Anyone had success? What does it look like for you? Any advice for me about handling this and improving  my therapy/healing situation?
After	issues.	After each session, I gain a little more insight into my past and all the different events — which is good, I think.  Yet, at the same time, I get knocked down to my knees and just feel emotionally drained.   Depleted from any will or energy and just cry-laugh.  I can slip into these depressive states where I am struggling to do anything; though it is not a constant state, more of an irregular one that comes and goes in between my sessions.  Needless to say, I do find myself 'lagging behind' on daily life and responsibilities. I have been previously in therapy and on antidepressants for other reasons.  I have just been wondering if I should talk to my GP and ask about antidepressants? I am unsure if pharmacological intervention is common when processing trauma through therapy or even common practice.  I don't want to come across to my GP the wrong way as I already have been 'bugging' them about a small bunch of other health-related issues. 
nobody ever saw us of having real problems or having need of support	our grades	As a child I was hiding the secret of a chaotic, alcoholic household, a depressed mum, responsibility of my brother and crippling social anxiety. BUT I did very well academically.  (Until A levels but that’s a different story). All the other kids with problems but bad grades were given counselling, therapy, assigned teachers to watch over them and a lot of attention and support. I was in the top set.  I had friends there who were sexually abused, dyspraxic, depressed etc, but  <e1> nobody ever saw us of having real problems or having need of support </e1>  because of  <e2> our grades </e2>  . I’m so mad at this messed up example of the school system.  Even when I had a literal breakdown at sixteen and told someone for the very first time about my crappy childhood, I was just told off for missing my maths lesson, put in the deputy heads office to make sure I organised my work better, and was let go with an air of disapproval. I feel so let down by everybody. 
You can’t be your true self	if you do you don’t get the pittance you need to sustain your bodies basic needs	Like for me, I have always been poor.  I can’t hold down a job for long and the ones I get pay hardly anything. So I end up getting help from others and the unspoken theme of receiving that help is “don’t talk about the past, pretend everything is ok. ”So the idea of Gabor matte about authenticity gets thrown out the window.    <e1> You can’t be your true self </e1>  because  <e2> if you do you don’t get the pittance you need to sustain your bodies basic needs </e2> . 
written or practicing what I want to say again	fear of humiliation	I just realized I do this a lot.  Deactivating and then reactivating my social media accounts.  I know that social media can be unhealthy and detoxing is one of the reasons I leave and go back.  But I’ve noticed I often feel paranoid when using socials.  I feel that I will end up being humiliated for something.  I think it’s partially linked to perfectionism and low self worth. . .  like I’m not worthy enough or perfect enough to take up space and express myself on social media. The same goes for emails, phone calls, texts.  When I’m on the receiving end and I get something unexpectedly I get very nervous.  And when sending I can spend huge chunks of time rereading and checking what I’ve  <e1> written or practicing what I want to say again </e1>  due to  <e2> fear of humiliation </e2>  . Edit: Feels good to know so many can relate to these feelings.  This is so heartwarming?? and thank you for the awards!
During	past?	During recent EMDR I realised my angelic, calm and unconditionally loving cat from childhood was the only secure adult in my household.  I always wondered why my sisters became narcissists while I held on to my empathy, and I do genuinely think having her in my life kept me going.  She was a healer.  My mother had her put down without telling us and I am only now able to grieve her death. Do you guys have a pet that keeps you going through your recovery, or that helped you in the past?
It	us.	It would be nice if things were offset in a way so that, somehow, finding peace would be easier after a life of torment.  Or, at the very least, if things could be more neutral. . .  instead it is like we are being punished with CPTSD for all that we’ve been through. I’m sitting here paralyzed with no energy after a day at work, mostly spent crying and mourning, even after many years of therapy.  I don’t know how to put a positive spin on this anymore.  I feel like I’m already dead and have been for years. Edit: You are lovely people.  Thanks for the support and for letting me know that I’m not alone.  It’s hard to reply to all of you, but just know I’ve read every comment and I wish all of you well.  Hopefully one day it will finally get easier for us. 
I	?	I met my friend after a therapy appointment and was explaining what EMDR is and she told me that I'm no more screwed up than anyone else and that if I would just stop thinking about it and reading about it I would get better.  She also told me to work out and eat more veggies. I'm reeling.  While she was talking I made a mental note to never tell her anything important ever again.  Surface only.  Or just stop the friendship. Why do people have SO MUCH trouble with empathy? Why can't people just sit there and say Wow, that must be hard. Edit: I just want to say thank you to all of you for your insights! Each comment is very appreciated.  Everyone's input is very valuable to me and I'm so happy we have this community to give us advice and tell us hard things ?
Both	etc.	Both my parents are messed up in very differnt ways.  We are low contact right now, so that makes things easier, but I'm still scared about it.  I just have to send a Facebook message then unfriend/block.  Such a little thing to do but it's taken YEARS to build up the self love and courage to do. Cheers to an abuse free 2021 full of love and healing!Edit: Thank you so much for the support, awards, and gold! I feel so supported and love this community so much! Edit 2: If you’re looking for a sign to do this too, this is it.  Also lock down your passwords, personal info, safety, etc. 
I	same?	I just want to lie in bed, in a cute cabin in a forrest with a beautiful lake view, watching funny videos, not having to talk to any humans or do any adulting.  I just want to exist and feel a nice breeze and smell of the forrest, surrounded by couple of friendly deers, occasionally go and play board games with my far away neighbours.  Is this so much to ask? Does anyone else feel the same?
No one can know that they want to die	no one knows what dying is like	He criticized me for taking medication, as he often does, and I told him that without it, I'm suicidal all the time.  His response was   <e1> No one can know that they want to die </e1>  , because  <e2> no one knows what dying is like </e2>  . What an invalidating load of pseudo-philosophical bullshit, IMO.  When I was being vulnerable and opening up about something serious. And he seems to think that his statement should just cure me of suicidal tendencies. How would you react to being told this?
I	shameful.	I can never quite understand how parents simply allow their children to speak in silly voices, say ridiculous things, or do funny stuff; like, that was so monumentally-not-allowed in my childhood that I still have problems expressing myself at 27.  I still expect the soul-crushing glare of contempt from every witness any time I do/say anything rooted in my own self-expression - and more often than not, I stop myself long before I get to that point. Why doesn't the typical parent crack down and micromanage everything their child does? Why isn't the child's every word and action monitored, questioned and corrected? Why are they not excessively-shamed for every silly thing they say or do? It makes no sense to me. My self-expression being something of shame is so matter-of-fact to me that I genuinely can't see why it wouldn't be shameful. 
I will not be watching it	I’m not in the mood for a one way ticket to trigger town	A bunch of my friends are posting about this Netflix documentary The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez.   <e1> I will not be watching it </e1>  because  <e2> I’m not in the mood for a one way ticket to trigger town </e2>  . But I’m bothered by how shocked everyone is. I think I’m just angry or jealous about their ability to be in their 30s and 40s and so blissfully unaware of the existence of these issues. Idk, every time a big child abuse case is in the news and being talked about, this bothers me.  It makes me feel very angry. Does anyone else have similar feelings about this right now?
I'm	etc.	I'm no eugenicist by ANY means and I understand that this concept is blurring the line of morality, but I do think there is a legitimate discussion to be had concerning if it is ethical to allow certain people to be guardians; unstable, selfish, violent, financially unprepared, etc. 
The	classmate.	The convoluted ways in which almost everything I do goes completely wrong never cease to amaze me.  From simply buying a game (which, despite the disc being perfectly okay, doesn't work) to the pursuit of my dream job leading me into the most nightmarishly-toxic workplace imaginable. It's as though the decades of intense daily abuse simply weren't enough punishment for my existence.  No, in addition to drowning in CPTSD, everything I do has to go not just wrong, but turn into a total disaster.  Literally worst-case scenario, every single time.  Why? Why does it have to be this way?And above all: There's always some damn abuser nearby, no matter what.  It's almost like there's a massive global conspiracy of abusers who are assigned to make my life as miserable as possible wherever I go; whether it's a family member, a neighbour, a coworker, or a classmate. 
I'm spending the day doing fun stuff	I want to physically show myself that life can be beautiful, and carefree	I'm kind of down this morning so I felt like writing this.  My mind keeps trying to find stuff to worry about but I know that it's just the affect that the trauma had on my brain.  The venting, arguments, crying, emotional incest, and the parentification turned me into who I am now.  Crying over my mom being depressed, my dad cheating, or the mortgage not being paid.  All problems that should not have concerned me.  <e1> I'm spending the day doing fun stuff </e1>  because  <e2> I want to physically show myself that life can be beautiful, and carefree </e2>  .  Healing my inner child.  There is no need to anxiously fixate on things.  I'll just go to my favorite place, and bring some stuff that I enjoy doing.  I'll exercise & enjoy nature.  I've made lots of progress over the years, and even though I feel like giving up at times, I'll keep moving forward.  I'm going to have a good day today, and I hope you all do too. 
My	life.	My girlfriend said this to me tonight after I thanked her for putting up with my quirks.  It hit my right in the gut, and I started sobbing immediately. I grew up in a home where the “joke” was that we didn’t love each other, we “tolerated” each other.  I am shaken up that someone could find joy in what has annoyed everyone around me my whole life. 
I wasn’t like all of the other kids my age	I had to leave school early to see a psychologist	I just need to not feel so alone on this journey.  It’s debilitating. I had majority of my traumas occur by the age of 15 and as a young girl I was quite mentally ill.  I had no idea and I remember the realisation when I it occurred to me that  <e1> I wasn’t like all of the other kids my age </e1>  because  <e2> I had to leave school early to see a psychologist </e2>  and I was suicidal at age 7 before even having a real grasp on what life really was.  As I got older I looked forward to becoming an adult as my peers’ mothers told me that it would get better and I took their word for it.  My condition just worsened and I learnt to adapt in my toxic environment to become ‘high functioning’. Did anyone else not realise as a child that these intrusive thoughts, flashbacks and feelings would not just go away?
People	Wednesday.	People around the world are terrified for their lives, stockpiling food and supplies for the worst, not sleeping, having anxiety that they're going to be got by the thing. Everyone, young, old, man or woman that they come into contact with could be dangerous and the death of them and the death will be painful, terrifying and brutal. They are hiding in their homes, afraid of the outside world.  Afraid that the government doesn't care and will let them die without treatment and leave them penniless and destitute. Me, with Complex PTSD and PTSD, it's just Wednesday. 
Hey,	you.	Hey, if you’re reading this - whether you’re lurking or commenting or posting, I just want to say thanks.  Especially to the mods. I don’t think I’ve seen a single person be purposefully rude or mean whilst I’ve been on this subreddit and it’s just the nicest place.  You can share without worry and people will almost always respond with an upvote or a kind word. I know a lot of us didn’t have people when we were younger but whatever energy you’re able to give I’m sure a lot of our younger selves would be happy we’re trying.  Thank you for helping so many people try. TLDR; thanks.  For being there.  For being kind.  For listening.  Thank you. 
TW:	normal?	TW: mentions about physical, emotional, and sexual abuseI’m pretty sure I have PTSD.  If I do then it was caused by my dads physical and mental abuse.  When ever I hear about child abuse or abuse in general I get a little shaky and I start to feel nauseous.  I sorta get similar reactions to hearing about rape but I don’t shake and instead I feel a little light headed.  I don’t remember the abuse so I don’t know if I was raped by him or another (though I don’t think he’s the type to do that sorta thing) Are these reactions to hearing about rape normal?
This past weekend I was crying	I genuinely could not remember things from that relationship	I had a very, very traumatic break up after a ten year relationship.   It caused me such deep sadness and hurt, nothing, not even the death of relatives has caused me the same sadness or pain. The break up was messy and extremely sad. I was depressed for years after it and was really suffering more than I ever thought possible. The thing is, I feel like when I try to remember some memories. . .  it is all blank.  No matter how hard I try, I cannot remember things.  It is like  black empty space.  I can remember going to a place. . .  then a blank empty space. . . .  then the end of the event.   <e1> This past weekend I was crying </e1>  because  <e2> I genuinely could not remember things from that relationship </e2> . I feel like my brain is protecting me against myself. I feel so frustrated. Does anyone else go through this?
Hello.	med?	Hello.  I’ve been recently diagnosed and I’m currently taking 37. 5 mg venflaxine er.  I am concerned about my libido.  I’m married to a wonderful woman and I don’t want to compromise or sex life.  Anyone have any issues like that with this med? 
Hey,	right.	Hey, so, i am diagnosed with ptsd, as a result of extensive trauma that lasted from early childhood into sometime in my late teens, with various things happening after as well, though those aren't really relevant here, anyway, recently my therapist noted that i have a level of what i can best describe as personality fragmentation (she didn't give me a sciency term for it), certain things trigger a shift if mannerism, attitude, various things, however, there's no lapse in memory like i understand is exhibited in DID it's also much less extreme than what i understand DID is. My main question is, does anybody know what that's called? Is it even called anything?I'll try and give the best info i can if you need more, but yeah, I'm mainly just confused at what this exactly is cuz i was curious, especially as far as explaining it to people in my life goes, and when researching it, it seemed i was using the wrong words, cuz i only got stuff for DID, which I'm pretty sure i don't have, i mean heck, idk maybe i do, but doesn't seem right. 
I went to a psych ward back in December	my mental health got terrible	So  <e1> I went to a psych ward back in December </e1>  because  <e2> my mental health got terrible </e2> .  I’m currently in therapy although I do not a have a diagnosis.  They are leaning towards c-ptsd but have also mentioned BPD and bipolar 2.  I know nightmares are common with ptsd and I was curious if any of you could tell me about your experiences with it.  My nightmares lately have been too much to put it simply.  They’re all very real feeling and don’t feel like normal nightmares not to mention I don’t dream like normal in these nightmares.  I almost always dream in 3rd person and didn’t start dreaming in 1st till these nightmares.  They give me that nasty anxious feeling in my stomach and the Adrenaline from fight or flight reflexs.  When I wake up I realize it was a dream but I’m always disoriented and have to tell myself who I am, where I’m at and what I’m doing.  It’s almost like I have to remember the last 2 years of my life to figure out what just happened. 
I	resources.	I have so many questions I want to look up, but even basic things lead straight back to veterans.  It makes me feel ashamed for having my trauma. Edit: I have no issues with veterans and them getting resources to help.  My uncle works for a VA hospital in Georgia and there I saw first saw what PTSD was like.  I thought for a long time only vets got it, then years later when I got diagnosed there were no resources for me to understand why.  It makes my trauma feel less traumatic to see that still today, 10 years later, only veterans and sometimes r*pe survivors have readily available resources. 
A	language	A few months ago I started grieving about my childhood pretty hard.  Is this normal? My PTSD diagnosis is pretty new and I don't know where else I could ask my questions. Also sorry for any spelling mistakes, english is not my first language
I don't	I want them to stay as far away from me as possible	I'm bored and I want to go meet people, but  <e1> I don't </e1>  because  <e2> I want them to stay as far away from me as possible </e2>  .  Anyone else like this? Tips?
I	cope?	I don’t want to go into detail as to why i have PTSD but i noticed instead of panic/flight/fight, i have started to dissociate/freeze which is even worse than the panic. There are literally days where i can’t remember what i did at all, my mind is empty and i didn’t accomplish anything i wanted to. I have a xanax, seroquel & propranolol prescription.  I also take adderall for ADHD (30mg total daily) and smoke half a pack a day.  None of these seem to do anything though. Would love to hear from other people here who enter a dissociated state when triggered and how do you cope?
My	future!	My Buddy is where you find a buddy who checks in on you.  No pressure, no need to form a deep friendship, just a simple message every now and then to make sure you're doing okayEdit: Ayyyyyyy Silver!! Thank you guys! I'm really happy this is growing, hopefully it'll help those who need it most and the world will grow just a bit less cold ? More good news: someone else told me they have that system irl in their country!! Who knows this organised buddy system could be a norm in the future!
I am mildly annoyed by this	The person who posted this writes a lot about their struggle with anxiety and depression but then goes ahead and trivializes ptsd	Does anyone else find it annoying when people use the word PTSD as a joke? Just a few seconds ago I saw a post in my feed about someone having PTSD from their exams.   <e1> I am mildly annoyed by this </e1> .   <e2> The person who posted this writes a lot about their struggle with anxiety and depression but then goes ahead and trivializes ptsd </e2> . 
I've	happened.	I've never known a life without trauma.  The first one happened when I was a month old.  I don't remember it but the effects still linger to this day.  Obviously, that means that I've lived my 99. 99% of my life with trauma. . .  I had other traumas happen throughout toddler hood, childhood, and into my teens.  I'm sad that I've never known what it is like to be completely carefree and without damage.  Despite being on better terms with my past, a small part of me wants to live in a life where my traumas never happened. 
The	grateful.	The meds, the therapy, it's working.  I can do more than function.  I can enjoy my life.  I'm excited for things.  I have more patience.  My episodes are shorter and easily overcome with techniques.  I didn't think I'd get better, I hoped, but didn't believe.  I'm so fucking grateful. 
I really thought I had lost my mind	got a psychiatric assessment done to check	  <e1> I really thought I had lost my mind </e1> .  So   <e2> got a psychiatric assessment done to check </e2> .  Turns out I'm OK.  We'll I'm not OK, I have CPTSD, diagnosis confirmed and long term therapy approved.  But yeah, I'm feeling somewhat relived that I've not actually gone mad like I thought I might have.  Good. 
MDMA	”	MDMA Reaches Next Step Toward Approval for Treatment - The New York Times (nytimes. com)Of the 90 people who took part in the new study, which is expected to be published later this month in Nature Medicine, those who received MDMA during therapy experienced a significantly greater reduction in the severity of their symptoms compared with those who received therapy and an inactive placebo.  Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group. MDMA produced no serious adverse side effects.  Some participants temporarily experienced mild symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite. “This is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,” said Gul Dolen, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research.  “There is nothing like this in clinical trial results for a neuropsychiatric disease. ”
Today,	this.	Today, I was formally diagnosed with PTSD.  I found out over a zoom call with my psychologist.  I haven't told anyone, not sure if I even want to tell anyone, so I'll tell reddit.  Thanks for reading. **Thank you everyone for all your kind words and encouragement.  I am overwhelmed by the amount of people reaching out.  I do appreciate all of you and your lack of judgement for me during this difficult discovery.  I plan to continue therapy and work through this. 
I	love.	I rarely talk about it with people outside of my therapist and my immediate family.  I try so hard to keep my friends and coworkers from seeing me struggle, especially when they trigger me in some way.  I have to keep all my negative feelings and emotions to myself so I don’t have to explain my disorder to people, and keep them from feeling guilty for triggering me.  It makes everything so much harder, but I don’t thing being honest with them would be productive.  The last thing I want is for this disorder to hurt the relationships with my friends and the people I love. 
there is an addiction or some sad background story to point to	then maybe they can fix it	I can't live alone. I'm too hard to live with. I can't work. I can't get disability > because < fighting for it requires mental capabilities that I don't have. Ditto for the VA. I've just been told that my episodes are too much and that I need to find somewhere else to live.  There is no where else.  I dont have a criminal record or a substance abuse issue.  Those are the only programs I can find. I don't have family to turn to.  I don't have anybody anymore. Not sure why I even bother to cry.  Stupid useless tears. Nobody cares about the mentally broken unless  <e1> there is an addiction or some sad background story to point to </e1> .  because  <e2> then maybe they can fix it </e2>  .  I can't be fixed, I guess. 
So	amazing.	So from ages 13 to 15 I was groomed by a woman and I sent her hundreds of NSFW pictures which she sold on CP sites.  Every since then I have a deathly fear of young women around the late teens early 20s age.  To the point where I dont let my 19 year old sister touch me or be in the same room as me.  But today.  Today was different, I let my sister hold my hand and I didn't freak out run away or cry I had anxiety the entire time but it wasnt a out burst like normal.  My therapist taught me to associate my sister with trust and how she would never try to hurt me and I did that I told myself in my head all she is doing is holding your hand that's it.  And it worked I'm so proud of myself I had to share it somewhere.  I know it.  Might be dumb to some but for me it was amazing. 
Just sick of waking up in this state and not knowing what to do	I don’t know the cause	This happens to me a lot and I always talk out my issues to my boyfriend whenever I start feeling like this.  But there’s a lot of times where I just wake up depressed and I don’t really know what’s wrong.  Like today for example, I had a bad dream which isn’t uncommon for me but when I first woke up I felt fine.  Then within 15-20 minutes I just became sad.  Don’t know if this is common for ptsd or maybe I’m just a bumbling idiot and I don’t know what I’m talking about.    <e1> Just sick of waking up in this state and not knowing what to do </e1>  because   <e2> I don’t know the cause </e2> 
Like	sad	Like fuck you bitch why are you smiling when I had this happen to me.  Fuck the sun for coming back up when I had this happen to me.  Why is the fucking moon shining while I am so fucking sad
Tonight	this?	Tonight my boyfriend had went upstairs and I freaked out and felt like something was wrong or something was up and I had no reason to think this and I literally packed all my stuff and was going to leave and then I just broke down crying and shaking and I ended up staying but I’ve never done that before and I was wondering if anyone else with ptsd ever experienced this?
I’ve never had a hobby	required alone time with me	I’ve spent my whole life being depressed.  At 9 I was sexually abused and since then, I’ve just been trying to distract myself from me.   <e1> I’ve never had a hobby </e1>  because that  <e2> required alone time with me </e2>  .  I got my first job at 14 and worked constantly to avoid thinking about the abuse. Most of my life, I’ve felt lost without a hobby.  Everyone has something they’re passionate about- cars, cooking, baking, knitting, what have you.  As much as I tried to get into all of those things, none of them became a constant in my life.  But! I am now spending my free time with puzzles.  I used to love jigsaw puzzles as a kid.  Now, I do jigsaw puzzles, crosswords, riddles! I’m kind of excited about this.  I’ve been so sad lately and it feels like I am taking back my life.  There actually is something out there to enjoy. 
I’ve been doing yoga	it’s supposed to be good for that mind body connection	I put my watch back on so tightly after my shower yesterday that I visibly bruised my wrist and I didn’t notice until today.  It looks like someone grabbed me roughly which ironically has happened to me before and in this location in my body too.   <e1> I’ve been doing yoga </e1>  because  <e2> it’s supposed to be good for that mind body connection </e2>  but I can’t help but think I may never be able to listen to my body again.  I’ve always felt disconnected from my physical body almost definitely as a result of my sexual trauma at a young age.  I also have a really high tolerance for physical pain.  And I would dissociate as a coping mechanism for when I was being abused.  Now it feels like this dissociative state has become a permanent fixture of my being. Have you ever felt like this? How does it manifest for you? What do you feel like when you’re not with your body?
For	loop.	For me it's the bane of my existence.  I have very little energy.  If I push myself past my limits, I pay for it the next couple of days.  Right now I'm too tired to even sit up straight.  I get mentally drained too.  I don't see how I'm supposed to get a job when I'm stuck in this loop. 
had	anymore	had a really traumatic childhood and bad time through adolescence.  have severe anxiety and depression.  had treatment in the past but it's never been for ptsd. my first appointment was today and it explains so much why i'm the way i am.  but to be frank i am sick and tired of the way life is.  everyday is fearful for me yet i'm in a safe environment now.  it's bizarre.  if this doesn't help in the next 6-7 sessions i don't know where to turn to anymore
Bear	it.	Bear with me this might be hard to describe. . .  but all my life I’ve always felt like I need to get “somewhere” I’m not sure where, when, what, how, or why but almost like I’m anxious to just skip ahead to tomorrow even though nothing is different about tomorrow, like there’s something I need to get to but it’s just a feeling. I’ve really sorted a lot of toxic crap out of my life and I finally recognize this feeling I’ve always felt since my traumas happened and I’m not sure if I’m just kookoo or if it’s a “PTSD thing”Edit: it’s comforting to know it’s not just me that experiences this and it could be related to my PTSD and could potentially go away with my EMDR.  Thanks for the suggestions of meditation, which I’m horrible at but I’ll definitely keep at it. 
Any	be.	Any females who experienced abuse revert back into being timid/girly/or young?I used to love edgy/goofy/cool styles but slowly I converted to loving pink/cutesy things/girly/soft styles and just in general all things girly and frilly. I’m 27 and feel like I’m acting like a teenage girl again with my style.  Idk if it’s okay to embrace that since it’s comforting or if it’s something I should be careful with. I even find myself acting that way in relationships now too? This is embarrassing but the whole baby girl thing/being protected is so appealing to me now.  I don’t want to be a kid or act like one but I do tend to attract to taking on a super submissive or timid like role? BlahEdit: To the person who DM’s asking if I wanted to be your baby girl. .  How tasteless can you possibly be. 
I	you!	I start therapy tomorrow and I am so nervous I don’t know what to expect! Any tips? Thank you!
Fuck.	much.	Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck it that's all I can fucking say.  FUCK.  Do you know what I mean? Please fuck please if one fucking person could just know what I fucking mean for fucking once.  No one fucking understands, and how could they. I'm so fucking tired.  I don't want awkward silence.  I don't want fucking frowny emoji faces.  I just want one person who understands. Edit: Thank you all so much. 
It's hard being so young with a PTSD diagnosis	everyone, myself included, is inclined to dismiss me	Sometimes I can't help but feel like I don't deserve to be diagnosed with PTSD.  I can't help but compare my situation with that of veterans, domestic violence survivors or rape survivors feel like I don't deserve to be as traumatized by what happened to me as I am.  I had a college classmate that I was becoming friendly with, come up behind me, grab me by my throat and drag me backwards, completely unprovoked.  My college refused to protect me and tried to get him a private attorney to fight my charges against him in court.   <e1> It's hard being so young with a PTSD diagnosis </e1>  because  <e2> everyone, myself included, is inclined to dismiss me </e2>  and say I'm too young to have gone through enough trauma to induce PTSD.  Does anyone have some advice for how to overcome this feeling?Edit: Thank you so much for the gold! Seriously made a darker day brighter :)
Friday	everything	Friday I I have a session booked with my psychologist. . She asked what I want to speak about, I told her I want to speak about my childhood trauma, she didn’t know I had any. .  she was all cool with it, and then said “you go girl”. .  annnnnd I’ve been absolutely up and down since. . She called out of the blue, and I answered, I actually answered, she was so proud of me and I was proud to. . I think I’m ready to stop avoiding everything
I'm not sure if it's	I know this month is generally very bad for me	Does anyone else feel like they really want human connection, but get very annoyed or feel full of rage for no real reason? I'm playing a game with my friend, but everything he says is immediately irritating me.   <e1> I'm not sure if it's </e1>  because  <e2> I know this month is generally very bad for me </e2>  and my ptsd is heightened or what, I know I feel horrible for feeling this way when my friend hasn't done anything wrong. . . . . 
Someone	from.	Someone came over today that I used to be close with. . .  But having them over made me realize how disconnected I am from people.  How poorly I tried to keep communicating with them. . .  I realized how disconnected I am from people like my partner and even my own child. . .  That I feel nothing at all for them.  I realized that when you spend every day trying to go day by day. . .  That when you spend so long just trying to survive that you lose touch of things that are key parts of normal society.  Things like just talking with friends become so distant in your mind when you have to focus all of your energy on trying to seem normal to everyone else when in reality you are far from. 
And	reading!	And also when you're upset, you react a way very similar to a young child?I just wondered if this is a normal thing to do? I'm not sure if this makes much sense.  But like when I'm extremely overwhelmed and upset, I don't do this, but my brain says/instinct is very much to throw a tantrum like a child.  I'm extremely embarrassed by this reaction.  I've explained calmly and like an adult to my boyfriend that this is how my brain is when I'm pushed beyond my means and he's very understanding about it but I just want to know why and if other people have a similar experience?I also still very much enjoy cartoons and cute things and toys and stuffed animals like children do.  I'm an art student and have nerdy interests so most people don't really think twice about my interests.  I'm just really decorated and colorful and have stuff all over my bags, car, room etc.  I just find it so much safer and I don't really have much of an interest in most traditionally adult things.  Sorry for the rant but I'd just like some insight, I suppose. Thank you for reading!
Wondering	anxiety.	Wondering if anyone else is struggling returning to work since the pandemic.  I’ve noticed since the shut down I’m more easily burnt out and agitated.  I’m having a hard time finding a job that allows for a flexible schedule to accommodate days when I have heavy flare ups or triggers, that also pays enough to pay my bills.  The masks make it even worse with my anxiety. 
And also any advice on how to keep myself from slipping into that state would also be appreciated,	none of the professionally suggested methods seem to work	It happens to me a lot where I'll start feeling myself disconnecting. . .  And when my now fiance touches me to get my attention, I jerk so bad, and get an adrenaline rush, and feel almost like I've got whiplash from being pulled back, if that makes sense?    Like tonight, I was crocheting and just felt myself drifting away.  I was still crocheting, but I was on autopilot, not hearing what my fiance was saying, not hearing our cats meowing, nothing.  Felt like I wasn't there.    But then he got worried and put a hand on my thigh to get my attention and I straight up threw my project and whipped toward him all tensed up.     I'm just wondering if this sort of disconnected, drifting, extremely startled thing is something other people are experiencing, too. . .   <e1> And also any advice on how to keep myself from slipping into that state would also be appreciated, </e1>   because  <e2> none of the professionally suggested methods seem to work </e2> ??
I'm	brave.	I'm tired of 'being brave' Every choice I make? Between life and death Or the road to life? Or of life vs.  The road toward death.  So easy to travel toward death.  But the only way I'm ever going to feel happy is to take the road to life, Very shiny, and brightness hurts my eyes, And there are people out there, That is such a drag, So, I need to be brave, And I'm tired of being brave. 
Hi	Thanks.	Hi guys.  I have depression, anxiety and panic.  I’m on Vensir and have been going to CBT for about 10 months.  My therapist and I started focusing on trauma.  We released that I have PTSD. We did a series of reliving and reprocessing exercises.  I had a positive realisation during my last session and feel like I am starting to really overcome and rewrite the end of this memory.  However since that session I have become deeply depressed. Is this common? Is it common to have depression/anxiety flare after trauma work? Why do I feel so depressed when I’ve actually had a very positive trauma therapy session? Sorry if these questions are stupid, I’ve never worked on my trauma before and I’m feeling so depressed. Thanks. 
I	question)	I came out told one of my friends I've been diagnosed with PTSD, yet they continue making jokes whenever they see images or videos of war or even just sirens.  (lucky for me my ptsd wasn't caused by that type of thing) They made a joke when a volunteer fire department siren was going off (thankfully one of my triggers is a different type of siren) but I lost it and explained in detail exactly how it feels.  The jokes have become less frequent but now I'm  afraid that people won't take my triggers seriously when I tell them.  I was just wondering if this has happened to anyone else or if I just have shitty friends :/ (sorry if this is a dumb question)
Prior	PhD	Prior to the occurrence of traumatic events, there are generally certain basic assumptions that guide your life.  You probably believe that the world is kind, that there is meaning to your life, and that things make sense.  You believe that you are good and worthy of having good things happen to you.  Then trauma strikes.  It seems as though you are no longer in control of what has happened around you.  You're vulnerable and your world is no longer safe and secure.  Furthermore, you can't make sense of what is left over.  The meaning of life that you recognized just a short time before is gone.  Now life is no longer fair and just. -The PTSD Workbook, third edition by Mary Beth Williams, PhD, LCSW, CTS and Soili Poijula, PhD
got myself all the ingredients for a lovely bath and a nice pasta dish for lunch	I couldn’t bring myself to cook	I’m having a moment every now and then today, but I went out,  <e1> got myself all the ingredients for a lovely bath and a nice pasta dish for lunch </e1>  because  <e2> I couldn’t bring myself to cook </e2>   and some nice cupcakes.  This time last year I was having a breakdown in the back room of a store and so even though it’s still hard I’m actually super happy that I didn’t have a complete breakdown!!! Small victories :))
no luck	how hard I was hit by the side effects	I’ve tried Celexa, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft with  <e1> no luck </e1>  due to  <e2> how hard I was hit by the side effects </e2>  .  I was told that since I’ve had three failed attempts, my insurance would cover a DNA test to see which meds I’m most compatible with but I needed something in the meantime.  Yesterday, in a bit of a funk, I went to my local head shop and bought a new vape and a bottle of 1200mg CBD juice, and- HOLY SHIT- the difference! This has changed everything in less than 24 hours and I am so humbled and grateful at the peace I’m finally getting.  ??
I’ve	me.	I’ve been abused in the past by people who were nice to me to manipulate me and it’s still painful and confusing to remember both the happy memories and the abuse that took place. So now whenever I get along well with someone I can’t shake the idea that they might have ulterior motives, that they secretly dislike me or that they’ll start disliking me once they really get to know me and the whole thing will do a 180.  I feel incredibly isolated and like I have no solid ground to stand onEDIT: Thank you for the responses.  It means a lot to me. 
Hey	it!	Hey everyone,Long story short-- traumatic event happened 9 years ago (series of events).  After surviving it, I was treated for 8 years on sertraline for OCD and excessive worry (confirmed by two therapists in the past 8 years), but it was only this summer that, after a massive trigger, I sought a therapist, who ended up treating it as PTSD.  Then, this summer, we worked on it via cognitive processing therapy. It wasn't easy, and it wasn't always pleasant, but I feel better, and I am processing/thinking about the experience better. Thank you to my therapist! I want to just post this as a post of encouragement for all of you on this sub. .  I still have some stuff to work out, but I am finally at peace with certain aspects of the trauma, and its effects are much milder. Keep at it!
I	hard	I am gonna start therapy again and try zoloft againi have tried to convince myself i can be a work machine and be fine.   i tried to convince myself i would be ok without therapy or i couldnt afford iti need to work a lot to pay off debt and pay bills but i probably need to support my soul too.   i will probably be more motivated to work and achieve goals if i can sprinkle some happy in my schedule. i am gonna do the best i can.   i am not gonna expect to heal 100% or be happy all the time but im gonna try to insert a bit more joy into my lifethis year has been really hard
Today	out.	Today I broke down crying for the first time in 4 years.  Don’t think I would have had it not been for some horrible combination of illness, exhaustion and asking my therapist what I’ve struggled with for years and that’s not why but how.   How could my older sibling do that to me? I can understand if you hate someone you do hateful stuff to them, not agree but it makes sense.  I don’t understand how someone can be so normal to you 80-90% of the time: They’re the older sibling they look out for you, they stick up for you to your parents and the other kids, and yet also be the person who goes into your room at night and molests you. Then the next day they sit down opposite you for breakfast, and smile at you like it’s a normal day.  Like you’re normal people.  I got as far asking and then just cried and felt like that same scared and confused kid who didn’t and still doesn’t understand how or why.  Feels almost good to let it out. 
have someone help you through emotional turbulence	everyone’s stressed so I feel unsafe and anxious	Just feeling defeated it’s hard during this time not being able to get comfort or  <e1> have someone help you through emotional turbulence </e1>  because  <e2> everyone’s stressed so I feel unsafe and anxious </e2> .  Also dealing with trying to find a medication to finally alleviate my depression that I’ve been stuck in for a few years. Just looking for hopeful uplifting motivating stories and advice from you guys who consider themselves actually happy
I feel bad for not wanting to	at one time his friendship was really important to me	So in 2019 I was living in a town where I didn’t know anyone.  I met a new friend, first online and then in person, and we spent the whole year hanging out and talking.  He became a good friend to me at a time when I needed one. However, I moved back home later that year and we only spoke in text.  I invited him to stay at my home for the weekend, and our time together was so different.  I’m afraid that I wasn’t a very good host; I found him boring. Now he keeps asking me to come and visit him, to make a three hour drive to his home.   <e1> I feel bad for not wanting to </e1> , because  <e2> at one time his friendship was really important to me </e2> .  I leaned on him when I needed to but now that I don’t need his support or friendship, I don’t talk to him as much.  And I feel like this makes me a bad person. There’s nothing wrong with him, he’s a lovely and generous person. 
I	Thanks.	I have this issue of flashbacks constantly infiltrating my mind.  I’m doing a lot better in terms of all other areas but this issue seems to be the most persistent.  I was on Zoloft but it gave me acid reflux issues so I had to stop taking it.  I do plan on seeing a doc again but for now I’m curious if anyone has found a medication that helped with this.  Thanks. 
Opportunities	grow?	Opportunities lost, poor choices. . . emotional decisions.  People you were afraid to talk to.  My life is all one big regret.  How do you move on from your own regrets as you grow older and your regrets grow?
TW	suffering.	TW AbuseWhat I mean is that even though my family abused me for my entire 18 years with them, I'm strangely haunted by the trauma I can't remember. For example, when I was in the first grade, I felt extremely uncomfortable in all off my clothes-- paranoid that I looked fat and ugly.  I can't remember being told so that young, but shame was always on my mind.  How did I have so much shame so young? Even at 5 or 6 years old I was always ashamed of myself.  My mind is always wondering what did they do to me when I was that young that I can't remember?.  There's something off-putting to me in knowing that beneath all the trauma I remember, there is likely more.  Like some sick iceberg of suffering. 
I'm not careful I find myself waiting on them, putting my life on hold and then resenting them	not being available despite never even discussing it	It's like I'm constantly disappointed that I can't spend more time with them, or I'm disappointed if we don't have a ridiculously-great time and afterwards I sit there wondering what went wrong.   <e1> I'm not careful I find myself waiting on them, putting my life on hold and then resenting them </e1>  for  <e2> not being available despite never even discussing it </e2> . This is a nightmare.  I'm not used to having awesome people in my life, so I guess I grab on with both hands and constantly low-key panic that they'll leave.  Last night I had a dream about one of them leaving forever and never being able to see or contact them again, and I realised that's probably my biggest current fear. 
Can't	up???	Can't stop thinking that I was either given alcohol and/ or drugged as a child as part of my CSA but I have no actual concrete memory of this happening.  I don't explicitly know that it happened; it's just a feeling I keep having and my lifelong paranoia about being drugged.  I've always inherently been afraid of accepting drinks/ food/ medicine from people, too.  Even family members.  . . .  I don't know if it's just me or if this actually happened and it's driving me insane.  Do I just trust myself??? Or am I making it up???
Hello	CPTSD?	Hello all! I've got a pretty simple question, I guess. . . Around the Internet, I've seen mentions of self-triggering.  But one of the primary marks of PTSD in the DSM-5 is avoidance of triggering things, and I assume the same logic applies to CPTSD.  I match up eerily well to CPTSD, but I feel like I couldn't have it if I do sometimes trigger myself?For example, I have ADHD (diagnosed) and when I get bored or too disjointed to attempt to focus, I often find myself scrolling through memes, infographics, etc.  of a triggering nature and/or I'll listen to sad music that only boosts the depression. . . .  until I breakdown or dissociate. So, tl;dr, is self-triggering a thing within the realm of CPTSD?
I	idk.	I am a 15-year-old child in care (UK) with no freedom whatsoever.  Can't browse internet unless at school, and most websites are blocked.  Can't play violent video games.  Can't play video games or watch television alone.  Can't go out unsupervised.  Can't spend money unsupervised.  Can't ride a bicycle.  I am extremely depressed and have very violent outbursts of anger.  Whenever I try venting about my problems people tell me just speak to your social worker but nothing works.  I have felt like this for 2 and a half years straight.  No chance of escape for another 3 years or so.  I have no friends or family to turn to. Sensors don't understand that I'm an INTP 4w5.  I need the internet 24/7 unrestricted and unsupervised to keep me happy.  I need freedom.  FUCK THOSE SENSORS!! CALLING ALL INTUITIVES, PLEASE JOIN MY CULT! MURDER ALL SENSORS! SACRIFICE THEM TO OUR GOD CARL JUNG!All I do to try and kill my time is journal, solve puzzles, daydream, cry, sleep, listen to music, play on my Nintendo DS, idk. 
I am crying right now	I didn’t think it would be possible for my mind to come back from disassociation and cycles of depression/manic like behavior	Unlike so many other failed attempts, I didn’t let cptsd or bipolar or adhd (or whatever combination of mental illness it might be) hinder me from passing!A B- with trauma might as well be an A haha that’s how proud I am right now for finishing my first college course since lifted academic suspension.   <e1> I am crying right now </e1>  because  <e2> I didn’t think it would be possible for my mind to come back from disassociation and cycles of depression/manic like behavior </e2> , but I took my meds, I continued therapy, I stayed away from my primary parental abuser, and I did it.   I showed up for myself everyday & I finished!
I'm stunted at a certain age emotionally	trauma	  <e1> I'm stunted at a certain age emotionally </e1>  due to  <e2> trauma </e2>  , and ironically I also look really young for my age.  Maybe my body needs to overcome the trauma in order for me to grow up.  I'm not complaining about not looking older though.  I don't mind it but I'm just wondering if there is a connection.  I have no underlying conditions & my physically health is fine as far as I know.  I'm 27 (male) but I look like I'm 17.  I have no hormonal problems either. 
if I’m in the hyper hyper arousal flashback state	it’s almost impossible to calm myself down with breath or meditation cos your body is in high alert	My therapist says for people with CPTSD mindfulness meditation might bring people to dissociate.  I guess he said so cos I score high on the dissociation scale.  The thing is I don’t even know if I’m dissociating or not(still can’t figure it out, maybe I do it so often). . . shouldn’t be mindfulness helpful as it brings us to the present moment and be aware of the body? How do I know it’s making me dissociate instead?I find that  <e1> if I’m in the hyper hyper arousal flashback state </e1>    <e2> it’s almost impossible to calm myself down with breath or meditation cos your body is in high alert </e2>  and that is a very primitive feeling that cannot be stopped.  In that case talking to a supportive person and doing movement things help much more. I have tried to do somatic meditation from Susie Baxter but it freaked me out cos I don’t really trust my body. The closest thing I can think of is that state where you can’t feel your body anymore and your brain seperate from your body.  That happens during meditation when my body shuts down and is heavy as a rock and it feels like a giant meat blanket kinda thing. 
I understand	she had a family emergency	  <e1> I understand </e1>  because  <e2> she had a family emergency </e2>  , but I've not been doing very well mentally the past couple weeks.  I don't want to bother her too much (already sent an email asking when she felt like she'd be okay to hold sessions again like a week ago.  No reply yet. ) but I've been really low with stress, anxiety and trying to figure things out.  I'd really prefer not to try to get a new therapist as I've been really making progress on healing and understanding myself & my fucked up, emotionally abused childhood. Could talk to close family I guess, but most of them would probably just be like It'll be okay.  Or Just relax, it'll work out, it is what it is type of responses, which I really really do not need right now.  I've been using that mentality most my life and I'm sick of it. 
I	in-depth.	I moved a year ago and my new room’s lock didn’t work.  It was weird but I didn’t question it.  I brought it up recently and she said she made sure the lock didn’t work, and was glad I chose that room.  I asked why and she said she’s paranoid about me killing myself.  It sounds odd to me but I may be looking too in-depth. 
I’m	end.	I’m usually good at coping with Mother’s Day pain but this year sucks.  I’ve been sad and aching all day.  ?Can’t wait for this day to end. 
I	life.	I had made a rather telling post on r/mentalillness about my brother and how I was worried about him.  I deleted it yesterday but it garnered a lot of attention that I didn't really expect and as much as I regret making the post for the million questions and criticisms I recieved, I am glad I now know what to do about my brother. I don't really know why I went on there to ask for advice, but I didn't know where else to post about my specific issue.  Earlier I woke up to find a comment about something I described on a different post only to find it deleted and I'm wondering if maybe I should delete my account to avoid further comments like that. . . I made a report finally though, and I'm having panic attacks left and right the last week. I feel regret for not doing anything sooner about him, but what was I going to do about my brother when my parents never addressed anything I told them about? I realize there's only so much I can do when I'm not a legal guardian and still figuring out my own life. 
Mother's Day is something my abusers care about way more than I do	if I'm feeling down about it, they probably feel worse	It just occurred to me that  <e1> Mother's Day is something my abusers care about way more than I do </e1> , and that therefore  <e2> if I'm feeling down about it, they probably feel worse </e2> .  Hugs for anyone having a hard time today. 
I'm	reaction	I'm on better help for therapy (I know some people don't like the site but it is the only thing available for me at the moment) My therapist has been telling me to keep a journal and on the site they have a digital journal you can keep and you can share the posts with your therapist.  I wasn't having a bad night or anything but I wanted to give writing in a journal an honest shot.  So I did a complete mind dump just wrote everything that came to mind and I shared it with her She messaged me this morning with some insite into what I wrote and then asked if I was in crisis ? Jesus Christ if that mind dump and an okay night triggered her asking that I can only imagine what my brain would write on a bad day I'm not mad at her she was genuinely concerned it just surprised me that she had that reaction
Feel	going.	Feel confusedHave no sex driveNo feeling to have intimacy. But I am majorly depressed.  I have generalised anxity.  I hear thoughts from my parents to not have sex actually.  I've gone to the hospital once.  I didn't tell them my parents are in cults though.  My mom says no need to be happy when the end is near.  She drinks a lot.  She plays loud music.  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I do t get it.  I have so been diagnosed with BPD and I'm going to look in to that.  I just want to vent but I need someone to tell me to keep going. 
I feel sad	I’m dreading Father’s Day	Now, I have a wonderful mother and she is nothing like my abusive father.  Thank God they got a divorce over 20 years ago, but I just feel sad today I saw her had plans with her and it was an alright time but I just feel sad.  why do  <e1> I feel sad </e1> ? I think it’s because  <e2> I’m dreading Father’s Day </e2>  and that I don’t even want to do anything for him this year. 
Talk	:/	Talk about trying not to feel guilty and trying to reparent myself when all of society is so keen on reminding me about my dysfunctional childhood :/
they get offended	they couldn’t possibly not know everything there is to know about your illness	After telling you everything (they know) about your illness they tell you all the people that they know that have PTSD.  When you try to explain the differences between PTSD and CPTSD  <e1> they get offended </e1>  because  <e2> they couldn’t possibly not know everything there is to know about your illness </e2>  .  ??♀?
Every	similar?	Every day I have a few violent fantasies play out in my head where I beat the life out of my mother and stepfather.  Every time this happens I twitch out and punch my hand or just twitch a bit with my whole body.  I wouldn't actually hurt anyone but sometimes for a few seconds I'm just not really here and then I'm just really tired.  I feel like as a teenager this helped a little bit but now all it does is remind me of people who I've now just considered dead to me.  Does anyone else go through similar?
I liked playing with them with my niece	that was her favorite thing	Fist memory of it was my 10th birthday.  I asked her little animal figurine toys. Realizing the day of my birthday I really didn't want that.   <e1> I liked playing with them with my niece </e1>  but that was because  <e2> that was her favorite thing </e2>  .  Realized I was too old for them, out grew them. On my birthday that was the only thing I got.  Was devastated and embarrassed.  Deeply dreaded my birthday ever since. Asked my mother about returning them to the store but couldn't take the disappointment of the people who gave them to me and facing them if it came up.  was a mess emotionally.  Did end up keeping them for my niece to play with when she came over. 
this and other trauma symptoms	my quality of work has suffered remained stagnant over the years	My therapist did mention its a PTSD thing but I'm struggling with slowing myself down.  This 'hurry' mode really became an issue during my time at art university as one of the main critiques I got from my professor was that I need to take 'more care' with my work or that I make a lot of 'careless' mistakes. This is kinda an overall issue with my personal work too.  I feel like I gotta get it done NOW or ASAP.  due to  <e1> this and other trauma symptoms </e1>    <e2> my quality of work has suffered remained stagnant over the years </e2>   and I honestly feel really disappointed in myself for it. . . . 
I may repost this on r/emotionalneglect	this may fit better there	  <e1> I may repost this on r/emotionalneglect </e1> , because  <e2> this may fit better there </e2>  .  My parents were both neglectful and abusive, but I've come to believe it was a result of their own trauma and that they do love me, but love wasn't enough to raise children successfully.  At school, I was bullied, often targeted with racism and other traumas, and I often found myself just wanting to go home.  My parents are immigrants and had their fair share of struggles moving to the other end of the earth from their home country, away from all their family and friends, and dealing with some of the same discrimination, alienation, etc.  that I experienced a version of in school. As an adult, I struggle deciding whether my parents were the main source of my trauma, or whether they were two imperfect people in a world otherwise characterized by cruelty or indifference.  I often feel afraid I'm blaming the only people in the world who were safe for me during my childhood. 
I can do something just	I enjoy it if I want	My boss let me off work early today, and I've suddenly got a whole afternoon/evening free.  I've been wracking my brain for the last hour trying to figure out what to do with myself, and have ended up mindlessly scrolling on the internet instead of getting up and doing something.  It just hit me that I was triggered by not having plans and not being able to come up with something to do (down time was not really allowed in my family without a lot of guilt attached to it), which put me in freeze mode, hence the scrolling to self-soothe. Feeling a little proud that I identified that all by myself while I was in the middle of it :) I usually can't even begin to see that I've been triggered into an emotional flashback until after I'm on the other side of it, and even then it's not very consistent.  I'll take this as a step forward!Reminder to myself: I do not have to be productive with this free time.  I can sit and do nothing if I want, or  <e1> I can do something just </e1>  because  <e2> I enjoy it if I want </e2> . 
My dad was also emotionally absent much of the time	it felt like I was a surrogate spouse for my mom	Especially other only children with no nearby or supportive extended family, like aunts, uncles, cousins or grandparents.  I mean I had aunts and uncles but I hardly saw them, and it felt awkward when I did.  Same with my grandparents.  And I had no cousins.   <e1> My dad was also emotionally absent much of the time </e1>  so  <e2> it felt like I was a surrogate spouse for my mom </e2>  .  I think this led to a huge problem with a lack of boundaries and with internalizing everything I heard to the point where I would thank my mother for verbally abusing me.  Groveling is still the only tactic I feel I can use.  I felt so trapped and still do.  I constantly switched between being the golden child and the scapegoat and I never knew which it would be.  My personality construction feels very disorganized and paradoxical. I know having siblings doesn’t make it any better and there are unique challenges that come with that as well, but I was just wondering if anyone else was an only child and what their experience was. 
I am the way I am	how my mother treated me	I experienced something a couple of weeks ago which I now realize could be utilized as a technique in shifting shame to blame, maybe someone finds it useful. Basically I got triggered and ended up dissociating heavily for 3 hours.  When I came back I had no idea how I had passed that time and got incredibly frustrated with myself for being so unproductive.  I was washing the dishes and I just exclaimed WHY AM I LIKE THIS? as a rhetorical question and an unhealthy invite to the inner critic to just go off. But then I repeated the question as an actual question: *Why* am I like this? and my inner critic just. . . stopped.   <e1> I am the way I am </e1>  because of  <e2> how my mother treated me </e2> .  I should not be ashamed, she has the blame.  I am doing the best I can considering the circumstances.  I should be proud. Sometimes our inner critics have these weak spots we can use to our advantage.  Sometimes all it takes is shifting the accent in a rhetorical question. 
broken brain	so much developmental trauma	After 10 years of no meds but lots of therapy which only ever helped short term, I recently went on an SSRI plus an atypical antipsychotic for a very late-in-life diagnosis of (C)PTSD & bipolar II ( <e1> broken brain </e1>  due to   <e2> so much developmental trauma </e2>  - you all get it).  Now, for the first time ever, I'm approaching a state of more consistent calm and okay-ness than I've ever experienced unmedicated.  And I just have to wonder: are all those normal people who seemed to effortlessly and happily go about their lives (while I constantly struggled not to end mine) actually just medicated?! I mean, some of them have to be, statistically. . .  but, like, most of them. . . ?! Meds or no, I still feel like this world isn't particularly conducive to coming out of childhood well-adjusted and mentally healthy, so. . . . Thoughts?!(Also: if you're on the fence about meds - I wish I'd started the process of figuring out which ones would help me 20 years ago.  But I'm happy that I have at last. )
Like	flashbacks?	Like a lot of people with CPTSD, I used to inwardly, sometimes outwardly, think that if I was a better kid I wouldn't have been abused and neglected.  Through therapy and work and reading and support like this, that changed eventually.  Now I know that I did not deserve that treatment or abuse.  NO child or adult should ever be abused or deserves abuse, NO EXCEPTIONS. Now my flashbacks, which occur during certain times of the year especially (Mothers Day - not helping) are causing rage.  Like, I want to scream.  I want to break things (but I won't as that would be scary and abusive to my spouse) - I just want revenge.  There is no closure.  When seeking closure I get gaslit.  So there is no closure, and there will be no closure, and I think that is the real cause of the rage.  It's still an open problem.  Without fixing the problem, it's just there, burning holes in me. So the healing journey - does it read: Self-hate, rage --- and then what? What comes after this? When will it be acceptance and self-love and no more unwanted flashbacks?
Hugging	CSA?	Hugging my mom makes me cringe in every cell of my body.  It feels disgusting.  It feels like what I imagine (tw) it feels like to be sexually assaulted, then have the assaulted stroke your hair.  It’s gross and I don’t know how to explain it, it feels so unnatural and gross.  But I only experienced emotional abuse and neglect from my mom as far as I knowAlso from like age 3 I’ve had some weird medical fetish.  Latex gloves and doctor check ups and stuff made me mentally turned on and I would ask a lot of questions about it with other people but then if my parents were around and I had those thoughts I felt dirtier. I also know everyone probably says this at some point but I REALLY don’t think she could have molested me, I feel like she knew right from wrong with anything like that but is it possible I can feel this disgusted with myself/her even just touching each other by accident if it wasn’t CSA?
So	wasn't.	So I had a decent day yesterday.  Felt pretty grounded (for my standards) by the time I went to bed.  Before I went on a nice walk and took a hot shower.  I felt a little restless but nothing out of the ordinary. Yet I wake up completely stressed from a weird dream at 4am and had a constant stream of negative thoughts until I fell back asleep around 7am.  Today I feel extra anxious and exhausted. This ptsd thing keeps surprising me.  I was doing fine until my body decided I wasn't. 
I can't tell if they're happy tears or sad tears	it feels like I'm giving my younger self advice	I mean like truly genuine compliments.  Not necessarily just you look great! (although that too), but like I love the way you do _____, you bring a lot of passion into _____, you inspire me kind of compliments. Whenever I'm giving works of advice and comfort to a friend, telling an artist they inspire me, telling a student I'm proud of their progress and think they'll go far, etc.  I start getting really teary and my throat closes.  I've even broken down sobbing when typing compliments (i. e.  the reciever can't see me crying).  I once went to a one-time counselling session at my university for some reason or the other and ended up showing my therapist some texts I sent to my friend cheering her on, and her kind response back, and spent the rest of the session involuntarily crying. I don't know why that is.   <e1> I can't tell if they're happy tears or sad tears </e1> .  Maybe because  <e2> it feels like I'm giving my younger self advice </e2>  ? Or am I grieving for the words I was never given? Or is it both? I don't know, but it's interesting.  Regardless, I do try to compliment liberally. Anyone else?
i feel really dumb sometimes	i find it unnecessarily hard to function properly without certain rules and stuff	  <e1> i feel really dumb sometimes </e1>  because ,  <e2> i find it unnecessarily hard to function properly without certain rules and stuff  </e2>  ?? my dad was really mean and specific about certain things like eating and sleeping and i find it really hard to make decisions without somebody telling me what to do.  i feel like if i don't get permission to sleep or if i eat in-between meals, dad will know and he'll find me and hit me?? i know it's irrational but i get really nervous doing things without certain orders in place,, it's getting worse as i remember more about my childhood,,,, i can't even decide whether to eat or not without flipping a coin and i HAVE to listen to the outcome or he'll know and hurt me.  idk it feels childish :(
Frisson	me.	Frisson is when you get goosebumps listening to music, when it activates the brains pleasure centre.  I do experience this with some songs - Still by Seinabo Sey, or randomly Amazing Grace played on the bagpipes (lol what?), or Fire by Sam Smith.  I recognise they are beautiful soul igniting songs, but I can't tell if it's so melodically overwhelming to me, or if perhaps I'll never feel the level of love and emotion that these people are singing about, towards another person, but I wanted to die when I first heard these melodies.  My heart actually ached and I felt like I was at a peak, emotionally, and that the come down and back-to-reality was too much. Does anyone experience the same?To note, this intense feeling goes away after I listen to the song a few times.  But it's that first listening experience that gets me. 
I already feel like cringing myself into the next plane	sharing my struggling with someone close makes me wanna die	I've been isolating HARD recently and she messaged me a couple days ago saying she felt ''distant'' from me, I panicked and retreated further into my shell for a few days.  Finally worked up the nuts to send her a message, basically just apologizing for being off the radar and explaining I'm not doing so hot right now, but she's also quite hit and miss in terms of being online seeing as she has an actual job so now the message has been hanging in the air for hours and I'm getting more and more stressed about it.   <e1> I already feel like cringing myself into the next plane </e1>  because  <e2> sharing my struggling with someone close makes me wanna die </e2> , but agh I'm just so nervous, I've done this multiple times and every time I said I was gonna do better and every time I've only managed to get worse, it's so fucking difficult just to keep afloat right now nevermind actively improve myself and I just know it's gonna be one too many disappointments one of these days bc I've already had way more chances than I deserve
Tomorrow	do?	Tomorrow a person who triggers a lot of my anxiety, is coming to my work to do golfing.  While he will not be in my direct vicinity, I will constantly be on high alert/feeling anxious for my shift, since there’s an entire 18 holed golf course here.  I’m scared. and. . . On Sunday there’s a party going on the entire day, and naturally, loud noises and many people will be scaring the shit out of me, especially now that I’m told guests will occasionally enter the room I will be hiding in, to see my friends’ cool room (I live in there for now), and I will have to deal with small talk with absolute strangers.  (My friend promises to be there and try to run interference, but I will still have random interruptions) Could I go outside during this? Usually yes but itll be very hot and I wont know when the party will end nor do I have friends here I could visit. This ptsd shit sucks guys.  10/10 do not recommend. Tf do I do?
The	miserable.	The title says it all.  Whenever I get jealous I basically tell myself suck it up, this isn't helping you.  My question is, am i doing more harm by repressing jealousy/envy? I tried to let the emotion run its course but it makes me bitter and miserable. 
it's tiring	being anxious and depressed	this shit is annoying and i hate that my tears will just roll down in the wrong moments instead of whenever i'm alone,  <e1> it's tiring </e1>   <e2> being anxious and depressed </e2> . . . 
there's a bit of guilt	not picking it up when i pick stuff like that up with other people	well firstly  <e1> there's a bit of guilt </e1>  there for  <e2> not picking it up when i pick stuff like that up with other people </e2> .  so he told me mw about it this morning and i don't know what to say to him.  i just said that i'm glad he's getting help and that i'll check in on him more often.  we're not extremely close but i want to be there for him.  i just don't know how
im	be	im losing the battle, but i used to write songs and poetry to cope.  reddit amateur here, if i break rules dont be afraid to tell me.  this is just for anyone in a similar situation, any critique/thoughts on the poem would help.  thankssad truthsdead flowers left with nothing but weeds like how your wants banish your needs life lived by the rules a tortured soul born to lose how many hints to take? how many clues? mind games play you sun shines when your down then sets when your up after the fall its hard to move on when you cant move at all maybes just the echo of never meant to be

18	guys?	18 years old.  was super energetic and happy all the time as a kid.  made over 130k as a teenager in a hobby i love.  i have a decent social life, small yet close friend circle, and a close family.  why the fuck do i feel so fucking sad and tired all the time.  i just feel fucking empty.  idk why, and idk if this is even depression but it's bullshit, how can i treat this or fix it.  are there strategies i can use? any advice from you guys?
i	worse.	i can't remember what joy feels like.  i can act out the approximation of it but i can't, for the life of me, remember what it's like to really be happy or excited about something. i don't have the energy to talk to my wife about this but i know she can see it.  knowing that makes it so much worse. 
it's not their fault	i can't really be mad at other people for having better connections with another person	i mean,  <e1> it's not their fault </e1> .   <e2> i can't really be mad at other people for having better connections with another person </e2> .  i just wish i had someone i could call my best friend, and have them do the same. . . 
trapping me in the hypothetical mental state of permanently worrying about others over myself	i now get to live a happy and successful life	it's always some great 1 off line that they think is the secret to fixing everything. just love yourself! - sure let me just go do that real quick. you have so much more time, things will get better! - lot more time for things to get worse too :)you'd be disappointing your family, etc - ah yes, by  <e1> trapping me in the hypothetical mental state of permanently worrying about others over myself </e1> ,  <e2> i now get to live a happy and successful life </e2> , thank you. really appreciate it, thank you. 
i'm tired all the time	everything doesn't seem to excite me anymore	i hate how people who i thought knew better tell me that i'm lazy, i'm not.  i wanna get up and be excited to do stuff but i'm just not.   <e1> i'm tired all the time </e1>  and  <e2> everything doesn't seem to excite me anymore </e2> . 
i'm excited to get out of reality	i don't have to consciously do anything	dreams are always fantastical situations for me.  they're strange and whatever, but there's always a new one and  <e1> i'm excited to get out of reality </e1> .  plus  <e2> i don't have to consciously do anything </e2> , but it still feels like i did everything. 
everything i do sooner or later becomes another chore	no happiness, no joy	it never ends.   <e1> everything i do sooner or later becomes another chore </e1> .   <e2> no happiness, no joy </e2> .  just nothing.  i sat down between reps to my chair, and wondered about suicide for 5 minutes.  fuck everyone who says eating healthy or exercise could fix this shit.  sometimes it just cant.  and it makes you more miserable. 
i	happy.	i dunno.  nothing excites me anymore.  i wake up and i dont know what to look forward to.  im not having any suicidal thoughts and i dont think i ever will, but im really struggling to feel happy. 
theyre also being inconsiderate by assuming im just choosing to fail my classes	i feel the lowest ive ever felt right now	everyone says try harder or i know you can do it and all i wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up.  i cant try harder and i cant do it, if i could i obviously would.  i know they care but  <e1> theyre also being inconsiderate by assuming im just choosing to fail my classes </e1> .  ive been struggling with depression for a few years,  <e2> i feel the lowest ive ever felt right now </e2> .  ive in therapy and i take meds and i still cant handle all the pressure and responsibilities of living.  depression kills :/ edit wow, i did not expect this to reach so many people.  i have read any single kind comment everyone has left, sorry if i havent replied immediately im trying.  i really appreciate every beautiful soul giving me words of encouragement.  for anyone going through the same bs as i am, i just wanna let you know itll get better.  i feel as you do, so hopeless and tired.  but this is the moment we need to preserve more than ever.  i wish everyone to sees this the best of luck in your battle against the fights life throws at you.  <3

i feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that i have to constantly argue with	its exhausting	im not saying gun to my head thoughts.  i mean like, driving down the road and once in a while my brain says just turn into the opposite lane.  itll look like an accident but then i just shake it off.  or shaving my legs and think just cut, bleed out, its so easy but i never actually act on these things.  theyve just become a part of my life.   <e1> i feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that i have to constantly argue with </e1> .   <e2> its exhausting </e2> .

hello	normal?	hello maybe someone can help me unerstand or at least give me some advice.  basically i think i suffered from depression about two years ago i was never diagnosed but from my knowledge it was at least something close to it and it lasted for about a year or two i'm not really sure about that.  but the thing is that i still get these depressive episodes sometimes they come after a week of being very happy and motivated but sometimes they just come out of nowhere like one day i'm super happy and the next it's just emptiness that develops to sadnes the longer it goes on.  they don't really have a pattern it just comes out of nowhere.  they aren't always bad but sometimes the only way i can make myself feel better by doing some destructive habits though i only started doing ir recently.  so does anyone know what going on? or is this normal?

for the past four years i've been fighting my own personality, interests, and sexuality	my fragile sense of pride, i have little inner-motivation to better myself	hello everyone,not sure what the point of writing this is.   when i feel overwhelmed nothing else matters.   i can't accept advice for more than a few days.   after that i regress and return to my old ways.   it seems like i'm addicted to shoving my problems away, facing them for a little, and then stumbling into the void again.   rinse and repeat.   when i feel myself getting better and growing optimistic, pressure builds up inside me until i give in. i've wanted to leak out this baggage in-person gradually to family and friends, but i'm too scared.   life's always been an uphill battle with my insecurities but recently they've consumed everything.    <e1> for the past four years i've been fighting my own personality, interests, and sexuality </e1> .   because of  <e2> my fragile sense of pride, i have little inner-motivation to better myself </e2> .   i might not express it in public, but i've never doubted myself as much as i do now.

luckily the doctor appointment was cancelled	covid	so, ive been really depressed since about november 2020.   so for about 7 months ive been depressed and suicidal.  my brother was diagnosed with depression 2 years ago, i was younger then and didnt know much about depression.  my mom get him all the help she could.  therapy,antidepressants, sleeping pills, etc.  i have a lot of similar symptoms to my brother.  although im years younger (im a teenager his 21. ) more of my depression symptoms have been showing psychically for my mom to see in plain sight.  -not sleeping, sleeping all day, crying for hours,not eating, not making any interaction, not talking to people,not getting out of bed, etc.  it seems as if she completely blind sighted.  i had a really bad toothache a week ago, and she was going to take me to doctor for it.  she also said shed ask the doctor about how im sleeping all day, or not ever.   <e1> luckily the doctor appointment was cancelled </e1>  due to  <e2> covid </e2>  they gave me medicine for the toothache, but i dont know if the question she wouldve asked the doctor was about me being depressed, or just a possible diagnosis of insomnia?
i	here	i just cant keep feeling like this.  i cant do it ive felt like this for almost a year now im a miserable failure i know people would miss me but i cant suffer anymore or stick around any longer i just feel too bad.  i cant stand myself i hate myself so fucking much i wish somebody else could of had my life where cant i kill my self i just cant keep posting here

ive	much.	ive been dealing with major depression since i was 13 and over the years its gotten worse. i was also in denial for a long time about how bad its been. ive done a lot of self work but it feels like it's never enough and maybe being a depressed person is just who i am and i can only change that so much. 
hey	you.	hey all, i am a 24f who has dealt with depression for about 9 years with varying severity.  i am currently on effexor after trying a bunch of meds and stable enough that i've held down a ft job for 3. 5 years and now have a live-in partner. the details of my days, however, aren't great.  i don't have energy or desire for hobbies beyond cooking dinner sometimes and watching an evening tv show with my boyfriend.  i often find myself mentally exhausted and ready to shut down either at 5pm after work or later on around 8. 30/9pm.  it gets worse on days when i've struggled with negative thoughts. my partner doesn't really like how i go to bed early a lot, and is hurt that i dont want to stay up and spend time with him.  i want to not always be so tired.  after getting bloodwork done last week i know this is 100% psychological- my dr.  knew about my fatigue but said my results were great.  i'd like to be the kind of person who goes to the gym or for a walk after work but i always feel too heavy and sad. i often don't want to be awake if i could just be asleep and escape feeling sad/ negative/ tired.  what can i do to fix this? has anyone been in a similar situation? thank you. 
im	exactly.	im not sure if its a depressive episode but ive been feeling a little malaise over the past week or so and now all my emotions, primarily sadness, seem to be coming back and im having trouble controlling it or knowing why im sad exactly. 
this song resonated hard for me today particularly the chorus	it's true	killswitch engaged-this fire burns.   <e1> this song resonated hard for me today particularly the chorus </e1>  cause  <e2> it's true </e2>  it's something i know about myself and if you're in the same boat it's something you need to know about yourself too.  that no matter how bad you feel, you have something deep down in yourself that burns and fuels you to keep going, no matter what.  that's your soul screaming out that no matter how dark things may seem there's a light inside of you that wont quit.  literally fucking screaming that i will not give up.  have a beautiful day!
how	hopeless	how do people work eight hours a day im laying on my floor forcing myself to eat a bagel i used all my effort to make.  im 17 almost at the age where i have to be an adult life hurts i wish i didnt have to do it.  im truly hopeless
sorry	it.	sorry if this is not an appropriate question.  i've been feeling very depressed but i'll probably someday regret it if i do this and keep scars from it. 
i finally found other people who are depressed	they actually understand what im saying	ive been depressed for as long as i can remember.  i used to see a therapist, and he asked me when was the last time i was happy.  i honestly couldnt even think of a time that i was happy.  not even when i was a kid or anything.  i asked my girlfriend about it and she said shes almost always happy.  wtf does that mean? i cant imagine that. anyway.  how am i supposed to talk to a therapist about how hopeless everything is when the therapist has never been depressed? if you havent been through it, then you cant understand it.  i dont want to get out of bed.  nothing is interesting.  i just want to sleep forever. ill tell you what has actually started helping me.  i found an app that pairs you up with people who have the same problems as you.   <e1> i finally found other people who are depressed </e1>  so  <e2> they actually understand what im saying </e2> .  it hasnt fixed everything, but at least its nice to talk.  if anyone else thinks it could help them, here it is:  apple. com/us/app/hear-4-you/id1539679878
i'm really sorry that i am replying to the comments and messages	it is a little overwhelming for me right now	i have depression, my partner of 5 years knows it well.  things are not going well with me in life.  i used to do self harm before i started my treatment.  i'm jobless and cannot afford therapy now, living with my toxic family and losing relatives to covid is taking a huge toll on my mental health.  i've told my partner multiple times that i'm extremely depressed and want to die and he just ignores it everytime.  i don't know what to do, i've no one to talk about it, my mom literally is always disgusted by me and she makes sure i know it 4times a day.  i have friends but none with whom i can talk about this.  i don't know what to do anymore.  my partner is extremely rude and disrespectful towards my mental health.  he never went to any session with me even after i asked him multiple times.  he doesn't even pay attention when i'm trying to explain the medical terms or my condition.  i used to believe he loves me but i'm not sure anymore.  edit: i'm so thankful for everyone who have commented on this post.  reading all of this really helped me and  <e1> i'm really sorry that i am replying to the comments and messages </e1>  as  <e2> it is a little overwhelming for me right now </e2> . 
he gets paid weekly and gets paid amazingly well	every time we go out im like yes this is fun unless i have to pay for something	i dont know what to do.  ive been trying and trying to perk up.  we just moved to a new city.  like an actual city.  i should be happy.  but im not.  im constantly calculating my money over and over again.  it doesnt help that i had to quit one job and then start another to move down here.  so my last pay (if they got my timesheet to work), is only going to be $ 200.  and then six days later probably the same amount from my training from this current job.  btw, i absolutely hate this current job and im trying to get out of it.  my boyfriend doesnt seem to get it:  <e1> he gets paid weekly and gets paid amazingly well </e1> .  meanwhile i have ~3. 8k until payday.  so  <e2> every time we go out im like yes this is fun unless i have to pay for something </e2> .  and i hate it.  im really trying to see the good in this move, but its hard whenever youre really anxious abt money.  i have like, 1. 4-1. 6k/month in bills and my boyfriend was like how?.  im just.  hes supportive but he literarily told me: im tired of you being miserable.  i take viibryd.  i have a therapist.  im just.  i dont know.  i need more help. 
im	.	im 22 yo, been majorly depressed with 3-8 month long major depressive episodes a couple times a year, since i was 13.  ive been in therapy the entire time and taken tons of antidepressants and anxiety meds. im asking if anyone has any more medications, treatments, that i might be able to do to help?? ive been hospitalized, havent been able to work for almost a year.  i dont want to lose my house.  ive been on venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, pristiq, escitalopram, hydroxyzine, clonazepam, gabapentin, buspar, i dont even remember them all. .

sharing here	i want to feel seen or understood	everyone controls me.  it's not their fault.  it's mine.  from day 1 i did what i was told.  i was born that way.  born not wanting to be a burden.  born to make others happy before myself.  i am seriously messed up and i just want to be happy with myself.  i feel like crap and like my thoughts aren't worth other people's time.   <e1> sharing here </e1>  because  <e2> i want to feel seen or understood </e2> .  that's it.

hello,does	advance.	hello,does anyone have any tips on starting online therapy whilst living with their family?i think i need help but most local therapists are still offering services online (understandably).  our house has pretty thin walls, and i'm nervous about my parents hearing what i'm saying. i've read common suggestions online, and unfortunately, i don't have a car to sit in, i can't 'take a walk' and do the session (i need stable internet access), and i don't have a closet/wardrobe big enough to sit in! i also am not comfortable telling them about the session and asking them to go on a walk/wear headphones, etc. thanks in advance. 
i just wanted to get this it out there	maybe someone can read it and feel less alone in this world, take care everybody, sending much love to you all	ive just come home from a pretty decent, much needed party where i had a good time, but ever since i got home by myself i cant shake the old, bad feelings off. .  it just feels like they assaulted me all at once and its a lot to deal with.  what makes me sad is that they somehow always come back to me even during a decent time of my life, also this feeling of being alone. .   <e1> i just wanted to get this it out there </e1>  so that  <e2> maybe someone can read it and feel less alone in this world, take care everybody, sending much love to you all </e2> . 
i hate going on my newsfeed to see people sharing photos of them out drinking and having a good time	it just seems so fake	i was at a shopping centre earlier observing people and it made me feel disconnected from reality.  everyone seemed so stressed and just focused on materialism or looking at their mobile phones like programmed robots.   <e1> i hate going on my newsfeed to see people sharing photos of them out drinking and having a good time </e1>  because  <e2> it just seems so fake </e2> , if you are having a good time why do you need to share it? i dont feel like i can relate to anyone, my friends act the same they just want to go out drinking, take selfies and repeat until next weekend.  everyone just seems so soulless like there is no purpose anymore.  i feel so isolated surrounded by lifeless people that only seem to think and talk about themselves. 
i	trying.	i know there's plenty of people on here that don't make an account, but i want everyone who goes through the day fighting down these horrible feelings to know that you're not alone.  too many of us are suffering and i'm so sorry you are too.  getting through the rough week of work, and then hiding from the world for a couple days.  stay safe everyone.  please keep trying. 
i'm there for everyone else i text them right after a get the notification	i wish i wasn't lonely	i'm depressed just want someone to talk to, to be there like  <e1> i'm there for everyone else i text them right after a get the notification </e1>  then i'm alone again  <e2> i wish i wasn't lonely </e2>  i had someone idk what to do
it just makes me sad	i will never experience that	it is saturday night and i am laying in bed with the lights off.  i can hear people outside having a good time and  <e1> it just makes me sad </e1>  that  <e2> i will never experience that </e2> .  i dont know why im still here when i dont do anything except complain about how much life sucks.

i know what depression is	i have suffered it from ages 12-22	 <e1> i know what depression is </e1>  since  <e2> i have suffered it from ages 12-22 </e2>  but i havent really found myself depressed since then.  just bored.  just alone.  i live with my boyfriend and he has his own hobbies but i havent had one for about 7 years now.  should people like me just like, give up? im 27, i can do anything i want and i do nothing.  kinda seems like a waste of life. 
i	?	i can't take the mental exhaustion low self esteem is giving me much longer ?
i	answering?	i have a friend who suspects i might be depressed, but doesn't really know.  all i gave away was that i'm having trouble studying. then he started giving me advice, likely from his own experience (i suspect he may have been depressed too), that i did not really need - stuff like living healthy, having a good social life, doing what you like is what makes a change.  i told him thanks for your long answer, i agree, then changed the subject.  but he went ahead and dived right back in, saying essentially the same thing. i appreciate that he cared enough to write an elaborate answer, but i don't appreciate being lectured on things i already know.  not to mention he didn't really hear me say i agree.  he doesn't mean it, but he's being condescending, and i want him to stop.  but i do not want to confirm that i'm fucked up. how do i go about answering?
when they receive the postcards, they would take a selfie with a big smile	it makes us both very happy	hi all, i just wanted to quickly remind us that a small act of kindness will make you feel better.  i've just sent a few messages to friends that i haven't been talking to in awhile. and few weeks ago, i sent out a few postcards to some other close friends.   <e1> when they receive the postcards, they would take a selfie with a big smile </e1>  and  <e2> it makes us both very happy </e2> . it's hard now in the pandemic where people are wearing masks and avoid talking to each other but friendly chats with the cashiers or people on public transportation are good when it's possible to do.  for now, smiley eye contacts are enough i guess. have a good day. 
i feel like no one really understands what i'm going through	it does make me feel alone	i honestly feel fine some days and then some days i'm so debilitated.  i just want to talk to someone about this but  <e1> i feel like no one really understands what i'm going through </e1> .  they kinda think it's more like sadness but it's actually super intense.  which is fine but  <e2> it does make me feel alone </e2> .  my mind is so dark inside.  i go to therapy but there's still a part of me that doesn't wanna be alive.  like i can't experience the full extent of happiness.  i'd say 60% of my laughs and smiles are fake.  i'm on antidepressants for a year now.  i do things out of my comfort zone.  i try everything i possibly can.  but i still feel stagnant.  i guess i'm looking for support? good vibes? i just feel like i'm endlessly spiraling down this side of depression that i can't fully escape.  i've thought about ways to end the pain before reality pulls me back and says that's not a good idea. 
i'm	her.	i'm disgusting, i want to cut my arm's for pleasure.  i haven't got around to doing it yet.  i want to see blood drip down my arm.  i have done it with my thigh while masterbating, and it made me realize what a disgusting piece of shit i am.  what's wrong with me? if i tell my therapist it will just be really uncomfortable for her. 
I can't stand it some times	(she) doesn't have that same need for stimulus that I have	I am 25 years old, had ADHD since I was a kid but just got diagnosed.  Once I acknowledged I had ADHD I began to realize that certain behaviors really impacted my relationship.  I am dating a really sweet girl, but she is so calm and a home-body type  etc  <e1> I can't stand it some times </e1>  .  She is wonderful, but  <e2> (she) doesn't have that same need for stimulus that I have </e2>  .  As I look back, most of the things we disagree about (or very rarely fight about) stem from this in some way.  Has anyone else with ADHD experienced this, and do you have advice on working through it? Any thoughts on perhaps needing to be with someone with a more energetic nature? 
(I want to )embrace and accept all aspects of social anxiety	walking awkward on purpose, standing in a weird way, stuttering on purpose, blushing on purpose	The only thing I've ever done in my life to successfully overcome it is to  <e1> (I want to )embrace and accept all aspects of social anxiety </e1>  .  What i mean by that is  <e2> walking awkward on purpose, standing in a weird way, stuttering on purpose, blushing on purpose </e2>  , etc! If your doing the things you feel awkward about on purpose, when you actually want to feel that way, how is SA going to debilitate you? Think about it! It's working for me and my SA was extremely severe. 
I told the doctor that I didn't need it anymore	it was ruining my personality	I don't have ADHD, however for almost 13 years of my life I was told I did and that I was strange and would never succeed without ritalin and other medications.  I was diagnosed in the 1st grade (yes. ) and took the medicine until I was about 16.   <e1> I told the doctor that I didn't need it anymore </e1>  and  <e2> it was ruining my personality </e2>  and he said I would basically send my life down the drain if I stopped.  The medicine removed my personality and made me cold and cynical and still greatly impacts me who I am today.  Only a week after stopping the medicine I felt as if I had been living as a different person my whole life and felt brand new.  I feel alone in this situation and have always wondered if anyone else feels this way with medication on and off. 
Up until the last several months, I wouldn't consider missing a day whether I was working or not	I would produce music in my spare time, and found the Vyvanse especially useful for this	TLDR: When I take my medication on a day off, and have nothing to do, I drive myself up the walls.   If you have nothing to do, and no particular need to focus, do you skip your medication for that day? I have been taking 70mg Vyvanse for about 2 years now, and I couldn't be happier with the results.    <e1> Up until the last several months, I wouldn't consider missing a day whether I was working or not </e1>  , mostly because  <e2> I would produce music in my spare time, and found the Vyvanse especially useful for this </e2>  .   There was one point where I could produce at least one new song every day if I wanted to.  As of late, I haven't had the motivation or drive to create.   Whenever I would attempt to sit down and start composing, I would immediately trash my work and give up.  That being said, if there's nothing I need to intensely focus on, is there any why I couldn't just skip for the day?
Hello	want?Thanks.	Hello r/ADHD. . .  New to this subreddit and I have a few questions.  1.  Does anyone have any suggestions for dealing with ADHD while working? 2.  Does anyone have any advice on dealing with ADHD in college? 3.  Has your ADHD prevented you from a certain job that you want?Thanks.  
I	works.	I was diagnosed by a psychologist (at my wife's recommendation) in late November at 27, and finally found a psychiatrist that will see me after around 40 phone calls.  Now that I am officially going through my Sophomore year of college with a low GPA, I know medication isn't end all be all but if it ends up being prescribed hopefully it works. 
I have had GAD and some social anxiety for almost three years	All through elementary, middle school, and high school I had a terrible time with people who were supposed to be my friend but screwed me over	(18 f)  <e1> I have had GAD and some social anxiety for almost three years </e1>  .   <e2> All through elementary, middle school, and high school I had a terrible time with people who were supposed to be my friend but screwed me over </e2>  .  My sophomore year of high school I met a guy and we dated for two and a half years.  Half way through my first semester of college he left me out of no where.  He blamed my anxiety and said couldn't deal with it anymore, a clean start would be better for us both.  I had a complete break down and even ended up in the ER one night from a panic attack that lasted over an hour.  After a couple of months of hard work I started feeling better about myself. 
I've taken a stand against my anger	I had an incident that cost me a roommate and a expensive piece of my car	This is a venting post nothing more so not asking you to read my novel of a post.  I've wrote down everyday this past week to not get angry just relax and calmly address the situation.   <e1> I've taken a stand against my anger </e1>  ever since  <e2> I had an incident that cost me a roommate and a expensive piece of my car </e2> .  I've tried to fight the urge to get angry.  I've been keeping it to a low roar lately I almost lost it yesterday after seeing my ex with another guy and then getting stuck in traffic with something roiling around in the back making a smacking sound with every slight acceleration and deceleration.  almost lost it then but the worst I did was turn aggressively off the road and secure the thing that was bouncing around and then remained calm until I could get home.  But today my keys I wanted to go out to see a friend I need my cellphone wallet keys.  wait where are my keys? in my mind I'm thinking oh god. 
My	himself.	My anxiety's been getting worse, but on Sunday I started sertraline (Zoloft) and my anxiety's skyrocketed.   I have trouble sleeping.   This morning I woke up at 3:40am and couldn't get back to sleep.   I've tried everything from music to meditation to calm myself and nothing works.   I feel like I need to check myself into some kind of rehab center because I'm such a mess.   This morning I've been trembling and don't know how I'll survive a full day of meetings with this anxiety.   I can't imagine I'll eat well today.   I'm a complete mess.  It doesn't help that my brother with Asperger's this morning said he wants to kill himself. 
When I don't drink I have cravings to	I have to hide it and always feel guilty about it	(sorry for confusing title) the TL;DR of this is that I want to stop the compulsive addicting side of alcohol, but don't want to give it up socially.  So I drink a lot.  Not as much as some, but that's sort of irrelevant (but my  problem isn't that bad).  I don't drink every night (although I'd like to).   <e1> When I don't drink I have cravings to </e1>  .   <e2> I have to hide it and always feel guilty about it </e2>  .  I want to stop but it's difficult (I've tried before cold turkey and can sometimes last a short while but often fail).  The main thing is
I'm really pushing this semester to get one(A)	I usually go to the library start studying for around 2-3 hours	I have never gotten an A and  <e1> I'm really pushing this semester to get one(A) </e1> .  I will tell you what I usually do and maybe one of you guys can be my saviour who will help me get that A.   <e2> I usually go to the library start studying for around 2-3 hours </e2>  and I immediately get bored even while on my meds.  I used to be able to fix that with switching back and forth between an easier subject etc. .  But I've reached a point in my degree where all my courses are super hard.  My specific questions: How often should I take breaks while I'm studying so I don't get bored and also how do I do it without distracting/interrupting the flow of the task at hand? If you have a tried and true method can you please share it with me?  Thank you all lovely people and I hope your days are full of joy and happiness :) Edit: I know I can google this and get an answer but I just wanted to see what works best for a person with ADHD and see everyone else's experiences. 
My doctor will only address the depression anxiety and says any drugs that help ADD will make the anxiety worse so no	(my doctocr)he's not giving me any	I am clinically depressed, but have been for so long that it doesn't feel like the biggest issue, or at least it seems like a lot of what I'm depressed about it caused by my many failings at life, mostly due to ADD.  I also recently started having ridiculous and intense anxiety attacks.  I've always had a certain degree of anxiety.   <e1> My doctor will only address the depression anxiety and says any drugs that help ADD will make the anxiety worse so no </e1> ,  <e2> (my doctocr)he's not giving me any </e2> .  There must be someone else on here who takes a combination of drugs for all this that has some suggestions for me? I don't want to spend the rest of my life backspinning.  Edit: At first he mentioned welbutrin, but then decided against it because of it's potential to exacerbate the anxiety.  Ultimately he prescribed 30 mg Cymbalta for 2 weeks and then move up to 60 mg, and gave an emergency outlet of Ativan. 
I've started seeing a shrink and going to AA meetings that I hate	the spiritual side of it	I recently had a follow up from a CAT team about a suicide event that is likely partially because of my alcoholism (about 6-7 years of heavy drinking).   <e1> I've started seeing a shrink and going to AA meetings that I hate </e1>  (only because of  <e2> the spiritual side of it </e2> ).  I planned to go cold turkey today.  I asked the doctor if I can have some Valium so I don't risk the DTs (I get the shakes and from about 10am).  My referral to the detox facility isn't till the 11th (they are quite backed up).  I was already shaking and feeling like I was going to simultaneously vomit and have a heart attack.  Understandably you don't give addicts Benzos.  I asked if i should go cold turkey and she said the most joyous words i have heard in months.  I really wouldn't recommend that until you see the inpatient unit I felt so happy I could have cried.  Then the gravity of the situation hit me.  Just letting it off my chest. 
My father used to abuse my mother	Everything he is, I resent	I have an anger issue, but not like most.  I don't even know if I can call it that.  A little background.   <e1> My father used to abuse my mother </e1> , I was too young to remember, but was informed of this when my father kicked his girl friend out.  And he has a violent past.  And I have always wanted to be nothing like him.   <e2> Everything he is, I resent </e2> .  My mother tells me that's something your father would have said done and I get genuinely concerned.  But anyway.  I have this issue where it is nearly impossible to upset me.  I am a ameture boxer. 
I will listen to a song that I like CONTINUOUSLY until I have every lyric, beat, intro, and solo, down to the exact second it comes on	I get tired of a lot of music extremely quickly	I'm just curious if anyone out there does the same thing with music that I do.  Since I've been able to choice what music I listen to, I've found that  <e1> I will listen to a song that I like CONTINUOUSLY until I have every lyric, beat, intro, and solo, down to the exact second it comes on </e1> .  And because of this  <e2> I get tired of a lot of music extremely quickly </e2>  and am constantly finding myself finding a band or song that I love.  Only to be tired of them within a month.  For instance, my buddy showed me Thrift Shop by Macklemore a few weeks back.  Now I know the entire song by heart. 
I then got up and walked away	I felt I was being a little over dramatic and needed to cool down	It's not a common occurrence, but just now I got really angry at a video game and I hit myself twice in the leg and slammed my fist down on the couch.  I don't know why I chose to do that, it just felt logical.   <e1> I then got up and walked away </e1>  because  <e2> I felt I was being a little over dramatic and needed to cool down </e2> .  Out of nowhere I took the first thing I saw, which was a chair, and I knocked it over.  Then I punched the couch again.  Then I hit the wall.  Then I kicked the wall.  Then I slammed my hands on the top of the stairs as I stormed up them, and I thought What the fuck am I even doing? I wasn't even all that angry.  I had turned off my xbox and everything was fine. 
My	back.	My boyfriend is going through serious withdrawal from a week long binge and will not by any means go to a hospital to detox.  He is determined to taper off of alcohol with alcohol.  Any advice? I'm just afraid his intentions are to get 10 steps ahead but I have a feeling this is only going to take him 10 steps back. 
I wasn't conveying the information properly and no matter how I changed how I explained it they still didn't get it	(I'm)trying to break down the wall with my head	I just finished up with some googling looking into reasons for this in children and adults.  It seems like they all address it from an anger seeking attention view point.  I always did this when frustrated, the best example I can think of is in 3rd grade slamming my head against a wall a few times after being asked to help younger students learn math.  I became extremely frustrated that they weren't getting it.  Not that they couldn't understand it, but I felt that  <e1> I wasn't conveying the information properly and no matter how I changed how I explained it they still didn't get it </e1> .  Which led me to  <e2> (I'm)trying to break down the wall with my head </e2> .  I never had anger issues. 
DisclaimerThis	choice).	DisclaimerThis post is not meant for financial gain or blatant self-promotion.  I'm genuinely curious if this helps fellow disordered as well and if/where there's room for improvement.  It's hosted on Bandcamp for easy access and the opportunity to download it.

I put all of my needed items (keys, wallet, bus fare) in my hat every evening	I don't lose them, forget them, or have to look for them in the morning	I was trying to describe to my wife how my ADHD mind works, on and off of my meds.  She sees the external queues but I was trying to give her insight as to the inner workings as to why I do certain things like:  <e1> I put all of my needed items (keys, wallet, bus fare) in my hat every evening </e1>  so  <e2> I don't lose them, forget them, or have to look for them in the morning </e2> .  I'll skip my own metaphors for now and ask you to describe the inner workings of your beautiful mind!
they can't say horrible things	they're my friends	There's loads of screaming and shouting and it's making me feel really uncomfortable. . They're running up and down the stairs, past my door laughing and it's making me overthink - I know they have no issue with me and that things are fine but there's just this voice in my head telling me they're pitying me and laughing at me. The load noises, voices, music, everything is making me panic.  I feel trapped, like I can't escape, I can't leave the room, they'll just stare at me and say horrible things. . . but  <e1> they can't say horrible things </e1>  because I know  <e2> they're my friends </e2> . . . but I feel like they think horrible things, or I'm sure they do I'm just paranoid and worrying and I try to avoid these thoughts but the louder the noises get the more worrying my head gets and I don't feel comfortable, I need to escape. 
I	experience?	I feel like I am never really bored.  I have so many different things I want to do all the time and I never really have a down minute do be bored and worry about what I want to do.  Does anyone else have a similar experience? 
Hi,	me?	Hi, I'm very new to this subreddit.  I'm an 18 year old female.  I've been officially diagnosed with anxiety for a year now, but since I've grown teeth I've been biting my nails.  I bite them until they bleed just to calm me down.  I'm not too sure what exactly triggers it, just whenever I feel anxious, if that makes sense.  I've tried to just stop biting them, but I always relapse.  I've tried some medication for anxiety and depression (Zoloft, Celexa, Lamictal) but it barely helps.  I'm going untreated for my anxiety until I can find another psychiatrist, (my insurance changed and who I was seeing doesn't take my new insurance) but I want to know if there's anything I can do to stop.  I feel so embarrassed to have nails like this.   ( com/a/ycmlj) I've tried putting hot sauce on my fingers, painting them, finding something else to chew on, but nothing seems to work.  Can someone please help me?
I was mad	ADHD/ADD has become the answer and reason that has prevented me from reaching my full potential	I understand, this might probably be the last thing you want to hear.  Sometimes this thought might come across your mind when you're struggling with work or when you are thinking about yourself as person; using ADHD/ADD to define yourself, your thoughts, your actions, and everything about you.  I do it too.  But recently, I got really tired of it.  I wasn't mad at myself, I wasn't mad at my teachers and the people around me, I wasn't even mad at my ADHD/ADD.   <e1> I was mad </e1>  at the fact that  <e2> ADHD/ADD has become the answer and reason that has prevented me from reaching my full potential </e2> .  Yeah, having accommodations at school help, having understanding teachers and family is great, but it seems like I'm the only one who doesn't want to say, You know what? Fuck this ADD.  Why does it have to put me on another platform without anywhere to go.  Why does it have to be some sort of characteristic that I am bound by. 
much pleading from me, his parents, and his therapist	he went to an AA meeting	A person close to me has a drinking problem, and with  <e1> much pleading from me, his parents, and his therapist </e1>   <e2> he went to an AA meeting </e2> .  He told me that it was based too much on religion and everyone there had hit a 'rock bottom'.  This meaning that they all had either gone to jail, gotten several, DUIs, hit and run, etc.  etc.  He had nothing as extreme happen to him.  He's actually doing a lot better now from what I can tell and is really working on getting his life together.  I am just worried that he will fall back into a slump.  I want to know what programs besides AA have worked for you? &gt; I am pretty sure this might be the wrong subreddit, but am hoping someone can help me?
I	something.	I found this sub today.  I wish I knew about it long ago though.  It hurts me that other people have to live like I do, but I'm glad there's somewhere we can go where everyone understands.  Where people won't say, why don't you just be happy? I KNOW I should be happy.  I KNOW that I'm worth something. 
I found it(drinking) was detrimental to my overall well being	I've stopped without any outside help and without much trouble	I haven't had anything to drink for about a month now, but I used to drink a lot most evenings.   <e1> I found it(drinking) was detrimental to my overall well being </e1>  and  <e2> I've stopped without any outside help and without much trouble </e2> .  Part of me getting better was to go back to the doctor and get help for my ADHD.  He prescibed me Vyvance and I find that it is much more helpful than other medication I've tried so far, although it's only been a week.  I want to tell my doctor about the drinking in the past, but I'm worried he will think that I would abuse Vyvance and we'll go back to playing the try a million medications until another one works game.  I know. 
Has	body.	Has it happened to you when anxious (longer period) to feel every sensation on your body stronger as if the sensation was zoomed in? Like, when in normal situation an itching feels as itching, when anxious it feels as burning, is this normal? Also, some (not very much) painful bowel movements. . .  it seems as if I feel EVERYTHING that is going on in/on my body. 
Just	feedback?	Just curious if anyone here partakes in drinking alcohol a couple times a week while on adderall xr.  I'm currently on 20mg of it and I take it between 7am and 10am.  I'm just curious about any issues.  I generally wait about 12 hours before drinking and the soonest would be 10 hours.  I mostly notice it's the next day that I feel off.  Anyone got any feedback?
I'm doing too poorly in school	for 'study drugs' I simply want, instead of medication I maybe need	I'm going to try to scheduled an appointment somewhere tomorrow to explore this possibility.   However I can't decide between the cheaper, more convenient school system or going private HC for that reason.   The thing is I'm decently convinced I have this, it explains so much my life, except if I do have ADD/ADHD I need it addressed NOW.    <e1> I'm doing too poorly in school </e1>  to afford waiting even a week.   So basically I'm afraid I might be perceived by the school HC as trying to game the system  <e2> for 'study drugs' I simply want, instead of medication I maybe need </e2> . 
he's constantly manic the past couple months, and has been having severe grandiose delusions	He's been prescribed and been on for then past 2 weeks Olanzapine 5mg a night	If you've read my previous posts, you'd know my boyfriends condition is very recent.  He suffered from depression for 2 years and then  <e1> he's constantly manic the past couple months, and has been having severe grandiose delusions </e1> .   <e2> He's been prescribed and been on for then past 2 weeks Olanzapine 5mg a night </e2> .  Just curious as to your opinion on the drugs, if you had problems, if it worked, how long it took to start working, etc. .  
Through the day I go through periods of ups, downs, anger, hyperactivity, lethargy	It's such a pain and really frustrating	I'm having such a hard time trying to find the best combination of dosage, timing, instant release or sustained.  I've been on medication for around 3-4 weeks now and I keep switching between methylphenidate and Vyvanse, sometimes combining the two (with the advice of my doctor), and not taking meds at all.  My side effects are not severe, but they're still really bothersome.  I get emotional, irritable, angry quickly, and I'm afraid that it will bother my sleep (I've stayed up all night twice in one week when I was new to my meds). Plus, how much food and sleep I get the day before or in the morning affects the effectiveness and side effects of my medication.

Aderall	nervous.	Aderall XR 20mg I'm nervous. 
I	boss.	I am an ADHD'er who when I get overwhelmed just end up shutting down and turn into a tearful mess.  I know it happens, and I can usually tell BEFORE it happens and try and alter the situation so I can calm down. I had gotten a '12 Honda Civic in October of last year, decided it just was not right, and switched to a '10 Honda Insight today. My husband was with me and was the one who was listening to the finance stuff and sorting that all out.  I at one point started to just get so over stimulated by  the amount of questions I had to ask to leave the room.  I did, went out and walked around the lot a bit before coming back.  I was able to finish what i needed and I succeeded in getting my (new to me) car today. TL;DR - Spent 5 hours at a car dealership with big words being thrown at me.  Didnt cry, feeling like a boss. 
Activity can be low sometimes	people may look at other things while still be connected to the chat	Hi everyone, we want to welcome more new people to our chat   freenode. net/?channels=/r/ADHD  It has a very casual atmosphere, topics tend to be all over the place.   Things to be aware of:   <e1> Activity can be low sometimes </e1> , since  <e2> people may look at other things while still be connected to the chat </e2> .   Being an arsehole is not tolerated.   Don't send private messages to other people without asking first (It can be considered rude)  Otherwise drop by and say hi.  :) 
Since	person.	Since I got to college I've been meeting with a counselor.  We determined my shyness and nervousness around people is a little bit of Social Anxiety.   I'm not to the point where I can't talk to people, but sometimes it effects me.  It more annoys me than anything that I don't do what I want cause I get too nervous about it.   How did you make the anxiousness go away? Like I said, I'm functional, but would like to learn to be a more outgoing, friendly, carefree person. 
about 2 weeks I stopped drinking	I got to a point where the beer wasn't knocking me out and I was out of money and the only way to get drunk was to drink spirits which I knew I'd be dead in a few years if I started to do	For about 3 years now I've been drinking to black out drunkness every other night and then binge drinking the entire weekend friday through til sunday night and  <e1> about 2 weeks I stopped drinking </e1>  because  <e2> I got to a point where the beer wasn't knocking me out and I was out of money and the only way to get drunk was to drink spirits which I knew I'd be dead in a few years if I started to do </e2> .  I've been sober now for 12 days and my mood has been a constant 4/10 the entire time and I'm just feeling bored and like I want to drink all the time.  Is this depression going to go away at any point or am I just stuck like this forever? I hope someone can help me.  Thanks for reading. 
This	me.	This was in my anniversary card she gave me on 3. 15:  How could I NOT love you? you are the absolute best boyfriend ever.  I am so lucky to be with you.  There was a lot of drama on my end this year, but you kept me calm and I appreciate it.  Youve made this past year amazing.  I love you so much.   Then she goes into a deep depression, now its the point shes manic and telling me not to ever talk to her again, and to delete her number.   What can I do? She wont let me talk to her.  At all.   I want to get on the phone and force her to listen to me. 
So	focusing.	So it's been like a month since I've worked out and I've always done it at night.  But today I did it a couple of hours after taking my vyvanse.  I was at the phase where you can start to feel the medication pump through you.  After working out for only an hour I feel drained completely and almost sick in my stomach.  Anyone have this issue? I'm assuming it's normal when you get it if shape but the way I feel is odd.  Like when you fill a balloon with air and pop it.  Just incredibly drained.  And I never felt good or amped during the workout.   I've noticed a similar thing with stressful moments.  The stress gets overwhelming and seems to override how the medication was making me feel or any attempts at focusing. 
i do too much reading	while i see some similarities i see more non	Hey fellow redditors.  Long time lurker, first time poster here.  Recently (abt 4 months ago) i was re-diagnosed as BipolarNOS (first time was about 8 yrs ago).  Issue is i am not convinced that i am Bipolar.  My Psychiatrists says if i do have it i have a very soft form of hypomania (depression is very evident).  I'm not as convinced.  Perhaps it's because  <e1> i do too much reading </e1>  and well  <e2> while i see some similarities i see more non </e2> .    Most of my manic times are usually panic/anxiety filled experiences where i can get somewhat hyper. 
I'm 17 and am uncomfortable discussing this stuff in front of my parents who accompany me on every doctor's visit	I'd really appreciate it if someone could direct towards something that doesn't have the side effects adderall does	I've tried to get on adderall multiple times, and it works for short periods of time.  If I take it one day I feel good all day and ok the next day.  The exception being, it is much harder to get erections, my right testicle hurts, and when I ejaculate my left testicle wants to retract inside my body.   Where if I take it for a few days, its effects are less and less noticeable, I'm depressed when I come off of it, my rosacea gets worse, and my lips are really dry.  I'm also very irritable when I come down off it.     <e1> I'm 17 and am uncomfortable discussing this stuff in front of my parents who accompany me on every doctor's visit </e1> , so  <e2> I'd really appreciate it if someone could direct towards something that doesn't have the side effects adderall does </e2> , (especially the sexual side effects and mood swings) so I could suggest it and talk it over with my doctor. 
The	back.	The actual experience of turning myself inside out for the first time in the presence of an AA member left me drained and numb; but when feeling started to come back. 
Hey,	now.	Hey, r/ADHD.  I've been tested and diagnosed with ADHD and have been lurking for a while on this subreddit.  You guys are awesome!  Anyway, one of the problems I have is not being able to stop thinking of things.  Not just thoughts running through my head constantly but unpleasant thoughts that stick with me and no matter how hard I try to get rid of them they rarely go away.  They can be stuck in my head for hours and even days.  Sometimes I try so hard to stop thinking of certain things that I get seriously frustrated.    I was wondering if any of you guys deal with this and if you have advice.   Sorry if my grammar is bad, it's really late right now. 
I will be in NYC and my family isn't very wealthy	I'm concerned about the costs	I've only recently been speaking to a psychological counselor at my school and I told her the symptoms that I felt I've been struggling with since middle school.  I am currently a graduate student at 23 years old and am looking forward to finally getting a formal diagnosis from a professional during the upcoming summer.   <e1> I will be in NYC and my family isn't very wealthy </e1>  so  <e2> I'm concerned about the costs </e2> .  I would like to ask other Redditors who were diagnosed as adults, how long did the process take for you guys? Was it easy to make a diagnosis? Was it expensive? Are there other Redditors in NYC that would recommend a testing center? edit: It appears that 'ADHD-PI' is the proper term for what I'm trying to describe, not ADD.

I am not insured	I would like to arrive at the best solution as quickly as possible	Hey everyone.  I am 31 years old and after many years of suspecting I had adhd I went in and was diagnosed.  I was given 36mg concerta.  When I take it I find myself tired and more distracted then normal.  My question is whether this is a result of the wrong dosage or the wrong medication.  I already scheduled an appointment to discuss with my psychiatrist but would like to arm myself with other peoples experiences before I go in.   <e1> I am not insured </e1>  so  <e2> I would like to arrive at the best solution as quickly as possible </e2> .  Thanks for your help everyone.   Update.  Doc easily switched me to adderall xr.  Fingers crossed thanks for your time everyone.  
You	manic.	You know how when you're manic you think you can do anything? This scale measures the tendency to set implausibly high goals.   You can take it here  psy. miami. edu/faculty/ccarver/sclWASSUP. html  Your score should be higher (setting more unrealistic goals;if you get grandiose) when manic than when depressed or euthymic.  For example, when manic you would be more likely to believe that celebrities will want to be your friends.  Let's just use that one as an example.  If you do get grandiose when manic. 
bullet	stupid.	bullet points cus this is gonna be a lot of info diagnosed with ADHD-C two months ago (over spring break) my whole life makes sense to me now, I'm really excited about figuring myself out tell parents after I come back from doctor parents laugh, say I'm making excuses, You're not even that hyper.  You're too smart for that.  I feel stupid. 
(I)Got mad at myself	(I'm)getting sucked into my ADHD anti-sleep mind	Got in bed at 1am.  Decided to browse front page of reddit to help relax and transition to being ready to fall asleep (big mistake).  Learned how we've only mapped 10% of the ocean via a picture.    Shared the photo to a friend via text msg.  Speculated on the vast unknown.  Proposed the need to focus more on ocean exploration rather than space.  Got mad at NASA.   <e1> (I)Got mad at myself </e1>  for  <e2> (I'm)getting sucked into my ADHD anti-sleep mind </e2> .  Realized that a picture really is worth a thousand words, or at least a few hours.    Anyways, this is a very abbreviated example of my mind tonight.  I know others with ADHD and/or anxiety have this problem when trying to fall asleep.  How is it for you? Is it random thoughts, organized, meaningful, pointless, recurring, etc, all of the above?

We've discussed the generic component of bipolar disorder, especially since we believe my mother has undiagnosed bipolar disorder	We are worried about the chance that I will pass this on to our children	My husband and I have discussed this many times.  I just turned 31 and we had planned to try for two children starting this year.  My diagnosis last year has delayed those plans and cast a pall on the new plan, which is to try for children in a year when I will likely be stable on my meds.   I've discussed it with my doctor and he outlined the risks.  We also talked about the impact on me and the stoppages and changes in medication that I would need to make.  He also said I wouldn't be able to breastfeed for as long as I'd like due to the need to get back on meds (apparently, post  partum depression is common for us females).    <e1> We've discussed the generic component of bipolar disorder, especially since we believe my mother has undiagnosed bipolar disorder </e1> .   <e2> We are worried about the chance that I will pass this on to our children </e2> .

My wife does not believe it(ADHD)	I haven't been diagnosed	I once was diagnosed ADHD when I was younger.  I was on 40mg xr in the am and 20mg ir in the afternoon.  From age 7/8 to about 17. . .  I took myself off.  After being convinced my mom was only using it as a paycheck ( disability) after many years in starting to understand ADHD and am curious as if I should get re established. . .   <e1> My wife does not believe it(ADHD) </e1>  because  <e2> I haven't been diagnosed </e2> , however I find many reasons that are making me contemplate. . . .  But first things first any body have a nagging significant other that when they and the stress starts they shutdown and hyperfocus on cleaning or other busy work. . . . . . 
Like	areas?	Like many with ADHD, I struggle with avoidance and low self-esteem coupled with a high intelligence and ability to go into hyper-focus on the tasks that interest me.   Now that I am in grad school, the strategies that got me through college and high school (i. e.  use last minute panic to my advantage and a willingness to work until I collapse when needed) are not cutting it.   I realize that I need to quickly develop time management skills and learn to schedule tasks in a rational way so that breaks large projects down into smaller, manageable steps.     Scheduling, however, means having a sense of how long something is likely to take.   It also requires an ability to be aware of time as it passes to make sure I don't go into hyper-focus on an unimportant detail and lose the forest for a tree.   What strategies or technologies have you found helpful in these areas?
I	fall.	I got diagnosed with ADHD Freshman year around october, and started taking 30mg of adderall daily, with 5-10mg at night as needed.  My motivation was awesome, and I often studied for long amounts of time (I practically lived at the library).  The summer I stopped taking adderall, and once the year started I started to take 20mg + the 5 as needed.  That fall I, again, did great in school.  Then the spring semester started. . .   Motivation shot.  I will sometimes perk back up for a day or two, but I can never get myself to go to the library.  I went maybe two or three times last semester compared to the fall semester - I seriously could go everyday for 4+ hours.  I feel like I'm running out of some chem in my brain that helps me think critically without getting tired or something. . .  I almost would say it would give me a high when studying; I loved it.  Now critical thinking or whatever just makes me tired.  I'm not sure what to do.  I've gotten the high once since the fall.

He goes to AA meetings 2 times a week and was unemployed for a while.   <e1> (my dad)He recently got a new job </e1>  and because of that  <e2> my mom took a chance to go on vacation </e2> .  My older sister had been suspicious of my dad drinking the day after my mom left.  My sister texted me about an hour ago telling me that he has been drinking and I couldn't help but start crying.  How should I confront him about it? Sorry if I'm in the wrong subreddit but I am just looking for some serious advice on how to talk to him.  Thank you.  
I've	myself.	I've been having a lot of anger issues over the last 10 years, maybe more, of my life.   It is getting to the point where I'm afraid that I'm going to get into it with someone one day, and get hurt of worse.   I know my wife fears this too.   When I was growing up, I was always a quiet loaner type kid.   I never stood up for myself. 
My partner has a hard time understanding this	(my partner)has gotten frustrated	While I'm having a panic attack it's near impossible for me to bring myself out of it.  It's a very delicate process.   <e1> My partner has a hard time understanding this </e1>  and  <e2> (my partner)has gotten frustrated </e2>  by my panic attacks in the past.   Have you experienced this? How did you explain the impending doom of a panic attack to someone that just doesn't get it?
She's going down the wrong path, she's going to be another beautiful girl with low self esteem, I'm not there for her and I can't be	I fucked up	I either care too much  Or I don't care at all.   When I care too much I think the worst is happening.   <e1> She's going down the wrong path, she's going to be another beautiful girl with low self esteem, I'm not there for her and I can't be </e1> .  Because  <e2> I fucked up </e2>  and It's been eating me up ever since.   I can't help but have irrational thoughts that slowly spin out of control.  And eventually my stomach drops.    I don't know if I have anxiety but I've always imagined it feeling like this. 
Hi	screens.	Hi all,  I just wanted to document this.  Maybe it wasn't a complete failure but I can't keep screwing up like this.   I don't take medication.    I was so excited to be executing 2 30 second commercials all in 3D that will be airing all over the entire state.  Knowing I have ADHD, I came up with a great looking style that I knew would be simple to do and simple for even my ADHD self to finish.   The parts that were out of my control were the worst anxiety I've ever felt.  Every time we went to a meeting, my simple idea got turned complex.  Then even more complex.  Then even more complex.  When I spoke up, it was shut down.  When I said I really can't pay attention to the blue screens. 
I'm even starting to think anxiety triggers it(my stomach would make strange noises)	when I can get myself to calm down it goes away	I started noticing about a year ago that my stomach would make strange noises, and as I became more and more self conscious about it, whenever I'm in a quiet room I agonize over whether my stomach will make strange noises.   <e1> I'm even starting to think anxiety triggers it(my stomach would make strange noises) </e1> , because  <e2> when I can get myself to calm down it goes away </e2> .

I have been to short-term mental hospitals three times, and by the end I always feel optimistic about the future but it always eventually wanes into deep depression again	I think I need to go somewhere  longterm	I have had depression and severe anxiety for several years, which, long story short, lead to some drug problems.    <e1> I have been to short-term mental hospitals three times, and by the end I always feel optimistic about the future but it always eventually wanes into deep depression again </e1> .   So  <e2> I think I need to go somewhere  longterm </e2> .  My mother suggested it a while ago, but thought I'd just try to do it myself this time for some dumb reason.  Needless to say, it didn't work.  Still suicidal thoughts, and, today, an honest-to-god attempt (my friend came over by chance and heard the car running in the garage).   Basically my question is: Does anybody have any trustworthy recommendations for a place to go? Either from personal experience, or word of mouth, or any trustworthy source? Thank you, benign souls of Reddit.  
I've	exhausting.	I've been going to a guy for a couple of months, trying a few things at a few doses.  Two or three months ago he brought up the possibility of bi-polar, then later started me on Lamictal.  There's my back story.  I am fascinating.   So, here's my thing that I'm afraid to ask or look up on your webmd or what have you.  Do other people feel like they go through spates of being a mixed bag? Never knowing what's going to happen or how to feel from day to day?  Monday feel pretty good.  Go to bed, wake up Tuesday unable to do anything.  Nothing triggers, nothing different has happened, but switching up and down.   It gets super exhausting. 
I am feeling so hopeful	my therapist herself has ADHD and seems to be quite the advocate	I have been struggling with self-diagnosed (and largely ignored) ADHD for as long as I can remember, but recently my symptoms have really been giving me problems.    Today I met with a therapist who is confident in my self-diagnosis and wants me to get formally tested and diagnosed with ADHD.   <e1> I am feeling so hopeful </e1>  because  <e2> my therapist herself has ADHD and seems to be quite the advocate </e2> .  She said she wouldn't create my treatment plan until she fixed my intake assessment which did not (apparently despite my description to the intake councilor) include the ADHD and needed to.    She also seems to be cooperative with my desire to start with behavioral modification and forward-faced solutions rather than digging into my history and past right away.  I could spend 2 years in therapy about my past and not have any working solutions for my day-to-day dysfunction.  I want to start functioning!! I feel like this is a huge step and for the first time in so long I have hope for my ability to be the person I know is in here somewhere! 
Ive	sense.	Ive been on different antidepressants for 5 years.   Ive been taking effexor for the last year (225mg/day).   I feel like my cycles of good and bad times are becoming more rapid.   I dont know if its just stopping me from more anxiety and depression or if its just not working.   Im afraid of switching medication and it not working.  i hope this incoherent ramble makes some sense. 
You	mean?	You know how when you're walking down the street or in a mall or whatever, and you walk past a friendly person and they smile at you? I can never return the smile.  Then I just end up looking like a grouch.  I feel as if my attempt to smile will appear so foolish and fake, and that the person I am passing will just laugh at how idiotic I look.  Anybody else know what I mean?

I do have trouble concentrating in school or tasks	it's really starting to affect my grades and I daydream very often, forget something I was just told	Hey guys, I just want to know because  <e1> I do have trouble concentrating in school or tasks </e1>  and  <e2> it's really starting to affect my grades and I daydream very often, forget something I was just told </e2>  like 'Please take out the trash' while right next to it.  Sometimes I just get angry for the most trivial things like 'Oh, My shoes are cluttered? WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY CLUTTERED?' And just throw a tantrum.  I have been wanting to get tested but want to be sure I have good enough reason.  Thanks in advanced. 
My so is awesome and supportive, but can't quite understand what I go through (not for a lack of trying)	I can't tell you how awesome it is to have this also	Before being diagnosed today, you guys gave me the sense I wasn't alone in this and helped me get treatment.  Doc started with Wellbutrin after discussing everything with me and the different options available. . . anyone have any luck with it?   In any event, I'm glad I have this community.   <e1> My so is awesome and supportive, but can't quite understand what I go through (not for a lack of trying) </e1> , so  <e2> I can't tell you how awesome it is to have this also </e2> .  Keep on keeping on.  
Or,	medication.	Or, how can I convince my new psychiatrist that I'm not a junkie.    I've been on Adderall XR for several years and I've found that it works well for me.  I usually only take it when I'm working (I work 4 10-12 hour shifts a week, and even then I usually don't take it every day) or if I have some huge project that needs to get done.  I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school and I've tried Ritalin and some other prescription but I experienced unpleasant side effects.  With Adderall the only side effects I've had are loss of appetite and dry mouth.    Now I've moved to a different state and I have a new insurance company who referred me to a new psychiatrist.  I had a phone consultation with him, and he kept repeatedly saying that he wanted to explore non stimulant options with me.  I told him that I was happy with my current meds and that I didn't want to try a new medication. 
Pretty	else?	Pretty much worried its going to make me worse, sleepy, numb, out of control, depressed etc etc.  Just can't do it.  Anyone else? 
Bull.	criteria.	Bull.   When did low GPA become DSM-IV criteria for ADHD? Especially when one scores severe and very severe for all other criteria. 
I	suggestions?	I haven't been on a date in twenty years.  I don't know where to begin.  I'm becoming depressed over the idea.  Online dating scares me and I try not to go out much anymore.  Where does a forty year old begin to rebuild his life? I've been stable for a while now and don't want to lose it over this.  Any suggestions?
he increased my dosage to 60mg and asked of I wanted to try Vyvanse	he mentioned it was stronger	Hello all, Within the last two months I was diagnosed with Combined ADHD and began taking medicine.  I started with Adderall XR at 30mg and I felt all the wonderful help this medicine gives people who suffer from ADHD.  After a few weeks, that effect went away.  I told my doctor this and  <e1> he increased my dosage to 60mg and asked of I wanted to try Vyvanse </e1> .  I said yes, because  <e2> he mentioned it was stronger </e2> .  Unfortunately, I feel nothing from Vyvanse at 60mg.  I am just frustrated that I have to go higher in dosage.  From what I understood from my doctor, once you hit the right dosage it will click and the medicine will be effective.  But anything below that will be ineffective.  Has anyone else experienced this process of finding the right dose? Any advice on what to look for with myself or explain to my doctor when I go in again?
Hey	stimulants.	Hey Everyone, hope you're having a swell Tuesday.   I visited a psychiatrist last Wednesday and was prescribed Adderall XR 10mg for ADHD and Klonopin . 5mg for anxiety and panic disorder.   The Klonopin has worked very well as needed to calm my panic attacks, which is great.   The Adderall XR 10mg however hasn't had much effect.   The first day I felt a bit more motivated and it was easier to focus on things, but the effects are fleeting and aren't very consistent.   My question is, is it too soon to call and update my Psychiatrist about how the medication is affecting me? (~1 week).   The psychiatrist mentioned starting me on a lower dose to see how I respond to stimulants. 
I remember as a kid our parents used to complain that we should turn down our music	it gave them a headache	I was wondering if anyone is bothered by noise, or any noise in particular.   There are some noises that really set me on edge: barking/yapping dogs, kids, classical and jazz music.   Right now I have the asshole neighbor's dog barking on one side, and kids screaming while their parents blast jazz music on the other.  I think someone has it in for me today.  My neck is killing me.  I'm going to go hide soon so I don't scream at somebody.    <e1> I remember as a kid our parents used to complain that we should turn down our music </e1>  because  <e2> it gave them a headache </e2> . 
I	harder?	I have quite a few meds in the graveyard and a good chunk are antipsychotics.  I used to out right refuse them but I have pretty much run the course of mood stabalizers.  I am actually on lamictal and lithium right now.  My Dr. started me on fanapt today and now I am laying in bed wide awake with a pounding and fast heart rate.  I called the Dr and she thinks it is a panic attack.  I am really at a loss.  She said if this one tanked zyprexa was next.    I am really discouraged right now.  It seems like the older I get the harder it is to manage this shit.   I feel like poison to my loved ones.  I am having more and more trouble in the workplace.    Does it just keep getting harder?
Yelling	outside.	Yelling is kind of cathartic for me.  I can't afford therapy; would assaulting someone get me some free, court-mandated therapy or anger management?  He binges.  Then he's sober.  Repeat.  I feel empty inside.  Today was a sober day for him.  We have routinely been taking walks outside. 
I've	you.	I've been putting this off for too long and want to tackle this before 2014 is upon us.  I'm looking for the best, and am open to various disciplines (psychiatry, psychology, etc).  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.  Thank you.  
I	level.	I regularly see posts from young women asking what motherhood is like with ADHD.  I love my kids and I am so glad they exist.  That said, there are certain situations that I prefer to avoid when possible.   Yesterday I found myself in one of these.   The setting was a family friendly pool party with young children and drinking adults.  Most adults at the party did not have kids.   The pool was the dangerous kind - ground level. 
I	awesome!	I have been on methylphenidate for 18 years.  I was just (as in, an hour ago) switched to Vyvanse after talking to my new doc about issues I'm having when I have to work long shifts.  I have had problems with XR meds just not having much effect in the past (both XR Ritalin and Concerta), so he and I are both watching out for the same thing here.  For anyone else who's made this switch, what should I be on the lookout for? I guess I should say that on methylin, I had almost no side effects even at a mid-high level dose (25mg x 2 per day).  I'm supposed to try it for a month and see how it goes.  I chose this time because it's a relatively quiet time at my somewhat intense job, but I'm still concerned that it might be an issue.  I guess I'm just scared of change.   Ed: it's been about 90 minutes since I took my first dose.  This is awesome!
Hi.	years.	Hi.  I'm currently diagnosed with Bipolar 1 since 2010.  On Invega Sustena (paliperidone) and Epilim (sodium valporate) medication.  I would like to try out LSD for the first time and would like to hear your opinion on whether it is safe for a person like myself.  I'm currently stable and have not had manic or depressive episodes for the past 2 years. 
I've	months.	I've noticed neither ritalin or concerta have been working and I recently found out that me feeling this way for the past 6 months was me being depressed for the past 6 months.  
The	brain.	The caffeine raises my heartbeat, which leads to a small attack.  I also get anxious after a work out.  I think my brain has made an connection between a raised heartbeat and discomfort.  :( Scumbag brain.  
I	anger.	I am 14 year old twin boy with crohns disease.  I was supposed to start school in a week and my parents just told me that my family and I am going to a new school starting in TWO days.  I have two days to get all my NEW school stuff and tel all of my friends.  This might sound like a average oh no I'm moving complaint but its more.  I have crohns which is an annoying painful disease but what makes it worse is the medication.  The medication is a SEVERELY painful shot and I get anxiety about this shot.  I'm depressed because my life for the past two years has felt like one long ride to a bloodwork appointment.  If moving wasnt bad enough the new school I have to go to is a strict private school where instead of art and photo as electives I'm taking religion and computers.  Any way please leave comments on how to deal with depression and anger. 
Hey	are.	Hey everyone.     I take 40mg vyvanse every week day in the AM before heading out to work, and most days I stop at a convenience store and grab a drink, typically an Arnold Palmer from Arizona.  I was not really ever even thinking about the caffeine content of this drink (just looked it up, 43mg per can) until earlier today when I realized that over the past few weeks I have gotten a Gatorade instead a few times and thinking back I have been much more self-directed in my focus and attention on days I have consumed Gatorade instead of a drink with caffeine in it.    I was curious if anyone else here has ever noticed anything similar.   Thanks!  Edit:   I suppose I will expand the question and ask about other differences in morning routine that others may have noticed have an impact on the way their meds work for them and how their attention and general productivity throughout the day are.  
I came here and posted my story	I felt I had nowhere else to turn	I just wanted to thank this subreddit.    <e1> I came here and posted my story </e1>  because  <e2> I felt I had nowhere else to turn </e2> .    I got some good advise and went to AA that very same day.   I'm two weeks sober as of today and looking forward to a life of sobriety.    I wasn't sure AA would be the place for me but it's really an amazing program.   The people there welcomed me with open arms and really made me feel at home.   It really is a type of therapy talking to other alcoholics.   Every meeting I leave with a sense of hope after hearing peoples recovery stories.   I just went to a meeting last night with a fellow that I only met once and he invited me to a meeting.   As of yesterday he has eight years sobriety.   Truly remarkable.   If your reading this and feel like you've lost all hope and have nowhere else to go I would recommend giving AA a shot.   It's not for everyone but I found that it's the right place for me.   Thanks again guys and gals. 
TL;DR	forget	TL;DR 22 year old college dropout diagnosed with severe ADHD trying to be a real person in a situation not suited for someone with my brain.  Help?  This is the first time I have talked in detail about my problems with ADHD and the first time I've poured my heart out on the internet.  Usually I'm more of a keep-my-problems-to-myself type but here goes nothing:  I did okay in school.  Always a high C or low B average but everyone kept telling me that I'm so smart and should be doing better.  Middle school was when it first started to be a problem.  The phrase You forgot because you chose to forget
My	Yes.	My therapist keeps talking about things and thoughts that make me feel anxious.   And ways to deal with the things and the thoughts, so that I don't feel anxious.   She does not seem to understand that I don't need a THING or a THOUGHT to make me anxious.   I AM anxious!  I feel anxiety ALL the time, and there is not necessarily any immediate reason or remedy!  I don't think people understand that asking me to figure out why I'm anxious is like asking someone with Major Depressive Disorder why they're depressed.   Why?  Because there's something fucked up with my brain/body, and I can no more just relax using nothing but thought or coping skills than I could just cheer up using nothing but thought when I was depressed.   Yes. 
Being tired increases my anxiety/stress	I'm in nursing school and I need to be alert when I'm with patients	So, I'm actually doing pretty well right now.  I'm a little stressed and angry about some things at school, but I'm keeping myself calm and working through things.    My main problem the past 3 or 4 nights is Insomnia.  It takes me forever (1-2 hours) to fall asleep and then I wake up a few hours later.   <e1> Being tired increases my anxiety/stress </e1>  because  <e2> I'm in nursing school and I need to be alert when I'm with patients </e2> .    I've tried counting, I've tried warm showers, I've tried Tylenol PM and none of those things really work for me.    Does anyone have any ideas about other things I could try?
The hiring managers both said they really liked me	(the hiring managers)hired me on the spot	I'm amazed, really.   I have no clue how it happened.    <e1> The hiring managers both said they really liked me </e1>  and  <e2> (the hiring managers)hired me on the spot </e2> .   I was scrambling for words out of excitement.   I saw myself shaking throughout the whole thing while I felt myself sweating down to my waist. . .  literally.   My mouth was as dry as a desert, but I was able to get out words.   Crazy, I know.   It's all thanks to the help I get on here! 
I'm	me.	I'm currently located in a small, isolated town.  They have AA meetings 3 times per week.  I went faithfully for three weeks, but they kept talking about doing the work.  But the only people to go regularly were myself and two ex-cons on parole.  They were super sweet and really helpful to me. 
Right now I just want to lay down	I feel relatively weak	I started today for the first time.  I got 18mg of a methylphenidate generic drug and haven't really noticed any significant changes in my focus or memory, however I noticed I am feeling super nauseated sort of like a caffeine crash.    Is there anything I can eat/do to reduce this feeling?  <e1> Right now I just want to lay down </e1>  because  <e2> I feel relatively weak </e2> .    Also as a side note, I barely had lunch, which was expected.   
Thank	office.	Thank you all so much for responding! I am looking into Smart Recovery meetings that we will both attend.  Vodkaanddietsprite, I've already checked out the tapering site, and have showed this entire thread to BF.  He's going to continue his tapering, but I will be keeping close eye on him and hope that he sticks with it.  I knew cold turkey could be dangerous, but having heard it from someone who has been there really makes it hit home.  Plus, I realize that I posted on here, instead of googling it, because I was half hoping that I wouldn't get an answer, and could avoid it just a little longer.  It's scary shit.  So, to close, thank you all again, and if this path looks as though it will not work, we are hitting the doctor's office. 
This	stuff)	This morning I woke up and felt really crappy.   Sinus pressure, that constant tingling in the nose, warm, headache.   Just clearly coming down with a cold.   I popped my meds for the morning about twenty minutes before I have to leave for work, I sneeze, and of course it just kicks in.   Runny nose, droopy eyes, very warm body temperature.   Clearly just plain sick.   I decide to ask my boss to do a half day at work when I get there because I'm just feeling like crap.    By 9 A. M.  I'm right as rain, clear sinuses, just a bit of pressure, warm (I'm always warm on Adderall), and not drowsy and tired.   Come about two though, and I feel the head hurting underneath (the same feeling I get when I know I'm supposed to be hungry but have no appetite on this stuff)
I	begins.	I read this subreddit and I feel like I understand where a lot of you are coming from, and theres part of me that thinks i might actually have anxiety issues but then i feel like a lot of it is just normal being awkward and withdrawn and i can't tell where one end stops and the other begins. 
I	advice?	I get nervous when going into college, like my heart will race a little bit and it will start racing again if I ask a question out loud or my name is called on the roster.  I don't feel nervous throughout the whole day just in certain situations.  I also believe I have hypochondria as I constantly worry about medical issues.  Any advice? 
Great	present.	Great fun when it feels as if time is running through your fingers, and there is nothing you can do about it.  Try to focus on the present as much as possible, only to focus on something else mildly entertaining.   The last few days have been pretty hard in terms of my perception of time and what I am currently doing.  I have been full force going with the flow of things, dragging to one task to the next depending on what my mind catches as interesting. . .  and really I feel as if my short term memory has been kicked in the face.   I am hopping this burred mind feeling will go away soon, it isn't fun.  Anyone else feeling this as well recently? I am mostly ranting about my suffering and hoping to hear some voices that may help me reflect on the present. 
But	?	But I'm terrified of going on something else, and receiving horribad side effects.   I'm 25, and still having odd growth spurts (?!) and I'm really worried that suddenly the drug that used to keep me sane at work in a low dose is now not working. . .   What do I say to my psychiatrist. . . ?
I am non medicated	my family is super against it	Hi.  I am a 19 year old person with ADHD,  <e1> I am non medicated </e1>  because  <e2> my family is super against it </e2> , but im starting to get REALLY frustrated about me losing things, all the time.  The bank knows me by name because thats how often i lose my bank card.  I can't help that i lose everything, I just do.  What should i do????
Although	too.	Although there was no structure to to this podcast it was really fun to do.  I had a hard time convincing my friend to agree to upload it, he just wasn't pleased with the end result which i understand.  I however am sure that some of you out here will enjoy it.     com/user501455152/adhdvsas   Feel free to drop us comments and ask questions.   If you would like us to do another episode let us know feel free to droop us some suggestions too. 
I	ADHD?	I posted a few weeks back that I was concerned about doing too well on my ADHD tests.  I recently got my diagnosis and was told by the psychiatrist that I performed above average on most of the tests, with an IQ of 122, &amp; did 'average' on the memory tests.  I believe he said something along the lines that I only display systems of ADHD when I'm under stress or pressure &amp; that my attention is a bit low for my intelligence (something like that).   Personally, I believe the tests were super easy even though he said they were 'college-level' (I'm a 23, male, grad student btw).  I honestly think I have ADHD-PI despite what the test results say.  On the bright side, he will be mailing my report to me in about 3 weeks (why does it take so long?) &amp; said I should speak to a physician about possible treatment.  What is the chance of me being prescribed medication even if my psychiatrist says I don't have ADHD?
I	start.	I was just prescribed 20mg vyvanse xr/day but I'm not too sure how that dosage compares to other ADHD meds.  I've tried adderall and dexedrine and for both of those I find 15-20mg is a good dose that will last all day without being too strong.  But I've heard mixed things about vyvanse, some say that it's much weaker.  Anyone have experience with trying different meds? I'm just wondering how the dosages and effects of vyvanse compare to other meds.    Also one more question, what are peoples' experiences drinking coffee with medication? I'm a regular coffee drinker, at least one in the morning then sometimes one or two throughout the day.  But I feel like it might be a bit too much stimulation to drink it while on medication, especially since I'm normally a sweaty person.  Should I try and cut down on coffee? Just stop drinking it altogether?  Edit: I should add the info I'm going off of is a friend who has the same prescription, he said that his 20mg of vyvanse has the effect of less than 10mg of adderall, but that seems wrong to me.  I guess I'll find out tomorrow when I start. 
Lately,	thanks	Lately, I've been having panic attacks in class to the point where I almost throw up for really no reason.  does any one have any tips on how to calm down? thanks
Today I went to see some old colleagues	the place they work at is closing down	I'm sure some of you can relate.  Lately it's been getting worse for me.   <e1> Today I went to see some old colleagues </e1>  since  <e2> the place they work at is closing down </e2> .  I felt so fucking awkward being there.  They were happy to see me but my anxiety got the best of me and I'm sure they noticed.  They must have.  I failed to engage in conversations effectively and probably said some stupid things.  After I left, the adrenaline started to wear off.  The usual headache followed with a sinking feeling.  Anxiety turned to depression and I was left trying to convince myself to kill myself.  Obviously too much of a coward to do this but the cycle never changes.  This shit is endless.  They say putting yourself in social situations will make it easier over time, but it doesn't change.  The only thing that changes is that I get a little closer to convincing myself that I shouldn't be alive. 
After going back on my adderall for school I knew I had to quit caffeine	After many times of irregular heartbeats and situations where my hands were noticeably shaky, I knew enough was enough	It's been over 72 hours since I quit caffeine and all the physical symptoms of addiction are gone.  For over 2 years everyday I've been having at least 200mg/day of caffeine.   <e1> After going back on my adderall for school I knew I had to quit caffeine </e1> .   <e2> After many times of irregular heartbeats and situations where my hands were noticeably shaky, I knew enough was enough </e2> . I feel better mentally &amp; physically.  I have a new feeling of accomplishment, and I am proud of ridding the excuse  ot having caffeine today which I've fallen back on so many times. I don't think caffeine ever truly helped with motivation and treatment of ADHD.  If anything it made it worse. 
This	out.	This is something I've wondered for while.  For those who have told others in their daily lives that they live and struggle with Social Anxiety disorder, has that assisted you in your relationship with that person.   At work with your coworkers, do you see noticeable change in the way they may come up to you and ask how your SA is doing after a troubling or stressful crunch time?   Do your friends that previously not know about your condition ask you out less, or give you more details about an event, like how crowded it'll be before inviting you places?   Do people with a rough or coarse personality lighten up their tone of voice around you? I'm just curious how people might experience different attitudes, if at all, after coming out. 
my lithium level is 1. 1	I've been feeling so tired all week	Just found out that  <e1> my lithium level is 1. 1 </e1>  . . .  might explain why  <e2> I've been feeling so tired all week </e2> .  Last time my level was high I felt nauseated and shaky, it's a little scary that it happened this time without any obvious symptoms.  For example my therapist thought the tiredness was from depression/ending the hypomanic episode.  This is just a friendly reminder to stay on top of your blood work if you take lithium!  Does anyone have stories about being at a high level? It would make me feel less alone. 
This	lexapro?	This will be my first time on medication for my anxiety.  I had suicidal thoughts years ago, now I am afraid of death.  I know it is a possibility to get these thoughts on it.  Would I know that I feel this way? Like, I know I'm not suicidal, but would I know the mind set I have while on lexapro?
I have a fear of public speaking	even with a group of friends if I have to lead the group or something I get nervous	I have a wife, I have good friends, and I am very comfortable around them.   <e1> I have a fear of public speaking </e1> , so  <e2> even with a group of friends if I have to lead the group or something I get nervous </e2> . 
I've	other?	I've been on Vyvanse for a little over a week and am curious as to how it compares to Adderall.  I've heard Adderall is great for motivation, which the Vyvanse seems to lack after the first hour or so.  After the first hour, Vyvanse still gives me focus, I just don't have much motivation to propel that focus toward something useful.  So I ask those who have tried both, how did they affect you personally and why did you settle on one or the other?
My	too.	My anxiety gets in the way of every single little thing I do in life, and no matter how many people tell me it's not my fault, I always find myself screaming at myself and spewing out self-hatred and telling myself I'm useless.  I blame my anxiety on myself a lot and I don't think I'm ever going to be able to come to terms with the fact that most people out there in the world are so ignorant of mental health problems that they pretty much think anxiety means oh so you don't like talking on the phone and will never give me any sympathy or understanding.  Just feeling really down today I guess.  Do you guys have anything that tends to make you feel better when you get in these kinds of moods?  If anyone's around to PM vent to that would be pretty cool too. 
people appreciating my pathological tendency to go off on tangents	I'm just so happy	So, in APUSH (AP U. S.  History), we had to do this DBQ (Document Based Question) essay. . .  and the teacher was telling everyone about how just since it's an essay, it didn't have to be lengthy -- on the AP exam at the end of the year, they're supposedly looking for concise writing.    . . . And then she looks at me.  And she says that I can ramble and rant when talking, but that when writing, I can get straight to the point and also take one idea, and expand from it and develop a whole thing. . .   This makes me happy --  <e1> people appreciating my pathological tendency to go off on tangents </e1>  :  <e2> I'm just so happy </e2>  :'-D
I	this?	I got distracted when I wanted to make this post.  Anyway. .  this is about me studying. .  and my lack of self-discipline.   This week has been my exam week.  I havent studied ONCE.  I have no self-discipline and are easily distracted or dragged into something else. .    Does anyone else have this? How does one handle this?
Her friend now says she's pretty in to me	I immediately went flush, started sweating through my shirt, and my hands went warm/numb	Hey everyone.  I've been debating posting this here for the longest time, but it felt a little wrong.  There are so many posts here about situations that seem infinitely more debilitating than what I'm going through.   So, to start things off, I'm a 24 year old male and I'm a virgin with practically zero relationship experience.   I don't generally have a problem attracting women, but when it comes down to dating, I panic.  For instance, I met a cool girl at a football game the other day (thanks for the temporary confidence, alcohol) and got her number.   <e1> Her friend now says she's pretty in to me </e1>  .  Reading that text message pretty much just set me off into straight panic.   <e2> I immediately went flush, started sweating through my shirt, and my hands went warm/numb </e2>  .   When it comes to sex, I've had the opportunity before, but once things start to move in that direction I start to shake pretty violently and my brain feels like it's running in 3000 different directions at 200% top speed.   Man, just typing all that is freaking me out.   I just don't know what to do. 
she wouldn't give me anything other than Gabapentin	I have an RLS diagnosis	So I have 120 300mg capsules leftover from a while ago, and found some promising stories about their use.  I'm really trying to quit drinking, but seeing as I drink at least 10 5. 9% beers a day (frequently ~15), I'm a little scared to cold turkey.  I asked my psych yesterday for help but  <e1> she wouldn't give me anything other than Gabapentin </e1>   but that's just because  <e2> I have an RLS diagnosis </e2>  .  I'm hoping I can combine this (I can get 120/month) with a taper on liquor/beer/mouthwash, just wondering if there's any experience.  I really want to quit.  I've already tapered off my 4mg/day etizolam 60 days ago that I took while drinking the same amount so I've at least started my taper
Regardless of when I scheduled my 6 month check-up, I get denied my final refill prescription by the front office	state regulations requiring me to have a checkup every 6th months	If this reads as a rant, sorry.  I can only hope I speak for more than myself on this.   I have to jump through too many hoops to get access to ADD medication (generic adderall 20mg XR once daily).    I drive to my doctor every month to pick up my prescription (they are open 8:30-4:30 and are 30 minutes from my work, forcing me to be at least an hour late once a month).  I then drive around the city to find a pharmacy that has my meds in stock, usually requiring a visit to at least three different pharmacies.  More often than not they only have non-generic adderal, which is unacceptable considering the $ 100 dollar price tag vs.  $ 5 dollars for generic.     <e1> Regardless of when I scheduled my 6 month check-up, I get denied my final refill prescription by the front office </e1>   due to  <e2> state regulations requiring me to have a checkup every 6th months </e2>  .  This happens when I don't refill my prescription at the exact time required to get all my refills within the allotted 6 month window (I don't take my meds on vacation or on the weekends
I'm	control.	I'm curious whether this has helped you at all? It's sort of a last resort for me, if I can't get my anxiety under control.  
Just	it.	Just got prescribed bupropion XL 150mg (off brand Wellbutrin) for my ADHD.    From what I have read online it seems like this is mostly used to treat depression, and aid in quitting smoking.   Have any of you had experience with this? How did it work for you?  I'm on day 3 now and haven't noticed any difference, except maybe feeling a little more alert for an hour or so after taking it.  
I will lose her	I'm not the same person	Hello there,  I was diagnosed with ADHD yesterday and got medicine too.  I took the first pill about 2 hours ago and confused was is still happenig to me.   For your Information: I'm 22 years old and work in an office with many different tasks to do.  It is hard for me, to do this much tasks without any Failure.  but that is not the part why I'm asking here.   I've got a really great realtionship with my Girlfriend since more then 1 1/2 years.  I'm scared that this medicine is changing me so extremly, that  <e1> I will lose her </e1>   because of the fact that  <e2> I'm not the same person </e2>  .  What are your experience with that? Will the medicination change my personality so extremly, that I will lose my girlfriend and another friends?
I was hospitalized for depression	was put on Wellbutrin	 <e1> I was hospitalized for depression </e1>   in late October and  <e2> was put on Wellbutrin </e2>   because of it.  When I initially started to take it I was genuinely happy and enjoying life again, but not long afterwards I started finding my depression had been replaced by anxiety.  I try and tell people about it, but nothing seems to work.  I'm beginning to have the dark thoughts I had from depression again but in a more manic anxious way.  I'm worried.  Ideas?
I'm looking around all the time, eyes freakishly darting everywhere	I'm so nervous	Lately I've been learning to cope with my anxiety, but everytime I go on public transportation, I forget why I'm even trying.  I'm just very uncomfortable, not going on  off, but just by finding a seat and being with strangers the whole ride through.  I try to listen to music to get clear my mind, but the stares are what get to me.  I'm only happy when I find a secluded seat, where no one can see me, but that's very rare.   <e1> I'm looking around all the time, eyes freakishly darting everywhere </e1>   because  <e2> I'm so nervous </e2>  .  Where am I supposed to look? Down? Up? I want to have that normal facial expression everyone else has, but I'm always nervous and hoping the trip will end soon so I could rush out the door.  How do normal people even act on public trans? Please help me :(
So	Yay.	So I saw my doctor again I swear that man has adhd too.    I have seen him twice before and always have trouble articulating my problems and making good use of the time.  Today we turned a corner.  I was able to effectively communicate my concerns about welbutrin and better express the problems that adhd is causing in my life.  And honestly he seemed convinced.  He wants to talk to my therapist who is absolutely my advocate on this.  I feeling hopeful that he's sold on the diagnosis.    I think though that having to sell my Dr on this is unfortunate.  I am pretty textbook adhd and have genetic history and anecdotal proof on addition to my own testimony.  My therapist knew immediately.  I wish more doctors were more educated about adhd and less suspicious or hesitant about diagnosing it.    So we're getting there at least.  Slowly but surely.    And he put me back on Celexa which is my preferred ssri so Yay.  
I	it?	I take my prescribed Vyvanse, but not on a regular basis.  Sometimes I will go 1-2 weeks without taking it.  The first day back on it leaves me feeling anxious and paranoid.  I take 30Mg but only weigh around 145-150lbs.  Any suggestions on a quick fix or technique to rise above it?
In	feel	In the past two therapy session I've had, my therapist has basically told me the same thing.   I need to start feeling with my heart and stop analyzing with my head.   I'm emotionally detached and I don't feel like most people do.   She wants me to call up my emotions and be present in the world and take note of how things make me feel
my anxious state	I misread the due date	In  <e1> my anxious state </e1>    <e2> I misread the due date </e2>   which says due 12/11 but the actual final was available until yesterday.  I emailed asking for help and everything but I know it's too late.  I just can't help but kick the shit out of myself for it since it's going to ruin the GPA I worked so hard to maintain over the years.  
Hello,	afraid	Hello, I am really afraid right now.  I am a 30yo guy traveling for work in Washington D. C.  I work for a company here in D. C.  and it's an amazing job that I don't want to lose.  But the story of how I got and maintained it is one of a year spent in California working remote from a sober living.  I flew out to D. C.  for work this week and got into a really nice hotel room that had a buffet of booze spread out right when I walked in.  I cracked and drank it, now it's a few days later and I feel like I lose my fucking sanity. . .  I had to cancel my work plans and really just not sure what to do? Insanely I still want to drink just to numb the stress out.  :( I can't believe I threw my sobriety out like that and I'm letting a ton of people down :( Ugh I'm afraid
I'm	be?	I'm taking medication for my ADD for a year now and I usually find that when I take my meds (dextroamphetamine) just before breakfast I really feel my medication kicking in.  I experience a pleasant buzz (slight euphoria) that lasts 30min-1h depending om my mood.  However, I don't have this feeling when I take it during or immediately after breakfast.  I mean my medication will definitely work, but I usually won't experience that slight euphoric feeling.    Anyone has the same experience and why could this be?
I	these?	I know of a boy who has a thundershirt type thing and it seems to help him calm down.  Usually I am okay but then there are days like today where I forget the meds and I am so restless.  Does anyone who isn't a little kid/pet use these? 
I actually didn't want to go home	I loved that feeling	I was wondering if this was a normal thing.   Like today I was going to meet with a friend then go shopping for a while.  Before I went to meet her I was shaking, sweating and just felt really nervous and lightheaded.  Once I met her I could barely communicate.  I kept speaking too quietly, mumbling my words or making stupid mistakes while talking.     This went on but slowly got better over the course of an hour, then when we were walking home I realised I was fine.  I felt completely normal, actually I felt really good.  I could talk to her just fine, like a normal person.   <e1> I actually didn't want to go home </e1>  , cause  <e2> I loved that feeling </e2>  .  Does anyone else go through stuff like this?
I	advance.	I slowly weaned off effexor over the course of about 3 months.  I have now been completely off the drug for approx 1 month.  All is great and all the problems I originally went on the drug for haven't come back.  My only problem is that I am now extremely irritated most of the day.  simple things make me so angry and frustrated and my poor wife has had to cop me snapping at her pretty much every time she speaks to me.   I need help on what to do.  I feel like a asshole but I just cant stop feeling irritated.   Is this normal or do I have a problem unrelated that needs sorting out.   thanks in advance. 
I've	yourself?	I've been noting through my last few cycles that a primary indicator that I'm in a manic episode is that I get angry at every little thing that goes wrong and judge people all the time, which I never used to do.  Coupled with vivid thoughts of violent behavior (e. g.  snapping the cat's neck without cause. . . ), I've basically been isolating myself to make sure I don't hurt anyone.  Went to my therapist last week, and the mention of violent thoughts and increased aggression didn't throw up any red flags, even when I elaborated on them.    I figure that this isn't uncommon for a lot of people in manic episodes, but has anyone noted it getting especially bad following med changes? I have noticed that it steadily increases around 2 months after I stop smoking weed, which is probably a note-worthy correlate.  Also, how do you cope with the aggression safely without isolating yourself?
I was nervous about amphetamines	I've suffered from an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember	Ok, so I got diagnosed in early December at 28.  Got a sample of Vyvanse and my world opened up.   <e1> I was nervous about amphetamines </e1>   because  <e2> I've suffered from an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember </e2>   (Literally-at least since I was 3!).  I took the meds and my depression and anxiety lifted.  I calmed down so much that amphetamines actually IMPROVED my bruxism! The second day I took it, I started bawling in sheer relief.   So basically, I had found my lifelong underlying condition.  I don't know if I've ever been so grateful.  Case closed?  Notsomuch: turns out vvanse isn't covered through my expensive, otherwise-awesome drug coverage.  None of the slick new meds are covered.  I can choose between Ritalin and long-acting dex (I'm blanking on the name right now) I'm really hesitant to switch meds.  My understanding is I hit the jackpot by finding an amphetamine that also treated my anxiety.  I'm so sad to have to fuck with it.  Has anyone with comorbid anxiety had success with meds other than Vyvanse?
I also was getting major beer cravings over the last few months	I've been trying out N/A beer	This is the first time I've actually went through with a New Year's resolution and I'm glad it wasn't something trivial.   Many thanks to all of my friends and family who had been so supportive last year and here's to another year of their support!  I couldn't have done it without them.   P. S.  I did have a 1 beer on my birthday in March (don't judge me!) but that has been it.   <e1> I also was getting major beer cravings over the last few months </e1>   so  <e2> I've been trying out N/A beer </e2>   which has helped me tremendously. 
he's nice to me	he wants sex	I am so fucking frustrated with my life.  I just turned 24 goddamned years old and I still can't get the basics down.  Somehow I fucking find myself engaged to this guy. . . . none of this is really his fault I guess. . . but he is LITERALLY the only friend I have in the world.  If I can call him that. . .  <e1> he's nice to me </e1>   because  <e2> he wants sex </e2>  
I'm constantly distracted by their buzzing and flickering	they ALL buzz and flicker at weird rates	I have a problem.  Fluorescent bulbs make my ADHD worse.   <e1> I'm constantly distracted by their buzzing and flickering </e1>  ( <e2> they ALL buzz and flicker at weird rates </e2> . . .  but the non-ADHD fold don't seem to care?)   So, with the incandescent ban in place, does anyone have any solutions? LED look promising, but right now they don't have them at the store in the brighter wattages I need.   Sunlight is the best, of course, but it's not reliable and doesn't work at night.   Does anyone else have the issues with light bulbs? How do you cope?
I haven't touched them yet	kind of nervous	 <e1> I haven't touched them yet </e1> --  <e2> kind of nervous </e2> .  I know everyone has mixed results with medication. . .  The doctor said that I MIGHT experience a 'dark patch' later on that might make me more anxious/suicidal, but I'm really just so desperate for any form of relief without doing something stupid.   Has anyone used this before. . ? Are there any tips anyone can give me? I've never had any medication like this before, and the anxiety isn't helping me trust it any. .   Any tips would be great. .   Edit: Jittery!
I know lots of people do that and many show their face	how am I different? Will I be ok	Hey guys.  Im an 18 year old male that is engulfed in pornography and sex.  I am a virgin and have never done anything sexual, but I do masturbate quite alot.  It has gotten to the point where I post pictures of my genitals online for people to admire and compliment me.  Today I went on omegle and started masturbating for maybe 30 seconds before finishing.  Staying on a person for a few seconds.  I thought it would be cool to put my face in a little.  Now I didnt stay for long on each cam but I wanted a rush and now I am worried something could happen.   <e1> I know lots of people do that and many show their face </e1>   so  <e2> how am I different? Will I be ok </e2>  ? I have fallen away from God in this aspect and pornography is for sure to blame.  I need to stop all that and I need prayers.  Thanks.  
I	terror.	I don't understand why.  Last week I was at my normal baseline anxiety levels, I'd get nervous when doing certain activities or sometimes just randomly break out in anxiety.  One day I realized that I was consistently in unrelenting panic over unlikely scenarios.  I'm even in a panic right now even though I can consciously recognize that the source of my anxiety is illogical.  This is not typical.  I'm not on medication, and have had these feelings since I was 11 (I'm 16), but this is a whole new beast.  I just *really* hope I don't stay this way.   Possibly unrelated side-note, I suffer from sleep paralysis.  I am currently in the middle of a bout with it.  The worst panic attack of my life happened during sleep paralysis last month.  I could only compare it to the feeling of a demon breaking down your door in the middle of the night and attacking you, pure terror. 
Just	hope	Just curious and wouldn't mind a bit of hope
he told me to get clean or get out	I told him I was a functioning stoner smoking a quarter a day for over 2 years	Quit on New years after a drunken fight with my dad,  <e1> he told me to get clean or get out </e1>  , after  <e2> I told him I was a functioning stoner smoking a quarter a day for over 2 years </e2>  .  But now its lit a fire under my ass and I'd really like to quit this time, I've been holding myself back afraid to be successful I think. 
it breaks my heart to see how much praise they are getting for their work	unaware of the problems that their product causes	. . . and  <e1> it breaks my heart to see how much praise they are getting for their work </e1>  , completely  <e2> unaware of the problems that their product causes </e2>  .  Of course I shouldn't be shocked by this response, but I am.  I really feel for all of the commenters who have no idea what it is doing to their lives.  Of the thousands of questions, only a small handful are about porn addiction, to which they reply that anything is addictive these days
I discovered that my newly-ex partner is an addict	I was reading the book Is it You	I'm wondering. . .  and I WILL be looking into the psych journals for articles about this.  But I'm curious to have some of you check in about this.   The reason  <e1> I discovered that my newly-ex partner is an addict </e1>   was because  <e2> I was reading the book Is it You </e2>  
I hate a lot of people right now	They've all wronged me.  They've all hurt me.  They all are liars	 <e1> I hate a lot of people right now </e1>  .   <e2> They've all wronged me.  They've all hurt me.  They all are liars </e2>  .  I've recently learned what a lot of people think of me.  How I treated them with such kindness yet they left me with hurtful words and pain.  I tried.  I'm done trying.  Today I learned how to tie a noose.  I put it around my neck and imagined myself choking to death.  It seems peaceful now.  They can't hurt me then
some views I haven't even shared online, some details I haven't shared	I'm not too easily identifiable	I started on antidepressants again shortly before Christmas.  Every day since the start of December I've wanted to die, and it hasn't changed yet.  I know it's only been a few weeks, but I'm finding it very hard to believe that things can change.  My earliest memories of being suicidal are from when I was being bullied when I was eight years old, and it's been common, at least weekly, ever since.  My post history contains some of the reasons why, but  <e1> some views I haven't even shared online, some details I haven't shared </e1>   so  <e2> I'm not too easily identifiable </e2>  .  I chose the two month mark so I don't just jump out a window impulsively, I can tell myself I only have to try for a little bit longer.  Just. . .  why shouldn't I die?
I've tried every form of quitting I can think of	I'm not a stranger to traditional methods	I am not a stranger to r/stopsmoking (a quick look through my history will show a quit post I made on my birthday, I've since failed. )  <e1> I've tried every form of quitting I can think of </e1>  : cold turkey, NRT, and e-cigs, so  <e2> I'm not a stranger to traditional methods </e2>  .   I've been using nicotine patches for about a week and I'm doing great! Totally cigarette free, however I know that r/stopsmoking is usually a nicotine free quit zone (I. e.  I feel like using badges is not right when I know nicotine is in my body. )    Just wondering if there is any subreddits dedicated to NRT and/or patches.  PM or comment an answer (if there is one) and I'll gladly delete this post.   Good luck everyone!  TL;DR: Is there a subreddit for NRT and/or Nicotine Patches?  
Hey	January	Hey gang,  Well, I did right by the recommendation to avoid dating or getting tangled up with someone the first year of sobriety.  I really recommend it.  Now I can see just how scrambled my brain was for the first 6/7 months.  I even tried, out of fits of loneliness and depression and longing, to try to make amends with my ex, (that just.  .  .  ended so sadly and badly. )  Anyways, I have a date tomorrow with a fantastic woman, and I know she drinks.  I've got a plan to take her for cocktail hour, then dinner, then adjourn to a pinball museum.  Not bad right?  Obviously, I'm concerned about how to play my cards with the I don't drink booze bit.  It is January
Kind	people	Kind of a meandering rant - sorry if it's annoying.  I seem to keep irritating people in the IRC, I really don't mean to, I am just saying how I feel.   I am having a hard time - not with keeping from drinking, just in general.  I was hoping my depression would ease up a bit with the removal of a depressant like alcohol, but it seems to be the opposite.   I feel like have been trying, too - keeping an open mind with AA, reading the book, attending many different meetings.  I listen to speaker tapes as well.   I think my overwhelming general sense of guilt is pretty solidly keeping me from picking up a drink (thanks Catholic upbringing!), but I am at a loss as to how to keep from getting more and more miserable.   People have given me many suggestions that probably work for people who have money, time, and physical capabilities to put them into practice (running, swimming, meeting people
After	.	After almost 10 years of struggling with depression and anxiety I found out that I have very low testosterone.  Normal levels in men tend to range anywhere from 300 to 1000 nano-grams.  My test came back with a 131.  Low testosterone can contribute to many of the symptoms attributed to depression/anxiety.    I went in for my first injection today and should feel the effects within the next 48 hours or so.  I am hoping beyond hope that I have found a way out of this hell I've been dealing with, and that by sharing someone else can have a similar result.   More to come. . . . . .

my SO broke off the relationship with me	I kinda just broke down	I've been battling depression pretty hard for the last few months.  It became the worst to deal with after  <e1> my SO broke off the relationship with me </e1>   after 1. 5 years.   <e2> I kinda just broke down </e2>   after that.  Also I have problems all the time with my mother she causes me extreme anxiety and stress. . .   I also have trichotillomania (sp?) due to anxiety.   Hopefully the meds will really help me! They're called Apropax.  
couldn't get the morning off work	bummed out	Had to cancel my therapy appointment and reschedule it for two weeks time because I  <e1> couldn't get the morning off work </e1>  this week.  Feeling really  <e2> bummed out </e2> .  Feel like I needed to see the therapist.  Also angry at myself for not being 100% honest with her and I really want to be.  Fuck 
started tappering	manic and agitated	Ive just  <e1> started tappering </e1>  and already feel  <e2> manic and agitated </e2>  and have so much anxiety I can hardly see straight.   I dont know what will help . 
I	.	I feel that one of my obligations as a human being is to cheer up those who need cheering up.  Actually i think the best thing you can ever do is to put a smile on someone else's face.  It's my ultimate satisfaction.  I've had my fair share of depression myself, but i happened to find a remedy that worked fine with me.  I'm not saying i don't get depressed at all anymore.  I do, i just became fine with it. Therefor i subscribed to this subreddit to try and help those who need my help.  But i didn't really get anywhere.  I mean how honest are most of the posts about suicides and depressions? They may look painful and truthful but i dont know about that anymore.  Cuz i tried to reach out to most of them to offer help or someone to talk or something but no one replies. .  
Strangely,	free.	Strangely, it's an industry that doesn't have a lot of information out there, probably because of its taboo nature. I think one thing I learned was that everyone basically had Herpes.  It was pretty much standard.  I'm pretty glad that I'm STD free. 
I'm	children.	I'm using an e-cig and I have patches on hand (not literally) in case cravings get really bad.  I feel good.  I don't see myself caving this time.  I really want it.  My wife's not doing as well - anxious &amp; irritable, but asleep at the moment.  The difference for me this time is that I'm prepared to not let her failure dictate mine, if it comes to that.  I hope it won't, but I fear she's quitting for me, not for herself.  If that's the case, then chances are better than not that she won't succeed.  I know I can't make her quit.  All I can do is be supportive and be a good example for her &amp; our children. 
off of weed	feeling better	Last year i used to be a chronic weed smoker, for the first semester of my second year of college i was once again a large weed smoker, as of right now im pushing Two months, cold turkey, literally no slip ups had plenty of temptations, and im still going strong.  For whoever is out there having issues with this i understand you completely its hard, it could possibly be the hardest thing for you right now, but right now im telling you its possible.  Two months  <e1> off of weed </e1>  almost right now and im never  <e2> feeling better </e2> , ive lost weight, ive gotten more active and social, ive rekindled some friendships, Guys if your thinking about quitting do it, it could very well be one of the greatest things you do. 
Ok.	using	Ok.  So, basically from June to Nov of this past yr I spent homeless on the streets of Boston.  This was the worst, yet, I've gotten to bc of my addiction.  My parents were kind of worried about me being homeless on the streets in the New England weather, allowed me to stay at home.  This didn't stop me from using
The	guys.	The problem is that I keep getting distracted by the comments and forget to tag people. That said, if I find anything interesting, I'll report back to you guys. 
love this subreddit	skeptical about meds	I will make this short.  I took adderall from middle school through high school than just stopped taking any kind of amphetamine for about 4 years but now I am finding myself becoming unmotivated and very apathetic with my way of life.  I remember adderall made me focus on what was at hand (almost like a super focus) but always had a major crash and body twitch problems, and of course appetite issues. What is the best step to take at this point? Should I contact my doctor and talk to her for what is best? I need to calm my brain down and actually want to be productive. Thanks for reading and any help would be very much appreciated I  <e1> love this subreddit </e1>  you all have brought me to be  <e2> skeptical about meds </e2>  again and have hope for getting better.  Much Love &lt;3
never prescription medication for my issue	nervous	The doc asked if I wanted to try a medication, my parents were totally against me medicating, but at 31 I'm the same as I was as a kid, I can't focus, I can't prioritize, im all over the place.  I will be picking it up on Tuesday, what can I expect? She told me If it doesn't work, we will re convene in a month to either increase the dosage or change medications all together.  I've taken herbal supplements but  <e1> never prescription medication for my issue </e1> .  I'm really  <e2> nervous </e2>  honestly.  
i am commenting here	tell someone	I turned 21 today.  Got a call from my mum and my dad.  They were supportive and celebratory.  I don't really want to live anymore.  I don't find any wonder in what lies ahead. I am not proud of what lies behind. The only thing i am worried about is leaving less wreckage when i go. All i am is a drain on resources, and always have been. I have never loved anyone.  I don't know what it means. I don't feel sad or anything.  Just neutral.  I suppose  <e1> i am commenting here </e1>  because i want to  <e2> tell someone </e2>  that i didn't mean any harm.  I just want to slip away. I am completely sober this just seems like the best course of action.  Why do i feel like this, it clearly isn't the final destination of thought among the majority of people or there would be significantly less of us. 
Just	situation.	Just kind of curious.   Every time I go out on the weekend and drink I smoke throughout the night.   Now the amount I smoke depends on the group of people I am with.   I have some friends that don't touch cigs, then I have a group that smokes all night.   I love cigs when drinking (not trying to trigger anyone) but let's say I go out Saturday and have cigs leftover Sunday and throughout the week.   I don't crave a cig at all when sober.   I'll be sitting around home bored and I just don't get a craving like I do when alcohol is involved.   There will be times where I'll go two weeks without drinking and don't smoke a cig one time in that duration but the next time I drink I get that urge again.   Was just wondering if anyone else is like me in this situation.  
I	help?	I know this girl on Skype that I've been talking to for a few days.  She is depressed, cuts herself a lot, and is really sad a lot.  She cries all the time.  Today she attempted suicide.  I don't know what to say to help her out of this.  Can you guys help?
I	introverted	I was talking to my SO about my social anxiety.   Telling him how awkward I feel and that I thought I was ready to work on it.   he asked how comfortable do you think you should be around people? and it changed my view on feeling awkward.   I am an individual who happens to be very introverted
Hi	Thanks.	Hi everyone.  I've been on Lexapro for about 5 months (initially 10mg but then 20mg).  I didn't find it helpful and found it very numbing. Anyway, I'm now going on to Effexor and am curious about people's experiences.  Did it help much with your anxiety/depression? How long will it take to start working? Also, what is it like taking alcohol with it? Thanks. 
can't do anything other than watch tv	causes no anxiety	My boyfriend basically just told me he's tired of listening to me complain about how my parents babied me my entire life and how I am too anxious to get a job or do anything for myself.  He wants me to just kick it in the butt and go out and do things.  It's SO hard.  I  <e1> can't do anything other than watch tv </e1>  because that  <e2> causes no anxiety </e2> .  I am ruining this relationship because I am such a fucking lame girl.  I want to change the way I am more than anything but it's so hard.  
My	Thanks.	My wife is bi-polar and takes Seraquel.   Problem is - she gets such severe restless legs that any improvement from the Seraquel seems to be offset by lack of sleep and stress because shes worried she can't fall asleep.   She has another prescription that she takes to help with the RLS, but its a true crap-shoot as to whether or not it works.   Does anyone out there have a similar issue. . .  and hopefully have you been able to overcome it and how? Willing to try anything that we can run by the Dr.  to get approved OR just try as a home remedy. Thanks. 
didn't feel comfortable	talking about her life to a complete stranger	My SO is not diagnosed, but exhibit many of the characteristics of depression and anxiety.   She started down the path of medication this last September.   She has yet to find anything that really helps, but continues to meet with her doctor and try different things (I think she is currently on her 3rd anti-depressant).  She met with a psychologist twice, but never went back after her second meeting.   She just always said it wasn't for her, and  <e1> didn't feel comfortable </e1>   <e2> talking about her life to a complete stranger </e2> .   She was forced to see a psychologist by her parents when in high-school, and I think that has influenced her opinions on the field.  I have never once urged her to see a therapist of any kind.   I always say that the path out of depression varies from person to person.   Some may benefit from therapy, medication, exercise, diet, or meditation.   Possibly a combination of these.  My question, is this a common thought for those that suffer from depression?
playing FloodFill	bored	I'm on Android but I'm sure iOS users want to play too.   I'm sitting in a boring volunteer class thing, which will be more interesting in a few weeks.  But right now ohgodsobored.  So I'm  <e1> playing FloodFill </e1>  (Tom Dryer) but I'm getting  <e2> bored </e2>  with that.   What do you fidget with on your phone when you need to pay attention? 
document my battles with each vice separately	they are all their own separate beasts	So I recently had a big F@!k up this last Sunday, drank too much and ended up punching one of my best friends in the face over a trivial matter.  Since then, I was fortunate enough to realize how messed up my life really is.  I'm a recent college grad, living that party lifestyle, but this s$ @t is just unsustainable.  So I'm going to  <e1> document my battles with each vice separately </e1> , as  <e2> they are all their own separate beasts </e2> .   PMO (porn, masturbation, the big O - and I'd even include edging): So from the age of about 14 to now (22) I'd venture down there
[a	share.	[a traffic light!]( imgur. com/WB60ifl. jpg) Red - I had to Stop drinking to stop the insanity, and I had to stop old behaviors which continually led me back to drinking.   I had to stop associating myself with certain people, places, and things in order to allow myself to change.  Yellow - I had to Yield to my higher power's will and yield myself to a program in order to lift the obsession and make my life more manageable. Green - I had to go to meetings even when I didn't want to.   I heard there are two times that I should go to meetings:  When I want to go and when I don't feel like going.   By putting as much effort into my recovery as I did my active addiction, I have been able to reach 90 days!  Anyway, this is what worked for me!  Thanks for letting me share. 
I usually just say, 'no thank you, I don't do prayers	afraid that it comes off as kinda mean or judgy or like I think I'm better than everyone else	So sometimes I get asked to do the closing prayer at AA meetings.  My faith prohibits me from engaging in multifaith prayers.  Like not even different denominations of the same faith.    <e1> I usually just say, 'no thank you, I don't do prayers </e1> . ' But I'm  <e2> afraid that it comes off as kinda mean or judgy or like I think I'm better than everyone else </e2> .  And I don't want to do that.   If possible please let's not have this digress into a whole let's argue about religion thing.  Just stick with the whole what do you say if you don't do pray and such. 
prescribed 10mg of Adderall XR	in a bit of a sour mood	I was recently diagnosed with ADHD (Inattentive) and was  <e1> prescribed 10mg of Adderall XR </e1> .  (I will have been on it for 4 weeks on Wednesday)  I usually take it at around 7:30 am on weekdays.    I have noticed that around 3:30 pm that I am  <e2> in a bit of a sour mood </e2> .  My chest feels a little tight, comparing to about 9:00am when I feel the opposite.  Later, around 8 pm (every time) heart rate goes up (the highest I have recorded it is 130bpm, and my resting HR is 75bpm) and it feels exactly like I just ran up the stairs.  When in reality, i'm laying down surfing the net.   So my question is: Is this normal? Or is there something wrong?  And to others on Adderall XR, what symptoms have you experienced?  Thanks! 
afraid of talking in class or asking questions	I didn't get what was said before my grades pretty much suck in most classes	Well, I actually don't have problems of understanding stuff in class, but because I# m too  <e1> afraid of talking in class or asking questions </e1>  when  <e2> I didn't get what was said before my grades pretty much suck in most classes </e2> .  My biggest problem are my oral grades (Capt.  Obvious strikes again), but I can't push myself for better participation.  Furthermore, I think that most of my teachers can't stand me for shit and think that I'm just a lazy stupid brat, that doesn't listen, doesn't have detailed homework, etc.   And since the time we got to do our classtests (at least  3 hours), I lose my concentration too fast for this time and just start writing nonsense.  I don't know how to fix this myself . . .  
not been hardly able to sleep	one of the specific reactions I have is cold sweats	I've smoked for 5 years, give or take, with only a couple of periods where I quit for no longer than a couple of months at a time.   I've hit a point in my life where I have realized how much I need to quit, for myself and everyone around me.   I'm three days in, and I've  <e1> not been hardly able to sleep </e1>  because  <e2> one of the specific reactions I have is cold sweats </e2> , almost constantly, and before long, my sheets, pillow, and bed are soaked in sweat.   Any recommendations?  I'm really trying to make this one the one, and it is important to me to not play around with other forms of nicotine, but just quit.    
abroad in a major city	alone	Currently a junior in college.  I'm away  <e1> abroad in a major city </e1> , interning at a company for my major.  Sort of like an exchange program.  I have never been so  <e2> alone </e2>  in my life.  I cry everyday, and it is undoubtedly the worst depression I've ever had.  I work, come home, sleep, and that's it.  I lift frequently, but that only makes me feel better for a couple hours.  At work I'm surrounded by jaded, broke, miserable souls every day.  They constantly tell me how bleak and awful the future/real world is in one or another.  I've never been happier than I was at school the semester before I left.  I was getting good grades 
I dont want to tell my family	everyone is getting together for my dads 60th birthday	I've posted a couple times this week already.   I am slipping in a bad way.  I'm fluctuating between impulsive and depressed rapidly.  I keep drinking every night in an attempt to feel better.  I got drunk last night with my bf and friend.  I went into a bathroom and cut my arm and forehead.  I cant stop feeling morbid and impulsive.   <e1> I dont want to tell my family </e1>  because  <e2> everyone is getting together for my dads 60th birthday </e2>  and we haven't all been together in so long it just would not be fair to them.  I cant keep posting on here looking for some sort of answer when the answer is I need help but I don't want it for some reason I'm so paralyzed and lost in my own head.  
I always use a bird as my avatar	was kinda pleased with it	   <e1> I always use a bird as my avatar </e1>  wherever I go, hence the image.  It's not a masterpiece, but I  <e2> was kinda pleased with it </e2> .   Edit - all the positive comments have warmed my little black heart, thank you everyone! You're all lovely, you've all been understanding and supportive of my little scribble.  It means a lot to me.   
The	while.	The choice that I made may not have been a good one but it's all I can really do to cope with being who I am.  (23 yrs single male, erratic and emotional, misunderstood beyond comprehension. ) I asked my mother today what she did to get over the depression that she had endured when she was my age, she answered with turning to God.  What do I make of that? In a culture that is so saturated with atheism, how can something so simple be the only answer for me? I don't want to die alone and cold but I can't shake the feeling that I will and that it's completely out of my control.  I'm only posting this here because aside from the sheer amount of grief that I experienced today all I can think of is 'end it' as the only reasonable answer.  Not even God seems to want to show me a real answer, and I asked for a good long while.  
All my friends have alienated me	I am such a fuckup	I am an alcoholic.  I am 25.    <e1> All my friends have alienated me </e1>  because  <e2> I am such a fuckup </e2> .  My family is disappointed.  I really do not care for this world.  Everyone I loved is dead.  They all died in my arms.  I am not as afraid of death as I am of life.  Fuck this.   
I got distracted from doing my homework, even though I have a test tomorrow, and an assignment due last week ugh	in tears reading	I'm sitting in the library at my school (cause  <e1> I got distracted from doing my homework, even though I have a test tomorrow, and an assignment due last week ugh </e1> ) almost  <e2> in tears reading </e2>  this subreddit, just having one holy shit that makes sense moment after another 
curious	what folks who have chosen to disclose specifically	subject pretty much says it all.  1 year sober.  Short version of the story is that I found alcohol just did not work for me any longer.  I'm thinking about purchasing life insurance this year.  my last physical was over three years ago.  aside from a short appt with a kidney dr.  for a minor thing that has since cleared up and no longer needs monitoring.  ( I briefly told him I stopped drinking and attend meetings and that all was going very very well)  just  <e1> curious </e1>  about  <e2> what folks who have chosen to disclose specifically </e2> .   As far as I'm concerned, my meeting attendance is my own business.  If I did not attend, I would say that no one would have any reason for to think that I ever considered alcohol to be a problem.    From the bit of research I can see online it looks as though alcohol use can quite effect premiums and eligibility.    
First	all.	First off, it was long, 4 hours long.    Started off with the WAIS-IV test which started off pretty interesting and fun, then fun turned into daunting, then daunting turned laboring.  I had to take a few breaks to just rest.  that portion took the bulk of the time.   then I had to take three questionnaires which totaled about 700 questions.   Literally the longest evaluation ever.  I'll receive the results in about a week, the feedback in two weeks, then I meet with my primary the week after that.   Awhile ago I reported about having issues talking to my husband about it, i'm glad things are going smoothly and he's very supportive of me as well.   thanks all.  
I'm	ago	I'm kind of curious about looking into brain training.   I have a shiny new Android tablet and a well-loved Nintendo 3DS at my disposal.   I remembered that the Brain Age games were a huge hit a few years ago 
My kidneys are apparently taking some damage from lithium	get the fuck off lithium	 <e1> My kidneys are apparently taking some damage from lithium </e1> .  My doctor told me today that I need to  <e2> get the fuck off lithium </e2>  cold turkey.  He gave me an atypical antipsychotic (Latuda) to replace it.  Has anyone made this kind of switch?  
being ridiculous	my rage	This subreddit is going to be a great thing for me.  I thought for a very long time that I was just  <e1> being ridiculous </e1>  with  <e2> my rage </e2> .  At least thats what my family has always told me.  Back story: I was bullied pretty heavily in school for a good number of years, and grew up in a passive aggressive hell of a home.  But no.  I could just stop.  I'm just being immature.  How could anyone understand the oceans of anger I tap into when the slightest thing frustrates me? I barely understand it.  Anyone else feel like explaining it to others is an insurmountable task? 
depressed	jobless and real close to getting evicted	hi guys:) just wanted to post i have been sober over 2 weeks now and in this short amount of time have landed a great new job:) i am making over minumum wage,get plenty of overtime,and with my taxes caught my rent up completley!! A month ago i was  <e1> depressed </e1>   <e2> jobless and real close to getting evicted </e2> . Life is great guys,and its really great waking up feeling happy,and excited for the day,not waking up everyday in a panic.  thanks for letting me ramble:) have a great day everyone!! 
excited	getting help for this	I am almost 30 years old and just now getting diagnosed with ADHD.  I am really  <e1> excited </e1>  to be finally  <e2> getting help for this </e2>  (thanks to finally having insurance) and I was given a packet that starts with very low doses and works up to eventually 40 mg.  I believe I'm somewhere in the realm of 16 or 18 mg right now.   Anyway, I have been under a considerable amount of stress the last few days, as I'm simultaneously dealing with some basic life issues (car problems 
went on the IRC here, and got in touch with a few crisis hotlines	glad I did	Hi all.  Wow, what a stressful week.  For the first time since quitting I really thought I was going to lose it, just give up and drink.  Instead, I <e1>  went on the IRC here, and got in touch with a few crisis hotlines </e1> . . . I'm  <e2> glad I did </e2>  that instead of drink.  Now it just serves as a good reminder to me to not get complacent in my sobriety.   A friend - who was also a solid drinking buddy - texted me at 4am last night.  She was the one who sort of gave me some flak about quitting drinking in the beginning.  She also said things like, I could never ever quit drinking and I don't know anybody that doesn't drink and stuff on occasions afterwards 
distancing myself from everyone	I'm depressed	I'm feeling really alone, depressed, and confused right now.  I have no one to turn to, but the internet.   I've been  <e1> distancing myself from everyone </e1>  including my bf.  Presumably because  <e2> I'm depressed </e2> .   I have no idea why I feel this terrible.  Everything was going so well.  Anyways, please help.   I'm in a pretty bad place for no apparent reason.   
I'm	time.	I'm not happy.  I wasn't happy.  I won't be happy.  Death is certain.  I want death.  I'm afraid what I'll do this time.  
awkward and embarrassed	going to a porn shop	My method is to use Microsoft Family Safety and a non-admin account with only an allow list turned on.  I bookmarked all the sites I allowed, and I can add to the list periodically.  My passwords are with a friend and just in case, they will arrive in email form 3 months from now.   I don't have friends that'll send me porn.  I feel really  <e1> awkward and embarrassed </e1>  about  <e2> going to a porn shop </e2> .  I don't have a search engine active or a translator.  I tried getting a trick to work that used to work, but it's not working now.   I have ideas for acquiring porn in mind, but they require me to do stuff I'm not willing to do.  Obviously I could try hacking the admin account password, but that seems like too much work.  
starting to think I've used porn to numb my emotions	I don't get angry or experience other unpleasant emotions as much	So far so good, But I'm  <e1> starting to think I've used porn to numb my emotions </e1>  so  <e2> I don't get angry or experience other unpleasant emotions as much </e2> , I feel a lot more irritable and when I get angry it's hard to get over it.  looks like I'm goin to have to learn to manage emotions better, But it's worth it.  sooooooooooo worth it  
considering quitting my job	it is a huge contributor to the stress	I recently started having panic attacks again after a while of thinking i was going to be ok.  My parents are scheduling a doctor's appointment with intentions of getting me anti anxiety medication.  I'm  <e1> considering quitting my job </e1>  as  <e2> it is a huge contributor to the stress </e2> .  I feel really defective, like there is something in the core of me that is broken and i can't fix it no matter how hard i try.  I feel like i failed and now a bunch of doctors have to come in and change the chemical pattern of my brain.   I don't know if this is that kind of subreddit but i'm just at such a low point.  I'm wound up all the time, sometimes i find myself anxious about being anxious.  I just really need some advice from people who have gone through it.  
I	help!	I am an officer in the military, and I have a couple of things in my life that have led me to research more about ADHD.   I've had ongoing issues in my life with forgetfulness, disorganization, and zoning out even if I'm trying desperately to focus on important information.   I also have a tendency to get REALLY interested in a project or activity for a week or two, lose interest and move on to the next thing out of the blue.     I haven't dropped the ball on anything super serious yet however I am concerned that as my responsibilities increase, so does the possibility of forgetting or missing something that would have serious consequences.     Would it be worth seeking assistance/diagnosis from my base's Mental Health office?  Do any other service members have similar experiences?  Did the base doctors tend to be knowledgeable?  How would an ADHD diagnosis affect my career if I were to receive one?  Thanks for any help! 
happy	be sober today and being the person I have always wanted to be	It has been one year since I quit using drugs and alcohol.  My life is so much more than I knew it ever could be.  So  <e1> happy </e1>  to  <e2> be sober today and being the person I have always wanted to be </e2> .    You can do it.  I believe in us.   Context: I'm a 23 student, waiter, atheist AA member.   
tv show's with similar violence	upset	My dad has just been through a very traumatic event for him.   He is 63 and had a sort of kidnap happen.   The physical wounds are healing but now I notice he's starting to show mental concerns as well:  <e1> tv show's with similar violence </e1>  get him very  <e2> upset </e2>  and he keeps seeing the van. .  He does talk about the details and we try to listen and be supportive whenever he does.   This is very early on and I am concerned it might get worse.  What is your advice for the people around him to help him get through this.  Therapy is on the top of my mind but I am clueless as to how we might be helpful and not dismissive. .   Thanks! 
[First	off.	[First week on stimulatives] I take 10mg of fidela at @7:20 and it works okay (I can tell its helping just not that much, still occasionally become distracted and then miss out for like 30-45 minutes) for the first 5-6 hours, then I still feel the effects but not the full benefits (I seem to get distracted or hyperactive some, but not as much as without meds) for like 2 hours.  then by 4:00 or so its like im unmedicated.  is this because I only take 10 mg? or is it just the time range? I feel unmedicated by the time I start to study for the next exam or do homework.  I have a med check in a couple months, but I was wondering when I go in to see my doc to get a new prescription should I ask for a different dosage? or some other pill to take in the PM?  [edit] note there is no crash, just a slow wearing off.  
I	depressed	I have every 1-2 weeks moodswings, they arent extreme but siginficant enought to change my motivation, my thinking, my energy level and perception.    When I'm in a hypomania, I'm optimistic and feel there is hope in the future and I can do things.  I have the energy and motivation to do things.  I often start an activity, make a decision, buy something.  I start looking for a job, apply.  I enlisted in a university, I want to get ahead with my life.  I sign up for gym.    Yesterday I read my personal blog-diary.  In those times I always wrote something like:  ow I have the breakthrough - I've grown - I've made progress - I'm changing for the better - I've made alot of realizations.    But ultimately after 4-7 days I end up being slightly depressed 
Hey	name.	Hey guys.   I was just prescribed Lexapro the other day, but when I got the prescription filled, they gave me the generic pills.   I've heard quite a bit of negative comments regarding the generic version of this drug and am hesitant to try it.    Anyone have any experience here?  Not sure if I should give it a shot or contact the pharmacy and get it switched over to the brand name.   
Three	soon	Three weeks ago my best friend killed himself.  All I could think of is how someone could get that low to make a permanent decision like that.  After what I have been going through these past few weeks, I finally get it.  Hopefully I will see him soon 
I'm a little apprehensive about being dismissed/labelled a drug seeker	I am in my final semester of Uni I suppose I'd still be in the age bracket under the most suspicion	Preferably in Newcastle if possible but I wouldn't be adverse to the Central Coast/Sydney either.   I've seen the  ranzcp. org/Resources/find-a-psychiatrist. aspx directory and while I could just pick a name off there, I thought it'd be worth a shot to see first if anyone had had any positive experiences in the past.   Also can anyone provide any insight into the diagnostic process in Australia?  <e1> I'm a little apprehensive about being dismissed/labelled a drug seeker </e1>  as while  <e2> I am in my final semester of Uni I suppose I'd still be in the age bracket under the most suspicion </e2> .  Of course I've read all the horror stories out there and am kinda hoping someone can ease my nerves a little!  Thanks in advance :) 
Why	like.	Why is it so fucking hard to tell others that I have this, this, thing.  I know that I do suffer from it.  And I've been doing things to make myself happy, to stop me from killing myself.  I was slowly feeling happiness again.  Slowly recovering.  Only to crash down harder than ever.  I write this with tears in my eyes.  Hoping that telling them would fix everything.  That it is enough of an explanation to what I really am.  To what I really feel.  To what I go through every time It takes over .   I am afraid that they would never be able to understand.  How this sadness, this despair really truly feels like.  
felt guilty	how easy it was	I went to my GP a couple months ago and I had a prescription for Adderall in less then ten minutes.  I almost  <e1> felt guilty </e1>  about  <e2> how easy it was </e2> .  Since that time, the Adderall has helped a lot but I still have this fear in me that  I'm one of over diagnosed kids.  I've been overanalyzing the situation since that time period even though I could be a poster child with the symptoms of ADHD.  What is the process of actually being tested and diagnosed and even after the real testing 
For	this?	For example i am constantly worried that i have some sort of disease whether it be a form of Cancer, blood disease, STD, you name it.  And most of the time i end up convincing myself that i am going to die, im worried that this is really starting to have an impact on my day to day life.   Anyone else think like this?  
I am a regular viewer on r/anxiety	I'd love it if at least one person found encouragement and positives from this	My friend has been encouraged to start writing about her experiences with anxiety disorder.  This is the first of her articles and it has been popular on a variety of platforms so far.  As  <e1> I am a regular viewer on r/anxiety </e1> ,  <e2> I'd love it if at least one person found encouragement and positives from this </e2> . . .  here is the link :)   [ blogspot. co. uk/2014/03/dealing-with-anxiety-intro. html]( blogspot. co. uk/2014/03/dealing-with-anxiety-intro. html) 
i wouldn't get shit done	I've just been a spiraling terrible mood	So I'm moving (10 days) and my roommates just left today.  Even while having 10 days left i got a COMPLETELY overwhelming feeling like i was being rushed and that  <e1> i wouldn't get shit done </e1>  in time, and  <e2> I've just been a spiraling terrible mood </e2>  all day crying multiple times.  Is this level of being overwhelmed just a part of adhd or am I just a dumbass lol.   
It's	appreciated!	It's so difficult to sit down and force myself to read for my college classes.  Even when I do read, I don't absorb the information.  I scan the words but I don't process or retain them.  Even rereading paragraphs multiple times doesn't always help.   I take XR but that doesn't seem to help with this problem.    What are some good reading habits? Do you guys have any tips for absorbing information better? What do you do when you just can't seem to retain any information?  Any tips or strategies would be greatly appreciated! 
Been	school	Been a rough couple of weeks.  I'm 21 and in my first year of post-secondary education.  I like school, but suffer from depression and anxiety.  I've been all fucked up since Monday night.  I'm at a bar with friend and her roommate.  Her roommate works at my school and is a very pretty girl.  As the night goes on we leave together.  We start getting intimate with each other and my friend k(her roommate) calls me upstairs.  I leave P's room and go upstairs.  K has a boyfriend but claims they are in an open relationship.  She tries to kiss me and I tell her I can't.  I go back downstairs and things more intense with P.  Unfortunately I was unable to get aroused  and we fell asleep.  In the morning P woke me up and kissed me goodbye when she went to work.  I felt depressed as soon as I woke up.  All day yesterday I was just so upset about everything.  I couldn't focus in school 
glad	made it a whole year with this stratagy	when I made the commitment to stop my tobbaco habit, I forced myself to think of nothing but yodeling for thirty minutes every time the urge struck me.  Pretty sure that this works by making the urge a negitive experence.  I'm  <e1> glad </e1>  to say I've  <e2> made it a whole year with this stratagy </e2> .   
anxiety	my ADHD	I am a generally upbeat and talkative person, and while I suffer from a lot of  <e1> anxiety </e1>  with  <e2> my ADHD </e2> , I definitely do not have depression.  I usually find, though, that when I am given a chunk of free time and nothing specific to do during it I begin to feel very down and uninterested for no reason.  Does anyone else ever feel this way/how do you cope with it? 
Patrick's day in 12 years that I'll be sober	pretty proud of myself	So I am very in touch with my Irish heritage.   I love all things Ireland and all things drinking.   But after six episodes of pancreatitis in one year, I had to make a change.   This will be my first St.   <e1> Patrick's day in 12 years that I'll be sober </e1> .   It's time for me to be the DD and I'm  <e2> pretty proud of myself </e2> .    
I	problems?	I started having an issue with depression a little while ago and after getting counseling and medication, I seem to be as happy as I used to be on a regular basis.  Only issue is, I still have the very occasional depressive mood swing where I usually end up thinking about suicide.  Is this a normal part of life or do I still have serious problems? 
I had to decide to quit smoking	I am having  hard time for breathing	I am  64 years old male from Finland.  I started to smoke in 1958.  Yesterday morning  <e1> I had to decide to quit smoking </e1>  because  <e2> I am having  hard time for breathing </e2> .  I haven't been diagnosed by a doctor but I am quite sure that I have COPD.  I am too nervous to write more.  Wish me luck.  
They should know better	our family has a history of suicides	I live on the east side of the US attending university, while my family is well over a two day drive from my location.  As described in the title, my younger sister has been battling eating disorders for well over a year now.  At least my parents initially got her some help, but they're the type of people who believe that going to the doctor patches you up right away.  They don't exactly believe in the severity of mental illness either, which is highly unhelpful for this situation.   <e1> They should know better </e1> , as  <e2> our family has a history of suicides </e2>  (I attempted, our uncle and a great-grandfather commuted suicide).  My little sister, in her late teens, told me tonight some things which concerned me greatly (like I'm just a burden 
I had our first couples session	feeling quite optimistic	For those following along at home- Hubs and  <e1> I had our first couples session </e1>  yesterday.   I am  <e2> feeling quite optimistic </e2> .  Which is funny, considering that husband totally won the session.  I spent a lot of time biting my tongue and kind of just letting him get comfortable and say his piece.  Knowing how concerned he is about how my not drinking impacts his lifestyle 
anxious thoughts and the tendency to question things	it turns my focus away from things	That is my revelation after reflecting on my life so far:  * how started to feel anxious without recognising it * how i treated  <e1> anxious thoughts and the tendency to question things </e1>  as bad habbit, that does only harm, because  <e2> it turns my focus away from things </e2> , that really matter (like school, chores, daily regime, career, duty etc. ) * how i treated every single anxious thought as a warning, that i must ensure my safety, otherwise the thing i feared about will become a reality * how i tried to contain or avoid those thought * how i constalty felt like crap, because i just couldn't get over my fears to get things done while everyone else seemed to able accomplish that * how with increasing responsibility the pressure to deliver became bigger and bigger 
Hello	night!	Hello all!  First, I want to tell you all how helpful this community has been for me.   I am on day 18, but I am facing my biggest challenge to date.   I am visiting friends from school, and it seems as though drinking is the only thing on the itinerary.   I am so looking forward to seeing them, but I know it will be hard to resist all weekend.     I think they will understand and not pressure, but I am more worried about my own battle with abstaining.   Thanks for listening.   Have a great weekend!  Edit:  Thanks for the kind words of wisdom.   First night down without a problem.   Friends were reluctant but ultimately understanding.   Have a great night! 
Finally,	you?	Finally, finally got a diagnosis and prescription.  I'm incredibly optimistic but trying to temper my expectations.  So far (three days in) adderall has helped me:  Prioritize.  The jumbled cloud in my head sort of settles into steps and tasks and I can actually act on the myriad of stuff my life requires.    Keep track of things.  My wallet, phone, keys. . .  Was always an endless search to get my shit together, now I'm more mindful of what I do with my things so that they're in the proper place when I need them.    Not feel so overwhelmed.  I have a loooong way to go to get the pieces of my tornado life cleaned up, but I feel pretty accepting of the journey ahead, and it feels manageable.    Fuck yeah science.  How have your meds helped you? 
I	me	I can't sleep at all, I have to wake up early &amp; it's really late.  How can I get to sleep or clear my mind? I feel so anxious right now please help me 
The	way	The last 3 years have been nothing short of hell. . . . from watching my dad die in my arms to becoming the bread winner of the family. . . . . . . i am a degenerate loser who does not deserve to take responsibility for my beautiful brothers, sisters and mum. . . . . . my brother who is 1 year younger than me has dealt with this situation better and deserves to head this family, i need to be banished from this picture, i dont fit in.   Believe me i tried, existentialism, from heiddegger to nietzche to oriental schools of thought and teachers such as alan watts, empty words. . . . . i find flaws and reject. . . . . this is a movie and it only ends one way 
I don't want to panic or anything	I won't be exercising for the next couple days to help bring my weight up	I'm starting recovery tomorrow, and I have no idea what foods I should start out eating.   <e1> I don't want to panic or anything </e1> , especially since  <e2> I won't be exercising for the next couple days to help bring my weight up </e2> .  What can I eat that will give me nutrition but not up my weight so much that I get nervous or back off? 
my parents have ADD	arguments	So. . .  yeah, I'm here.  A bit of backstory.   I had a really strange childhood.  It was nothing that should require a visit by child protective services. . .  but both  <e1> my parents have ADD </e1> , and that led to lots of  <e2> arguments </e2>  between them.  My father would get frustrated by me quite easily, and he had a tendency to lash out at me even when things weren't my fault.  At school, I was incredibly shy and had a hard time getting along with others, and then it reached a point where everything I did was worthy of ridicule.  I honestly did not realize something was wrong with me.  I just thought this was the way things were.   I was diagnosed with ADD at 13 after my mother learned I wanted to commit suicide.  I was slowly put onto three medications to handle this 
In	it!	In the last two days I went through 3 packs of gum and a full bag of sunflower seeds, they kept my mind and mouth busy through the day.  However, when it came time to go to bed, i was overwhelmed with a  craving attack, literally could not think of anything other than having a smoke.  Had it not been for this subreddit, as well as a motivational app on my phone i would have done it and it took all my will power not to.  The craving eventually subsided, they say it only lasts 3 minutes, it felt a lot longer than that, although i didn't check, none the less i am making my way through day 3, stronger than ever.   Keep strong fellow quitters, we ca beat it! 
I've	fixed.	I've never been formally diagnosed with mental health problems.   Depression, dysthymia, bipolar, etc.   They just said I'm moody.   Depression, suicidal thoughts, cutting, these things all used to be rare, once every few months.   Now they're daily, and they've been daily for the past four to six months.   I'm losing/have lost my desire to go on.   I have too many problems that I can't fix.   I'm not exaggerating.   They can't be fixed.

Hi	:-)	Hi there, this is my first ever thread.    Today is my 1000th day free from cigarettes.  I smoked for the better part of 16 years.  Tried a few different stopping tactics, Allen Carr, gum, inhalers and eventually it was cold turkey wot dun it.   I am trying to convince people in work to give up but am meeting resistance.  Oh well!   In the time since stopping smoking, ive lost close to 30lbs and ran 2 marathons.    But most importantly, if i can do it, anyone can.    Thanks :-) 
I	whatever.	I know there are exceptions like a post that breaks the rules of this sub.  I ask this because I went through of few of these posts that were really desperate people just wanting help or advise from like minds.  I see down voting these individual's posts as just hurting them.  Just a thought that popped in my head.  What are your thoughts?  I'm going to guess this post itself will get down voted as fuck, but whatever.   
today marks the start of day 69 of no alcohol	happy	Thanks to the wisdom of so many here in SD, I was able to play out what would happen if I drank that glass of wine (I'm concerned that it got to the point of me pouring it in the first place, but I'm trying to deal with that/figure out why and how to avoid that in the future).   I was tired and feeling like not enough has changed in my life during the (nearly) 10 weeks since I quit drinking, but slow and steady wins the race, right?  P. S.  I weighed myself this morning and I'm the lightest I've been since I bought that scale months ago (no huge changes, but shedding a couple lbs helps me feel like something tangible is coming from cleaning up my life).  Also  <e1> today marks the start of day 69 of no alcohol </e1>  and that makes me feel silly  <e2> happy </e2> .  
I can't really see me been able to do anything in life that I will enjoy and be happy about	I'm just living for the sake of it	I've been down for months and about 5 weeks ago I got drunk with friends like any other time but at some point I decided to leave early and just walked for a bit.  I ended up at a bridge that is just for walking on, It has wide but low sides and I just climbed up and dangled my feet off the edge, I started thinking about things more and started crying and just dropped my phone off the edge thinking well I'm not going to need it anymore.  But an hour later of sitting there I got down and went home.   Now most days I feel like maybe I should do it again and just go through with it ,  <e1> I can't really see me been able to do anything in life that I will enjoy and be happy about </e1> .  So now I just feel like  <e2> I'm just living for the sake of it </e2> .  I don't want to feel like this but I can't see it changing   
scared to go on any depression medicine	all the potential side effects	Does anyone use weed here to help treat their depression? I've been depressed now for going on two years, but now it's worse than ever.  I've smoked in the past, but that was when I felt that I could cope with my depression.   Now, it's become unmanageable, and was wondering if it was actually a practical way to medicate myself? I'm really  <e1> scared to go on any depression medicine </e1>  because of  <e2> all the potential side effects </e2> , especially that it may make me feel worse.  
get anxiety	14 year olds are losing their virginity	I  <e1> get anxiety </e1>  when I think about how I've never had a girlfriend in my life and apparently  <e2> 14 year olds are losing their virginity </e2>  today (my fucking little cousin got grounded for not using protection apparently).  Why is sex so important to me? It wasn't a rhetorical question.  Everytime I think about how I've never had sex 
So	great.	So I know I'm only on the third day since my last relapse, but I feel like I had a pretty significant victory yesterday.  I knew that I usually relapsed in the afternoon, while doing homework, so instead of studying in my dorm like I usually do, I took the 15 minute walk to the library to study there.  And sure enough, around 2 or 3 (idk what it is about that time span), I had some pretty intense cravings.  Like bad enough I had to take a break from studying and try to calm myself down.  Which didn't really work.  But somehow I powered through the urges, and when I got back to my room several hours later, I wasn't even tempted anymore.  It was great.   
My	down.	My girlfriend is taking me home from work, but I have never had a panic attack come on before.  What do I do.  Can I drink or take something to calm down.   
My	it	My ex is having the time of her life right now, she's probably never going to be happier.   I want to strangle her for it and then I want to slice my arms open so I can bleed out  I hate school so much - I'm going to hate universiity even more I'll probably start another v-tech  I'm going to fail and everyone is going to surpass me, the world isn't going to slow down for me so I may as well hop off now and let it carry on  If there is anything good in the afterlife (if there even is an afterlife) I don't deserve it  I'm tying the noose in the back of my mind - my stomach hurts so much, my heart beat is so fast and my blood pressure is too high, I can feel my juggular straining from it 
Through	Thanks	Through my short 17 years alive, I'd just like to ask reddit, what keeps you living life normally and happily without being suicidal?   Even though I know I am young and still immature, after a long time looking back at my life, I've realized that my whole life has been filled with depression since I was about 8, loss of loved ones, and a verbally and emotionally abusive family.  I have had suicidal thoughts plaguing my mind for the past few years, and I was just wondering what keeps you guys appreciative and happy.   Thanks  
I	15mg	I will be coming off of Zoloft, Remeron, Wellbutrin XR for this new medication.   I'm nervous about it, but hopeful as well.  I would like to know if anyone is on this or have tried this.   Current meds: Zoloft 50mg (from 150,100) Remeron 15mg (from 45) Wellbutrin 300mg Deplin 15mg 
I	today!	I feel like if i wanna make certain changes in my life i should start with this one.  I think that we can change our appearance to look better or feel better, but I think changing our mentality and improving it is way better. . . . pornfree starting today! 
afraid to sleep	nightmares I should have stopped having 10 years ago	For the past couple of weeks, I have been having constant nightmares.  As the nights have gone by, they have been getting worse.  I've noticed that they always seem to happen after I've had an anxiety or panic attack.  I actually had a panic attack a couple of nights ago.  So here I am, 3:10 a. m.  on a school night,  <e1> afraid to sleep </e1>  because of  <e2> nightmares I should have stopped having 10 years ago </e2> .    Any ideas on what I should do?  I'm 17 years old, if it helps.  
Hi	advance	Hi all, I made a post yesterday documenting some reasons why I want/need to stop drinking and am planning to go cold turkey starting today (after making a mistake and drinking last night).   What are the dangers of quitting cold turkey?  Does duration of alcohol abuse effect this? Will my two months of 7+ daily drinks make my withdrawal especially bad? Should I be tapering off? I have a hard time drinking just one or two drinks but I can limit how much I buy so it won't be an issue (one beer at time etc).  I've read that the severity of withdrawal dictates whether I should see doctor or not.   Two times I have gone 24 hours without it and didn't notice any shaking, what is the general timeline for withdrawal symptoms and their severity?  Thanks in advance  
I	big	I always had great cholesterol between 160-170.   Three years ago  for some reason it skyrocketed (280ish?)  I thought it was a fluke, and I think next year got it down to 190ish, and a little over 200 last year.   When it skyrocketed I had been eating Paleo, so thought maybe it was as a result of that.     Well last two months, I've been working out, losing weight, no red meat, very little eggs, expecting it to be low or something is seriously wrong.   Find out today it's 270, tryglicerides and HDL are awesome but LDL was like 212?  Could this be a result of stress/anxiety/depression?  Or too big 
I decided last Friday that I wanted to quit	I started down a hard  path for me	So here I am friends and fellow stop smokers.  This is my first time on here because  <e1> I decided last Friday that I wanted to quit </e1>  so  <e2> I started down a hard  path for me </e2> .  A little back story, I'm a 27 6'3 male who's been smoking since I was something like 12-13 really got into smoking at 16 and been a regular smoker since.    Anyways Friday(4/4/2014) like I was saying was that I was going to quit and so i cut back as much as possible that day.  It went from about a pack or more a day to six over night.  It was rough I'll tell you that.  I was gld to have friends and people supporting my choice and helping out keeping me distracted.   On Saturday my friends wouldn't let me have any at all 
proud of myself	knocked on her door and asked her if she could be quieter	I'm shaking but I'm so freaking  <e1> proud of myself </e1> .  I never thought I'd be able to do something like that.  I actually  <e2> knocked on her door and asked her if she could be quieter </e2> .  Like, what?  
I	something?	I was sitting on my pc watching some porn while my brother was sleeping in the same room (thats the most disturbing thing in the dream) i grab my dick and i was ready to rub one when i told myself wtf you have to reset your pronfree badge whats wrong with you why are you doing this and then i woke up! i dont know what to think about this dream is it good or bad? should i be worried about something? 
I'm	Yes	I'm stuck in this vast and empty wasteland void of any purpose for my life.  I'm sure there are people out there who will say that you have to give yourself purpose, but what do you do when you lack any will, desire, or ambition to do exactly that? There are so many people out there that just don't understand or get how debilitating depression is and I don't know how to contend with that.  I don't know how to explain to people why I cut myself, why I want to die, or why I just can't forgive, forget, or move on.  Perhaps I don't need to explain myself, but I don't want people to think I'm just trying to excuse the way I am.  There is no excuse for that.  I hate when people say that I just need to get over it or tell me that I need to stop focusing on all of the sadness and move on.  Yes 
I just want someone but that is really difficult for me	lonely	I'm pretty depressed, I've been depressed and wanted to die everyday.  I know what I want, I want someone who cares about me and is around me.  I live in the city so there are many people but I'm isolated and I'm awkward.   <e1> I just want someone but that is really difficult for me </e1> .  Never change the situation and I'm so really  <e2> lonely </e2> .  I can't bear this loneliness.  It kills me and makes me think I need to get away.  
If	lives?	 If someone who may be suicidal asks me not to tell anyone, is it alright to promise them that I won't so that they will talk to me truthfully even though I have every intention of informing the correct authorities if I hear they are planning to take their lives? 
an hour to fall asleep	my mind won't stop or slow down	it might just be me but it takes me at least  <e1> an hour to fall asleep </e1>  cause  <e2> my mind won't stop or slow down </e2>  
Thanks	bed	Thanks to all of your positive motivations and for telling me to get The Book, I can say Im happy to be almost 48 hours smoke free! The worst time is right before bed 
shit	do awful things besides not being able to stop	Definitely a problem drinker.  I tend to binge, clean up the wreckage and a month or so goes by and I repeat.  I'm bored with it.  I have been better than I was in the past but Jesus Christ I shouldn't be allowed to drink.  I feel like  <e1> shit </e1>  and I  <e2> do awful things besides not being able to stop </e2> .    So here I am.  Just ready to join the conversation.  4 days sober right now.     Thanks.   
want to cry	I hate my job	Blah! I have been feeling like a miserable piece of crap for far too long.  I don't even like seeing my friends anymore.  I don't want to do anything, not even things I used to enjoy.  I don't want to get out of bed or go to work.  I just  <e1> want to cry </e1> .   <e2> I hate my job </e2> .  I want to travel 
The	alive?	The past year has been some of the worst times of my life.  I began having suicidal thoughts and tried to hang myself and I tried it again a few months later.  A few months ago I discovered my parents were divorcing.  My grades throughout high school have been bad and I have no chance of getting a girlfriend.  The few people I go to for help have been ignoring me.  Also my parents refused to believe I've attempted suicide when I told them.  I see no reason to be alive anymore.  Can anyone give me one reason to stay alive? 
I left my job	I was out of my head with anxiety and depression	About 5 months ago  <e1> I left my job </e1>  of 10 years because  <e2> I was out of my head with anxiety and depression </e2>  although I didn't know it at the time.  I took a much lower key job within the same organization but in a very different department with a much better boss.  As I start to untangle all deep seated feelings regarding my old job and manager, I've come to understand that I do not feel safe at work.  I don't feel physically threatened but there's the constant nagging feeling like at any moment someone's going to pounce.  The feeling has subsided slightly now that I have a new boss and work in a different unit but I'm still struggling with coming to work and that constant feeling like I'm going to be attacked.  It makes it very difficult to function.   Suggestions? 
I don't have a lot to complain	my amazing family	I have been clinically depressed for 10 months now and it is absolutly horrible.  I can't sleep.  I can't talk to people, I can't do school work, everything has been so much harder.   <e1> I don't have a lot to complain </e1>  about due to  <e2> my amazing family </e2> .  I just feel like I don't belong and I'm ready to kill myself.  The only reason I'm posting here is because. . .  I don't want to go.  
disappointed	someone call the act of suicide selfish	It's all planned, just done writing cute little notes for the others.   Everything has been horrible for over 8 years and today has been the best day for years and years, just knowing that I can finally leave.  I'm going to be happy for the rest of my life.  I'm at peace.   I've finally stopped being selfish.  Ah selfish, it once made me very  <e1> disappointed </e1>  when I had  <e2> someone call the act of suicide selfish </e2> .  Now I understand the reason.   Now I've done everything I wanted to do in life, and it's the correct time to leave it behind.   Goodbye anonymous strangers.  Live a wonderful life.  You can become the best version of yourself if you really want to.    My best version is here, smart, handsome, funny, charismatic and with a devoid feeling of survival.  I've contributed and I'm clocking out.  :) 
stop supporting sports	they're dumb	Chronic pain/ ADHD/ bipolar (new pain resume) But. . . . I'm obsessed with Everton in the English Premier League and get way too invested.  What are some ways to enjoy them as much as I do want to except don't get stressed out or anxious or sad or crazy? Thanks all, luff you.   I also remember somebody saying in another sub that I should just  <e1> stop supporting sports </e1>  because  <e2> they're dumb </e2> .  If you're going to tell me that then I hate you.  
All	this?	All my friends are having a good old time down the pub and I know I'll have a drink if I go.  I'm freaking out and being childish with my boredom but serious question, what do you guys do to keep yourselves preoccupied in situations like this?  
I'm not suicidal	there's something wrong with *me*	Exactly what it says on the tin.  Nobody seems to understand this -  <e1> I'm not suicidal </e1>  because  <e2> there's something wrong with *me* </e2> .  My brain is *fine*.  I do not need any fucking Prozac.  My brain is in perfect working order; it's just responding to a situation that would trigger a suicidal response in any normal human being.  And considering that this situation could be broadly defined as the cultural and material conditions of late capitalism 
I'm	false	I'm not looking to stop drinking, but I looked around at subreddits and this seems to be the most active and knowledgeable.   I've heard varying things from articles and want to know if anyone here has any experience.    Does alcohol tolerance ever go back down after it's gone up? Have any of you ever gained a big tolerance to drinking, quit for a number of years, then drank and noticed it's gone back down?  I've heard a number of things like it's mental and you're just used to it which seems both true and false 
I would hate for her to have to stop the Latuda	it really seems to help her	My wife has been taking Latuda for about six months and in the last few weeks has had blurry vision and vertigo.  She has also recently stopped taking Lamictal and the vision issues started as she was stepping down off of it.  I know that Latuda can cause blurriness but could it also be related to the Lamictal?  <e1> I would hate for her to have to stop the Latuda </e1>  because  <e2> it really seems to help her </e2> . 
I feel so embarrassed by it sometimes	an impending delivery of instructions can send me into a mild panic attack	One of the biggest challenges for me is following verbal instructions.  No matter how hard I try to listen and create a list of steps in my mind, it seems like I get caught up in one detail or another for too long, causing the instructions to kinda just blow up in my brain.  But most times I've already begun acting on said instructions before I realize I'd misinterpreted something.   <e1> I feel so embarrassed by it sometimes </e1>  that  <e2> an impending delivery of instructions can send me into a mild panic attack </e2> ! What are the most challenging aspects of ADHD for you?
I know my situation isn't near as bad	I almost feel guilty suggesting that what I have might be depression	I should be happy.  I have a great life.  I have a loving girlfriend and family, and a great group of friends.  I am also confident, outgoing, and successful.  But for the past few weeks, I've been feeling sadder and sadder.  I don't know how to really describe it.  I'm not sad about anything in particular, I'm just sad.  It's like this heavy feeling in my eyes or eye-lids.  I can go out and be social and have lots of laughs, but then as the day goes on a feeling of sadness just sets in and starts to eat away at me.  When I look at the posts on here,  <e1> I know my situation isn't near as bad </e1> , so  <e2> I almost feel guilty suggesting that what I have might be depression </e2> .  But maybe it's just in an early stage.  What does depression feel like when it first starting? How can you know before it's too late? And what can I do about these sad feelings? To further clarify, they aren't negative self-depreciating feelings.  They are just general sadness.  
I'm	paralyzed	I'm afraid that I don't succeed, and become paralyzed
I get to see my boss come to work all glowy	she had a great night.   To deal with the stress	I'm turning 45 this year, my son is going to be 21, my daughter will be 19 (and her girlfriend of 3 years who is also like a daughter will be 19 as well).   I have admitted that all I do lately is struggle, with depression, with suicidal thoughts nagging me every day.   This also happens to be the 10 year anniversary of when their dad ended our marriage.   We were together for 15 years and he peaced out.   Since then I've had one serious relationship (back in 2008) and now that guy is my bosses boyfriend (long story).   Its bad enough that my job is crazy difficult with 60-80 thankless hours a week, but  <e1> I get to see my boss come to work all glowy </e1>  because  <e2> she had a great night.   To deal with the stress </e2> 
Today I took it	now I just feel deeply depressed	I stopped to prove that I can function with out my meds and it worked until I got sick for a week and dug my self a HUGE hole in school.   <e1> Today I took it </e1>  and  <e2> now I just feel deeply depressed </e2>  but it definitely helped me focus today.  I just feel so hopeless and alone and I'm not sure what to do
I feel like I have to get depressed periodically	they dont forget about me emotionally	Diagnosed as borderline.  I am home from university for the summer and am feeling scared about a lot of things. . .  I wont be able to see my psychiatrist until september for starters.  I am scared about my parents.  I simultaneously hate them and want to be around them all the time.  But im so scared they will let me down emotionally.  It always starts out nice and then gradually they lose interest in me.   <e1> I feel like I have to get depressed periodically </e1>  so  <e2> they dont forget about me emotionally </e2> .  I dont want to spend the summer in fear of being let down by everything.  Any tips for when you are really scared about being let down? Also I am very nervous about possibly meeting up with friends.  I get socially anxious sometimes and find it hard to have anything at all to say. . 
my work and class schedule	I haven't been able to attend any and the deadline is approaching	Hi all I'm in a class in University that focuses on substance abuse.  For this class, we were supposed to have attended two AA meetings, two NA meetings, or one of each to write a 5 page reflection paper.  Because of  <e1> my work and class schedule </e1> ,  <e2> I haven't been able to attend any and the deadline is approaching </e2> .  I would love to actually attend an open meeting this summer to see what it's all about, but unfortunately, while the semester is still going on, there will not be any time.  So, this is the kind of info I need: How are the meetings conducted? What are the general procedures?  Do you guys have any memories from AA or NA that stuck out to you? What were they? Why did they stand out? I'd really appreciate the help with my paper.  Again, I will definitely go to at least one meeting this summer to experience it myself, but the Summer is past my deadline.  Thanks!
As	with.	As you can tell from my username, I'm a big Beatles fan.  But to cope with my anxiety, I listen to the same songs at full volume every day - is this normal, or is it some kind of obsessive disorder? I've always had obsessions for things and usually, it's always often dragged me down and caused losses of friendships.  It helps with my depression and anxiety, but the thought of being obsessed causes thoughts as well.  in my post history is the story of an unrequited love whom everyone believes I'm obsessed with. 
Lately	slumps?	Lately (~4 months), my motivation has been gone.  I feel tired and lethargic most of the time.  The only time when I'm not tired is when I'm on meds.  I've been sleeping properly, and I've been getting out to run.  With this feeling I've noticed that writing and talking have become more difficult for me-- doing these things feels unnatural.  How do you guys get out of your slumps?
I'm	late	I'm just curious if anyone has been tasked to do something, you *think* you understand what you are supposed to do, yet completly get everything wrong? Here's a common scenario that I've been struggling with: It's Monday, you're late by a few minutes, your boss looks at you with disapproval. **Boss:** Scott. . . you're late again.  Because you're late
It's	all	It's 3am on my birthday, and it's been over a 2 years since I've seen or heard from my father.  He texts me and says this Happy Bday son.  I'm at an impasse on one hand I'm happy that I get to hear from him at all
Hi	do!!!	Hi guys, I am taking my 30dosage every morning during my breakfest.  Today I woke up at 1Am to study for an exam that's at 8AM.  I got my 30mg pill at that time and start to study.  By 5AM, my girlfriend prepared some food for me and I got the 40mg pill. .  few minutes later I remember that I took my 30mg few hours ago.  I am afraid that I might get hurt, I feel my head is going to explode!! what should I do!!!
It	depressed?	It seems like during the night, all I can think about is how much of a fuck up I am.  I go to bed crying almost every night and I don't know what to do.  I have sports after school everyday and that makes me exhausted, but then I have hours of homework to complete.  I just get so tired and stressed but I can't sleep.  I don't feel as bad during the day, just the night.  I guess it's just that I feel so alone in the world.  Like no one understands.  I'm constantly putting myself down and telling myself I'm not good enough and never will be.  I don't know what to do.  Am I depressed?
I'm	already	I'm doing a presentation in class on the social stigmas behind ADHD and I am compiling a list of sorts of frequently said phrases.  Things like Just calm down did you take your meds? You're faking it ect and I was wondering if you guys have some to add.  Also please post yours even if it has been said already
I'm	day?	I'm taking ritalin.  Quick release.  Since I started taking it, its made everything in my life better, I can do all the things I want to.  I was diagnosed as having bipolar before, but even that seemed to clear up on these drugs.  Lately I've been having severe manic depressive episodes every day when the drugs wear off.  I feel like I'm losing my mind.  The drugs make me into 2 different people, complete opposites.  Now I feel scared to take them, but I can't function without them.  I don't know what to do.  I can't see my psych for a few weeks.  Does anyone else have to deal with this? How do you get through the 2-hour nightmare at the end of every day?
I	again.	I posted on confessiom that i feel happy thinking of dying or suicide.  Even though i have been couple weeks free, i still remember being pure happy dying.  I'm scared that i will hurt the ones that ar close to me and my one item started fading.  The thoughts of dying and suicide is starts coming around and when it does i may not liv through the fantasies again.  
I	anxiety.	I have suffered some form of anxiety my whole life, but I never realized it, it just was me.  Three months ago I began suffering such intense panic attacks I thought I was dying.  Now I have what seems like constant anxiousness and panic attacks pretty regularly.  Some days I just think oh my god I just want to feel normal.  I'm seeing a therapist who's helping me to get to the root of it.  I guess my question is how do I accept that this is a part of who I am? I feel like if I can get over the I'm crazy thoughts I will have an easier time conquering this beast.  I just want to be happy again and not feel so much fear of the anxiety.  
taken	now.	taken 3 x 20mg ritalin today.  i think they just wore off.  felt paralyzed for half an hour, couldnt move but i could think.  Couldnt open my eyes, like inifinte tiredness.  im having trouble speaking and thinking now.  has anyone else had this? or could it be something else.  My legs are aching bad now. 
To	them?	To give a bit of background, I'm 20, was diagnosed a year ago with ADD and am now on 36mg Concerta (may rise).  I live in the UK and I'm not sure which of the 'types' of ADHD I have? For as long as I can remember I have had moments when I get irrationally (or rationally) angry for just a brief moment of time.  I just get the desire to hit something, usually the wall or the table, and after my outburst I feel fine.  Normally when I get annoyed at something I will  just vent it off later by complaining to my friends or at the gym. These flashes seem to occur regardless of if I am medicated or not.  Have any of you noticed you having these, and if so, how do you reduced the frequency/magnitude of them?
Feeling happy	I have held on this long this time	 <e1> Feeling happy </e1>  that  <e2> I have held on this long this time </e2> . Still feeling fatigued.   I hope the fatigue resolves soon. Thanks to everyone here for their support!
My question is what physical changes did you notice or do you expect to see after a couple of months sober? I ask	I was honestly expecting more weight to come off	73 days sober after a decade of a six pack of pounders minimum every night.  I'm doing good, my wife is helping when I need it, no meetings, just my 10 month old reminding me every day why I'm sober.   <e1> My question is what physical changes did you notice or do you expect to see after a couple of months sober? I ask </e1>  because  <e2> I was honestly expecting more weight to come off </e2> .  I know I've replaced some evening relaxation routine beers with food, but a sixer of pounders was probably 1000+ calories.  I'm down a little over 10 lbs, so I shouldn't be complaining.  I'm walking an hour a day, 4-5x per week, but the above mentioned toddler limits my exercise options.   I'm sticking with it, but I'm just greedy and want more now.  Besides weight loss, anyone else have big swings in their sleep patterns? Dreams are sure different, some nights I toss or have to get up and do something for an hour or so.  Other nights I'm as out as I ever was when I was drinking.  Can't put together the cause with the effects yet.  
I am so sad and anxious all the time	I just want to talk	I just need someone to talk to.   <e1> I am so sad and anxious all the time </e1> .   <e2> I just want to talk </e2> . 
I have big ideas and big dreams and want to see them finished	I would look at the end of the day and say what have I finished today	This is just a little revelation I had the other day, and I thought I'd share.  Usually, I try to do too much in a day-  <e1> I have big ideas and big dreams and want to see them finished </e1> .  So typically,  <e2> I would look at the end of the day and say what have I finished today </e2> ? What can I be proud of? But the things I want to do require commitment and time
Am	point?	Am I the only one who has gotten to the point of not noticing their routines, etc.  anymore. When I was first diagnosed, I made lists. .  all of the lists. .  lists of the lists.  I would get to work in the morning and write down EVERYTHING that I could think of that I needed to do that day.  If someone brought me something, I asked them how important it was and prioritized it into the schedule of other things that I needed to do.   I also write down EVERYTHING even if its just a couple words to job my memory.  But I don't notice that I do it anymore, it's become so second nature to me, it's just how I know that I have to live now.  Am I the only one who's at that point?
I am only writing here	I do not know what to do	Hi Reddit r/SuicideWatch.  I appreciate you being there. I am not fully familiar with SW norms, but I promise that I read the sidebar.   <e1> I am only writing here </e1>  because  <e2> I do not know what to do </e2> . I have struggled with suicidal thoughts since high school.  I'm a few years out of college, but I can't seem to make it stop.  Whenever something goes wrong, my very first thought is to hurt myself.  Usually to physically injure myself, or jump from a high place nearby.  I feel that way now, though I don't think I will do it. I am always embarrassed about this, because I never actually jump.  I feel like things like SuicideWatch are just for real risk cases and that I am just a chump for always feeling this way but never doing anything major
she wanted to go on a diet.  I didn't think this was a good idea	she had a history of starving herself in order to lose weight and throwing up sometimes	So my girlfriend has dealt with a lot of issues in the past: very low self esteem, depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts (she attempted 3 days before we met) I have helped her through most of this and she is now almost 2 months clean from cutting but now I'm really worried about her.  She's always had low self esteem but she's been calling herself fat and stuff lately and asking why she can't be skinny like the other girls (I think she's beautiful and tell her this all the time, but she never really believes me) and recently  <e1> she wanted to go on a diet.  I didn't think this was a good idea </e1>  since  <e2> she had a history of starving herself in order to lose weight and throwing up sometimes </e2> .  I told her that she didn't need to, she was beautiful the way she is etc.  but eventually her argument of It's my body won out and I told her I would support her through this if she needed me.  For the record she doesn't see herself right.  Recently it's been getting really bad
My	However	My mom stopped speaking to me back in January -- this has been an off and on thing our whole life, and with many siblings she has done this to each of them.  It has been one of the toughest choices in my adult life to let her go to be happy and not feel like I constantly need to win her over.  However
I	.	I got my report card back today.  Pretty crap grades, effort reported as low to non-existant. I thought I was doing OK.  I was trying my hardest to focus, my hardest to get all my work done.  But just like every other year I fucked up and haven't accomplished anything. I see my whole life being this way and don't even want to try any more. . . 
they prefer not to diagnose or treat for bipolar disorder	teenagers and hormones can just be crazy	I have several other mental disorders diagnosed (GAD, clinical depression, and PTSD), and have been on and off of medication for them since I was around 13.  I was always told that until I was around 18,  <e1> they prefer not to diagnose or treat for bipolar disorder </e1>  because  <e2> teenagers and hormones can just be crazy </e2> .  Well, I'm 20 now, and I catch myself in the same up and down unpredictable-ness as my oldest sister, who I've seen at her worst and best times.  My ups aren't quite as crazy as my sister's (but she's also schizophrenic
This	first.	This has been nagging at me for a while now, but it has gotten really bad within the past few hours and I don't even know if this is the right subreddit for it.  At the start of this year, I finally got my first job, newspaper delivery.  While I was happy to get it, several things have been nagging at me that has me starting to question various things. Some of the thoughts that have been racing through my mind are: How long can I stay at this job? If I quit to find something better, will I find anything at all? Am I saving up enough in my savings and IRA accounts? How am I going to live on my own (I'm currently 27 living with my father. . . ) with this salary? I've expressed these worries to my father and he says to just tackle these problems one at a time.  I want to, but I also feel like that I'm a burden on him. . . he says I'm not, but I can't stop feeling like a sponge too.  I'm just not sure what I should start with first. 
I wishes are too depressing even for those fuckers, whoever they might be	I have redirected myself here	I felt like going to r/depression finally to be a depressed sack of shit but it turns out my suicidal thoughts.   <e1> I wishes are too depressing even for those fuckers, whoever they might be </e1> . So  <e2> I have redirected myself here </e2> .  Its not a cry for help or anything.  Just a 'meh' of 'does anyone understand at least why I have to fucking do this?' But of course nobody does. I'm so sick of trying to be a human person when I have absolutely no fucking help besides a great girlfriend, but all I do I use and abuse her and can provide her no real help either monetarily or physically.  So what's the point of keeping your fat double chin up?I just want to feel the pain.  That's what makes this time different.  The other times I wanted help and wanted a painless method.  This time I want privacy, alone time, and to feel it for an hour or so.  
My	night?	My doctor wants to talk to me about switching from Instant Release (IR) Adderall to eXtended Release (XR) Adderall.  But I'm worried that it won't last me the whole day.  What are your experiences? How long does the XR last for you? Do you take XR during the day and IR at night?
I	text.	I should have cross posted it, but here is the link to where I made the post:  reddit. com/r/getting_over_it/comments/25ufmp/i_posted_this_as_a_reply_but_figured_it_deserves/I broke down and spent an hour writing it after making some replies to posts here on /r/ADHD and /r/getting_over_it.  So I figured I deserve a post of my own.  It mostly deals with anger, and the future.  Thanks in advance to anyone who reads it.  It is **quite massive**, but well formatted so your not going to just read one wall of text.  
less focused	caffeine	Hey guys. Right now, I'm on 60 mgs daily of Ritalin IR.  I'm also having about about 300/400 mgs of caffeine, which is A LOT.  I think I'm getting anxious &amp;  <e1> less focused </e1>  due to  <e2> caffeine </e2> . -Just wanted to confirm before going down that path.  Has anyone quit caffeine completely after starting a stimulant med? Would you say you feel more productive and better in general with or without caffeine added to methylphenidate?Thanks!
Feeling	down.	Feeling really overwhelmed with sadness right now.  I used to cut myself but I haven't done that in a few years. . . but these past few days I keep thinking about doing it.  Can't really talk about it with my friends. .  Just feel like I would bring them down. 
Doctor	weeks.	Doctor switched me to Wellbutrin 60mg/day from strattera 80mg/day.  I'm hoping after six weeks of this we can try something different.  The way he worded it ry this and if it doesn't work it let's us try other options seemed like it's just a formality. Keeping an open mind but really don't even want to take it.  Strattera had terrible side effects for the first couple weeks all I did was sleep.  Can I expect the same from Wellbutrin? Maybe not even take it and wait for him to switch me in six weeks.  
It also doesn't take up a huge amount of time to finish	as you stick to only coloring one picture, you avoid hyperfocusing on coloring the rest of your evening	It's something you're forced to slow down to work on and make sure comes out nicely.    <e1> It also doesn't take up a huge amount of time to finish </e1> , so as long  <e2> as you stick to only coloring one picture, you avoid hyperfocusing on coloring the rest of your evening </e2>  (like I tend to do with some other activities. . . ).   I've been using coloring as a way to calm myself down when I feel like my brain is moving too fast and my thoughts start to race about everything I have going on or need to do.   It's a simple task that I've found helps me to clear my head and forces me to slow down and focus on the quality of my job instead of just rushing to get onto the next thing.   You don't even have to buy crayons
Everyone	why	Everyone who ive ever loved or who has ever shown me kindness ive hurt them, ive ruined parts of their lives or just broken them emotionally.  I want to be better but nothing ever changes im just back where i am with more people hurt and me falling deeper into guilt and self hatred.  I want to die so badly but I cant do it to my family, not until theyre steady without me at least.  i just need to be gone.  I cant handle hurting someone else and as much as i try to do it i cant change and i dont know why
I am weary	To carry on for the benefit of others is selfish of them	My situation, for me the largest issue is my lack of appreciation.  It feels like I am existing out of habit, I don't want to exist to consume.  I am outside looking in, I don't feel apart of anything.  Day to day I carry on with my job, family, friends, pets, but it is empty,  <e1> I am weary </e1> .   <e2> To carry on for the benefit of others is selfish of them </e2> .  I am not sad, but there is a constant lack of joy. I was involuntarily hospitalized about 2 years ago, have been on meds, have been to therapy, have made a point of leading an active life with timeouts for self reflection.  Nothing has done any good.  I now have a suicide note, and a plan, but no specific day just sometime withing the next several months. If you have some realization that helps I would be happy to think it over.  
Lately I've been thinking about suicide more and more	There are some things in my past that I'm so ashamed about	 <e1> Lately I've been thinking about suicide more and more </e1> . I don't feel like I'm going to do it because of all the people that I would hurt.  But I think about it multiple times every day.  <e2> There are some things in my past that I'm so ashamed about </e2> .  When I concentrate on these things I can see no future. I don't know what I'm trying to get from this post.  I just needed to write it down. 
life is work or a forging or a garden that needs constant tilling	im alive and sober	When I went back out, I was miserable.   I figured why not drink and be miserable instead of sober and miserable same thing, right? Wroong.   Well I come to the conclusion that sobriety is better.  Takes a lot of work, but  <e1> life is work or a forging or a garden that needs constant tilling </e1> .  So  <e2> im alive and sober </e2> .  Today I will consciously make the effort not to drink, just today. 
I also feel that porn is the real culprit here	me body can't really tell if it's my hand out someone else's, or someone else's body parts that stimulate me	I've tried to do nofap for almost a year now with some success but nothing stellar.  Manged little less than a month a while ago, usually seem to relapse after a week.  I've realized that the beginning factor to pmo is that I start watching porn.  I do that cause I've not released for a while, at least I think so.  So, I'm going to try to cut out the starter (porn) and give myself a chance to release avoiding all fantasy and just focus on feeling.  I see pros from this regarding to nofap.  1.  Porn is the time waster.  2.  Giving myself a chance to release avoid building up so much tension that I relapse.   <e1> I also feel that porn is the real culprit here </e1>  as  <e2> me body can't really tell if it's my hand out someone else's, or someone else's body parts that stimulate me </e2> .  Without porn it'll be much quicker and I'll not be sore in the same way down there I think.  Any ideas and suggestions are welcome. 
A	him?	A close friend of mine has been having paranoid delusions lately and i dont know what to do.   he is convinced hes being investigated by the police for selling drugs (he dosnt sell drugs).   He has been telling me how the police have been staking out his house and questioning his friends and coworkers all of which havnt heard anything from the police.  Recently he has become mad at me claiming the police and myself told that they pulled me over for dui and let me off the hook in exchange for information about his drug dealings.  I dont know how to approach him about this and tell him to get help.   Does this even sound like schizophrenia? can anyone help me help him?

I	too!	I took the assessment in the sidebar for shits and giggles and answered the way I would have on April 10, 2010 (the day before I got sober, a couple weeks shy of 22).  I got a 38 out of 40.  Yet, here I am more than four years later STILL SOBER!!! If I can make it, you sure as hell can too! Keep your head up and remember long term sobriety is possible four you too!
My	anxiety	My motivation is through the roof.   I surf a lot, even when I was drinking.   I'd have to have a couple nips prior to a session to get right and settle down my heart rate from anxiety
Hey	day.	Hey everyone.  Well as the title reads, i am now a loner.  Everyone at school just distanced themselves from me.  If i say good morning to my teachers, they wont say it back, they'll just stare at me, shacking there heads.  A lot more people are starting to hate me now, even though i don't even offend anyone/ hurt anyone.  I'm loosing friends so quickly, it scares me.  Sometimes some people will say hello to me and we start a conversation with each other, but they end up feeling annoyed whenever i go back to talk to them.  My grades aren't the greatest, i'm passing each class by sheer luck.  I hope someone becomes my friend soon, a friend that i can relate to, and that won't abandon me like that asshole i talked about in my other post. Everything is getting shittier every single day. 
I just dropped out of college	for financial reasons	I'm 20 and my fiance is 21.   <e1> I just dropped out of college </e1>  ( <e2> for financial reasons </e2> ) intending to go back soon, but if I move, it will be at least a year before I can return.  My mother is going to lose her mind when I tell her.  Every time I think about how she's going to react, I get extremely nauseous and have hot flashes.  I'm freaking out.  I leave 2 weeks after I tell her, which is not fair notice, but the safest to avoid parental interference.  How can I manage to remain calm before telling her, and endure the war that is about to begin between her and I?I don't have anxiety, but lately I've been experiencing panic attacks, so please help the newbie. 
I	help.	I was driving home from dropping my dad off at the mechanic earlier today and some lady, who obviously wasn't paying the slightest bit of attention, tried to change lanes right into my car at a very high speed.  I gave the horn a pretty benign honk and swerved out of the way to avoid a serious accident.  I then looked over to notice a very frightened boy who looked like he was maybe 7 or 8.  The lady, who now had a very angry look on her face, floored the gas pedal and swung her car across the remaining 2 lanes (almost hitting multiple other cars) and slammed her horn down as she swerved halfway into the shoulder and sped off at about double the speed limit.  I've seen insane people on the road before, but I don't think I've ever seen a child's life being put in that type of a situation, and it made me feel so sick.  I looked right into his eyes.  I tried to get the license plate but they got away too quickly.  I wish there was someway I could help. 
I	sense	I wanted to make a post to ask if anyone has experience or advice dealing with depression and being in/seeking a relationship.  Even though I would love to have a girlfriend I'm afraid that I won't be good enough.  I feel like I'm always waiting for myself to get better and come out of this depression.  I feel like I'm perpetually waiting for this ideal version of myself.  And to me it somewhat makes sense
Some	program	Some of you may have read my previous post: reddit. com/r/stopdrinking/comments/26me21/why_treatment/While, now I suspect that my wife is dangling the carrot of we'll stay together to coerce me into a treatment program.   And that she has no intention of staying married even if I were to do so.   I'm sober.   Learned a lot from my relapse.   Found a program and tools that feel right and are helping me think better and not choose alcohol.   Not good enough for her or the rest of my fam. Seems like a cold thing to do.   Force someone into a treatment program
I	tips?	I don't know what's wrong.  I love to joke around, but lately I've been very serious.  I literally have no idea what's wrong.  My girlfriend loves me very much and for whatever reason I seem to get angry at little things.  Can someone recommend stress management tips?
I'm working at my coffee table now, and it's much better.   Bonus- the coffee table is less cluttered than my desk	I can set my tea down w/o spilling on papers	Just a quick productivity tip from the Queen of ADHD here. Racing toward a deadline? Freaking out and need a break? You have a laptop for a reason.    Try a new room/position.   It worked in HS when you sprawled all over with you homework.  It may help now. I tend to forget that I can move my laptop off the desk.   <e1> I'm working at my coffee table now, and it's much better.   Bonus- the coffee table is less cluttered than my desk </e1> , so  <e2> I can set my tea down w/o spilling on papers </e2> !
I'll keep it short	I'm still trying to calm down from a panic attack	 <e1> I'll keep it short </e1>  because  <e2> I'm still trying to calm down from a panic attack </e2> .  Basically I was about to run a dnd campaign over skype but the second we got ready to go my mind went blank and I couldn't think of what to say.  I got all shaky and sweaty and cold and I sorta just shut off my computer and had a panic attack.  I'm not sure what to do now they were all really nice people and I feel like I screwed them over.  I'm too embarrassed to face any of them and I feel ashamed and like a stupid coward.  What should I do?
I'm posting this because I need this off my chest	it's killing me	Hi reddit,  <e1> I'm posting this because I need this off my chest </e1> , because  <e2> it's killing me </e2>  and I feel that you are a community that can truly understand why this fear of defeat stings. My dreams keep slipping through my fingers and it is killing me. I fear my struggles in academia are killing my dreams one by one.  My first goal, getting into Colorado College, was squashed.  Despite having the most community service hours in my grade, tying for highest ACT score in my class, and my low grades would get me waitlisted at my dream college. No matter
Im	depressed	Im new to this community, and after skimming through some posts I can't believe how much I relate to all of you.  I tried adderrall last week and it changed my life.  There was a post here earlier about how it gave someone complete mental clarity and everything made total sense.  Thats exactly what happened to me.  I feel like I have spent my life in a mental haze, always paying attention but not quite getting it.  My mind was traveling 100000 miles an hour with 4 different trains of thought.  I would wake up depressed
I can do many different things well without much practice	practice always bored me	I've heard this quote since elementary school and I feel it fits me really well.  I wasn't diagnosed until this January when I turned 21, but seeing what ADHD as a dissorder is, I'm assuming people have similar feelings to this quote as I do.  <e1> I can do many different things well without much practice </e1>  (because  <e2> practice always bored me </e2> ), played baseball, soccer, performed in plays/musicals (as an extra), did well academicly in school (sort of), good with computers, can hold my own in poker, golf games not too shabby, I could go on.  My point is that I'm good at a lot of things, but not great at much of anything.  Just curious if anyone else could relate.  It's as much of a blessing to me as it is a curse
My	yesterday	My SO went to the family practitioner for a referral to a therapist of anxiety, depression, and addiction problems.  To be clear, he has problems with drinking when depressed or anxious in secret, but not consistently, and has no physical dependency on alcohol and is not suffering withdrawal symptoms.  The dr gave him a prescription of 365 25mg chlorodiazepoxide, 1-2 up to three times a day, with three refills.  This is for a person who becomes addicted to everything, not just drugs.  To me this seems like just handing him another massive addiction to deal with. . .  And he never gave him a referral to a therapist, said it would be cheaper to just come see him.  Please tell me what you think.  To add, my mother has had dealings with this same doctor and ended up addicted to Valium, so I just question him in general.  Eta: chlorodiazepoxide is a benzodiazepine.   Personally I had never heard of it until yesterday
I cannot even imagine what friends do or say	I have no interests and am quite boring	To start I'm a 25 year old male who has absolutely 0 friends or acquaintances, no SO, and leaches off of my parents.   <e1> I cannot even imagine what friends do or say </e1>  as  <e2> I have no interests and am quite boring </e2> .  My parents are obviously disappointed in me and who came blame them.  You know the real lucky people are the ones who are never born, I wish I had been aborted.  All I do now is lay in bed and pray and get so deadly illness and can die as I am too much of a coward right now to do what will really make me better.  I heard that Melanoma  can be really deadly so maybe I should just stand outside and get a ton of sunburns and then hide the skin cancer until it is too late for treatment.  Really I don't want to get better, I just want to die.  
I	day	I had prepared myself for the meds to stop working.  I knew the first couple weeks on a titration up on Lamictal generally helped me feel good, but then it tapered off.  I was down all day today.  Wouldn't say depressed, but definitely down for no reason.  I'll be tracking my mood for the next few days to see if it's a trend.  Luckily I see my pdoc in two weeks.  It's just so frustrating.  I mean, I'm definitely grateful for the time of ormalcy I had.  And I know it's too soon to tell if I am entering a depressed state or if it was just an off day
I	shame.	I had a lot of problems last year, lost absolutely everything because of drinking, ended up in the mental ward.  Afterwords I spent 7 months sober and thought maybe I was ready to approach drinking like a normal person.  No dice.  I spent the last month drinking day in and day out, culminating with another trip to the hospital.  I kept dry for a week after with the help of my mother but figured I'd have another hurrah last night.  I was a complete dick to my brother and a friend of his, and I lost my mom's trust again when just days before she had talked to me as a proud mother, it feels crushing.  I'm glad that I think im ready to stop today but I just feel so sick about myself, I want to drink just to stop feeling this guilt.  The only thing that will make this better is putting days past this with sobriety, and putting my all into the outpatient program I'm starting at the end of this month.  I just wish I hadn't had to take that one step to far, I hate this feeling of shame. 
Hey	me.	Hey there guys.  I am new here.  My name is Boris, I am 26.  I've been depressed since I was 15, with a varying degree.  I have been on antidepressants for an year and a half and seeing a therapist for a few months.  They both don't work for me.  
This	by	This is one of many situations where I exert my anger in a negative way for such a silly reason. . . Yesterday I put a can of soda that is hard to come by in the freezer so I can get it to be cold faster.  One hour later, I notice that it's gone and got really angry.  I asked me sister if she drank it and she said she did.  Here were the words I vaguely remember:Are you fucking serious?I put it in the fucking freezer so I could have it There was only one in the fucking freezerIn the angriest voice I could imagine.  I knocked over some stuff and slammed my room door in order to prevent any physical confrontation in that state. . . Almost immediately afterwards I felt bad about what I did and it was just a can of soda(though hard to come by
I	screwed	I felt a lot of anxiety being away from daily porn, weed, and gambling on and off with big highs and big lows as well as anti depressant and xanas and being around really negative people before that the last 3 years ive been waking up and getting high porn gambling in my parents basement now I feel so unmotivated in life no drive constant anxiety depression I dunno what I want/need to do I really dont want to wake up and have to go meditate, go to the gym, do yoga, study a certification of some sort and start college. .  i mean will this make me happy? I feel like there is nothing that can make me happy I feel the brain chemistry is so screwed
To	points	To start, I have been depressed for a few years and just posted my first post there, I have cluster headaches and I have tried about every medication for it and none have helped, and recently I have been having psychotic depression.  All I can hear is do it and worthless etc.  I know that the voices I hear are fake but they have points
i'm	long.	i'm curious to see if my experience is similar to anyone else on here.  last few months my depression has come in waves throughout the day.  i will feel good for twenty minutes, and then slam into a dark depression for another twenty minutes.  this continues all day long, and the times can vary greatly.  it's really killing me right now, i can feel the change coming and it just really fucks with my head.  my impression is that when people are depressed they stay in a depressed mood for a decent length of time.  it is brutal feeling normal and happy and then bouncing to wanting to kill myself all day long. 
I	time.	I had a five day streak, then restarted right away and made it to 12 days.  Now I'm back dayum.  :P The problem is I started to rationalise and tone down my bad feelings towards P.  Going to try better this time.  
I	dose?	I often feel very ambitious.  For example, I get an idea for a book.  I'm excited and I could spend the night thinking about it and even maybe write 3-4 pages of something that night.  The next morning, however, when I return to it, I have no excitement left.  I'm bored and I start another project, one thats exciting and gives me that creative rush.  I need the rush like a drug.  Next morning, I repeat the process.  Its terrible because, in the end, I never end up accomplishing anything.  I'm on 20mg XR Adderall but I dont think its helping it much.  Perhaps its time to up the dose?
I was wondering how other people with adhd perform during the morning	it's a point of much frustration for me	Currently in the process of getting diagnosed with adhd inattentive type  (not 100% confirmed yet, but almost) and  <e1> I was wondering how other people with adhd perform during the morning </e1> , as  <e2> it's a point of much frustration for me </e2> . A typical morning for me1.  Alarm goes off, I sleep through it2.  Alarm 2 goes off, snooze it until. . 3.  My mother comes and wakes me up.  At this point I'm extremely grumpy, I feel frustrated and I cannot for the life of me think a single rational thought. 4.  For the next 30-40 minutes or so I walk around in a haze, get nothing done.  Often lie down on the floor/bed/sofa and fall asleep again. 5.  5 minutes until I have to go, haven't eaten or brushed my teeth and have no idea where my wallet or phone is (latter usually has no battery left anyways).  Suddenly super stressed6.  10 minutes since I should have left, running out of the house, have probably forgotten something7.  5 minutes later the early morning haze is clearing up and I'm starting to function betterEnglish is my second language and I'm a bit tired, so please bear with me regarding poor sentence structuring/grammar. 
Confrontation always makes me super anxious but I've been trying to do more of it	it's important when things aren't going well	 <e1> Confrontation always makes me super anxious but I've been trying to do more of it </e1>  because  <e2> it's important when things aren't going well </e2> .  But man it's hard, and the moment I tend to bring up things I'm uncomfortable with I just tend to want to make them go away and be fine with things to stop the anxiety.  Anyway, circumstances mean my support network is weakened at the moment, and it sucks. 
I	inducing?	I have my first appointment for one tomorrow and am just curious of others' experiences.  Did it cause you to be more anxious? Did you freak? Or was it nice and relaxing, non-anxiety inducing?
he said that I had borderline personality disorder	what exactly does this mean	hey all.  24 year old dude here with a long, long history of mental health treatmenti recently went met with a new psych, and I made a promise to myself beforehand to be 100% honest about anything I could think of when I met with him (I have a hard time trusting psychs/counselors/doctors/etc, so i often omit large portions of my problems).   after filling out a bunch of personality stuff and talking to him for like an hour and a half,  <e1> he said that I had borderline personality disorder </e1> . so  <e2> what exactly does this mean </e2> ?  the only things i've ever heard about BPD are all bad.   am i just going to be incapable of having stable relationships for the rest of my life or what?  I feel so fucking empty right now, like literally nothing I will ever do will have purpose.   I know I'm overreacting but i don't know.   any tips?and sorry if i offended anyone accidentally, i don't mean anything except to reflect my feelings right now
I	ER).	I was diagnosed with ADHD and GAD/Social anxiety about 2 years ago while I was still in college.  The psych I was seeing then was luckily very nice and helpful and I was able to find a medication combo that worked extremely well for me.  After I graduated though, I moved overseas (I did try a few psychs here, but none of them were helpful though, in fact most were super insulting.  They completely dismissed the ADHD and pretty much told me to 'get over' my anxiety issues. . .  but that's another story).  So anyway, I'm moving back to the U. S.  in the summer to start graduate school, and now I'm concerned about seeing a new psych, probably because of the bad experiences I've had while abroad.  Does anyone have any experience with moving to a new city and seeing a new doctor? I just want to get the same medicine I was on before, but I'm honestly terrified that they'll think I'm a drug seeker (I was on 30 mg Adderall IR, 30 mg Adderall XR, and 1 mg Xanax ER).  
I'm	solutions	I'm French, 35% of smokers here, more than all neighbors countries. .  com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Who-Smokes-Most. jpg I'm wanting to live somewhere without the stress of being surrounded by smokers, not especially an extreme place like Antartica or Greenland (Not Alasksa either, they have a high smoker rate, among all USA states)It could be a warm or cold place (not too extreme) windy, or rainy (those places are more likely to have less smokers?)Where could I go  who. int/tobacco/surveillance/policy/country_profile/en/, to minimize the presence of smokers? and still go in a place with active employment in Research and Computer Science? Maybe there's no solutions
I become very tense and anxious (requiring medication)	I'm afraid of what people will say about me	I've been depressed for many years now.  I have been to counseling which did help.  I have tried medication but it just made me numb.  I've been trying to figure out what is wrong and I think I can express it. 1.  I feel no joy at ANYTHING.  Financial windfall. . . nothing.  Wife is great to me. . . nothing.  Everything in life going well. . . nothing.  I want to feel happiness. 2.  I prefer to be alone.  When other people are around me I feel like everything I do is judged.   <e1> I become very tense and anxious (requiring medication) </e1>  because  <e2> I'm afraid of what people will say about me </e2> .  3.  I either sleep or watch tv as much as possible.  It crowds out the thoughts in my own mind but then I feel like I'm not doing anything.  So that's me in a nut (haha) shell.  Any thoughts on how I can transition to being a happier person? I know everyone here is looking for the same thing but perhaps there are coping mechanisms you could share with me. 
I had to share with you guys	your stories and your responses to my own posts helped me to push me forward	I hurt myself majorly twice last summer.  I have been freaking out all weekend waiting for my grades to come in.  And I just found out that I Graduated! I now officially have completed all requirements for a Bachelor's Degree in Biology.  I have never been so happy to see a D on my grades lol.  My depression has been pretty severe all year and it has been super hard just to get out of bed and force myself to make the one hour commute to my university but I finally did it.  I feel so fucking elated and I am crying which is weird.   <e1> I had to share with you guys </e1>  because  <e2> your stories and your responses to my own posts helped me to push me forward </e2>  so thank you r/depression.  
I	arrogant	I am still arrogant
I	help.	I need to record a message for my voicemail, but I get anxious at the thought of using my own voice.   Does anyone know of an online service where I can download a recording to use?  (Or any other suggestions?)  Thanks for your help. 
she keeps telling me I need to quit smoking cigarettes	I thought maybe I could use that to help motivate her or something	Recently I met an amazing girl and got her out of a trap house.  We went out last night and she ended up smokeing a little meth.  After she came back she asked me what was wrong I just told her I was tired.  I'm not sure how to talk to her about it.  Shes got a history of addiction to different drugs so I'm worried this isn't a one time thing.  Id like to help her get off it if possible and anything else she may be on.  I know I cant force it on her to quit and that she has to want to herself.  Just maybe what do I say how can I help/be there for her? I'm really not sure what to do  <e1> she keeps telling me I need to quit smoking cigarettes </e1>  so  <e2> I thought maybe I could use that to help motivate her or something </e2> . 
I'm also a little afraid to ask my parents to make the appointment	fear that they will just think I'm trying to get Adderal for recreational use	Hey /r/ADHD! There is a history of ADHD/ADD in my family, my dad has it, and my brother has it.  I've been experiencing symptoms for a few years now, but I'm not really sure who to talk to about it.  My brother, I believe, goes to a therapist, however I've seen story's of people going to all different kinds of doctors.  Which one should I go to?  <e1> I'm also a little afraid to ask my parents to make the appointment </e1> , for  <e2> fear that they will just think I'm trying to get Adderal for recreational use </e2> .  Any advice you guys can give would be immensely helpful! 
I	effects	I feel like my life has been destroyed by roughly a week of poor judgement.  I'll try to keep this succinct as I'm at work.  Back in April, I had been already fighting a severe anxiety/depression episode since early February which started with a mental breakdown.  Due to extreme stress and anxiety, my free testosterone lowered to critically low levels, 161. Unfortunately, on April 7, after discussing with my doctor, she suggested Celexa (citalopram hbr) @ 20mg to help with the depression/anxiety I was facing.  I was hesitant to take it after reading the Wikipedia and seeing the side effects
I'm 100% certain that borth instances were the result of my inattentiveness	nothing was ever stolen	&gt;  imgur. com/wTfDvBm. jpgNote that this is also the second time this has happened to me.  The first time was the same occurrence, leaving the door wide open, with a polite note.   <e1> I'm 100% certain that borth instances were the result of my inattentiveness </e1>  because  <e2> nothing was ever stolen </e2> . I'm also thinking if I should show BOTH notes to the psychiatrist I'm meeting tomorrow. . . 
My	group.	My step-son was just dignaosed with adhd and has been prescribed adderall in a low dose with time release.  This has all happened very quickly in about 4 weeks.  Since we only have him part of the time, what are some of the things we can do to set him up for success? Is there anything we should avoid? How do we know when it's his adhd vs being a 7 yr old boy? I have been doing some research but there isn't a lot out there for his age group. 
We	minutes	We had come just come home together, after being out for her college admission stuff and I was ranting about something and she suddenly stopped talking and looked seriously tensed.  I asked her What's wrong.  She didn't reply.  Then she went away in her room.  After 5 minutes
the only self-destructive behaviour I have left is sex	I used to have one night stands with people I neither like nor were attracted to just to try and feel something	i can't afford to get drunk  psychoactive drugs are obv a bigger risk for us than for most  and I'm not allowed to self-harm anymore   <e1> the only self-destructive behaviour I have left is sex </e1> .    <e2> I used to have one night stands with people I neither like nor were attracted to just to try and feel something </e2> .   I'm getting bad again and this is my next resort.   I want to have shitty sex with men and women I'll never see again, who will either totally objectify me so I don't need to worry about what they think or feel, or who will forever after think of me as a mistake they learned from.    I'm neither good looking enough or charming enough to actually get laid like this, and I have no idea how to navigate Tinder with that in mind.    I don't know what to do. 
I believed her when she said that she was on the pill	I didn't use a condom	I'll keep it brief.   I have anxiety about a number of things, but sex provokes it more than anything else.   The fear of getting a girl pregnant or contracting an STD are both horrible to think about.   Recently, I hooked up with a girl I know from my university.   I don't think she has any STD's, but  <e1> I believed her when she said that she was on the pill </e1> , so  <e2> I didn't use a condom </e2> .   (I was the one who asked to go without; she didn't try to talk me into it or anything. )  I pulled out, however. Now, intellectually I know how unlikely it is that she would try to use me to get pregnant by lying about being on the pill.   She's fairly intelligent, has one year left at an expensive private university, has maintained several long-term friendships, has expressed an unwillingness to have kids in the past and turned down a long-term boyfriend who proposed to her because she didn't want to be ied down.   She plans to go to grad school
I'm toying with the idea of starting a business	I'm tired of my livelihood being at the whim of corporate drones	I was laid off for the second time in as many years this past Thursday.   Nothing to do with being ADHD, but everything to do with corporate BS.    <e1> I'm toying with the idea of starting a business </e1> , cause  <e2> I'm tired of my livelihood being at the whim of corporate drones </e2> .   But, I'm afraid if I do my attention problems will cause it to fail.   Does anyone here run their own business?  Does your ADHD cause any problems? 
Idk	me.	Idk what all these mixed emotions i feel are trying to convey but i do know that im confused and feeling very despondent and unmotivated.  im forcing myself to do what i need to but theres no satisfaction in anything i do.  Im starting to scheme and figure out ways to use but i try to cut that thought process and think something else.  but with no avail it always goes back to copping.  i just had to vent somewhere.  Hope you're all having a better day then me. 
First	can't.	First of all, sorry for my possible bad english, I'm not north american or english, so. . .  whatever, help me out, please!I used to read like 2-3 books a bimester, but now I get too anxious and tense to read.  I know there's probably a problem in my life that I didn't deal with and it's coming back like a snowball.  The thing is, I **WANT** to read The Bell Jar, a Sylvia Plath's book and I just can't. 
Just	myself.	Just stopped drinking last Thursday.  I was inspired by a close friend that decided to recover about 4 months ago.  I was inspired by how happy, healthy, and strong he seemed.  Feeling nervous, but excited.  Just wanted to write this post to say how awesome friends are.  So glad I had someone in my life that could lead by example.  Without that, quitting may have never really entered into my mind.  Ready to start respecting myself. 
I'm back at home without counseling and without really anyone to talk to	a lot of my friends aren't home	I've known that I tend to get anxious to the point of disassociation, but my disassociation got incredibly bad this where, where I went into a funk every semester and from then on would disassociate on a weekly basis.  I started seeing counseling which helped a bit, especially in recognizing when I'm starting a period of disassociating but now  <e1> I'm back at home without counseling and without really anyone to talk to </e1> , since  <e2> a lot of my friends aren't home </e2> .  I had an emotional breakdown saturday night, the result of family issues and general anxiety about the usual things and I've also been getting acute panic attacks every day, and sometimes twice a day.  I don't know what to do or how to deal with it and I just really want to be okay and function normally.  Any suggestions? 
I started hyperventilating and ended up going to the ER	I was so scared I was going to die	I posted a few days ago about having to go the ER for a panic attack.  I've been dealing with anxiety for about 3 years now and have been on Citalopram for the majority of that time.  I've been coping really well with very minimal attacks for the past few years.  For some reason, I sat down to watch TV Sunday night and all hell broke loose.  Apparently  <e1> I started hyperventilating and ended up going to the ER </e1>  because  <e2> I was so scared I was going to die </e2> .  They did an EKG and some blood tests and aside from some low potassium, I was fine.  I didn't go to work Monday or Tuesday.  I was pretty much confined to my bed.  I don't know if I'm depressed or just feeling off from my attack still. . or something else.  I managed to get out of the house last night but got panicky several times throughout my time out.  This morning
So	decision.	So at random times throughout the day I'll think about work and my heart will stop and I'll panic for a second, I have to calm myself down and tell myself I have nothing to worry about and my heart will beat extremely fast.  I also dropped out of my first two semesters of college because of what might be anxiety.  Id go to class and my heart would be beating out of my chest and I wouldn't even be able to breathe.  My boyfriend thinks I need to go to the doctor, but I don't want to go if it's nothing serious and I'm just worrying over nothing. .  I guess I want some other peoples opinions before I make a decision. 
I get to work sit down today, and it hit me like a truck	I just started crying	BP1. .  Was on a manic swing which seemed to last for 2 months or so.   Getting ready to move, painting, tackling all obstacles including those at my job.    <e1> I get to work sit down today, and it hit me like a truck </e1> .    <e2> I just started crying </e2> , anyone who knows me, knows I have not cried in years.   Not balling my eyes out, just weeping.   Now I'm questioning everything.  NOt sure if I can do it, get this move done, take care of my fiance, ensure that people are fed who are helping.   I tend to take on my responsibilities and work than most people.   BUt now I am regretting it as I feel heavy and overloaded.   Thanks for listening, just need a place to say something, and how I actually feel without seeing the reaction on peoples faces, or hearing the same old schtick about how I'll get through it. 
I	interested.	I know it's been a while since I've posted in here, but I thought you might be interested in a thing I'm trying to get off the ground: [Staccato]( kickstarter. com/projects/868228283/staccato-1).   While some may feel comfortable saying their book is a way of expressing their experiences with cancer, I'm not comfortable saying that it's about bipolar outside of places like this. At the root of it, it's about a character who has needed to keep herself in control and has isolated herself from the world.   She does crazy things sometimes, putting herself at high risk, but above all she takes care of **herself**. It's a story about her learning that it's ok to be helped and ok to let yourself breathe. While I'm not hispanic or female, it's a story about me, albeit in an entirely fictional way. I thought you might be interested. 
the last few hours have been one hell of a heap of triggers	Upset kids, furious spouse, unfocused general stress, a shitty night of sleep	I never needed a reason to drink, but  <e1> the last few hours have been one hell of a heap of triggers </e1> .   <e2> Upset kids, furious spouse, unfocused general stress, a shitty night of sleep </e2>  (worst I somnia since week 1). . . BUT I WILL NOT DRINK. thanks for letting me vent and hope you're all having a better Saturday. 
I	Nope.	I imagine myself before I ever started smoking.  Healthy, muscular (played tennis and other sports), fearless; maybe not wildly happy, maybe confused, but I was a teenager.  Who isn't a little confused then? I remember that first smoke and I remember it was disgusting, vile and smelled gross.  I know I have nothing but good things to gain by staying a non-smoker and yet I still fear failure.  So just thought I'd put that out there.  Anyway, I'm not going to fail today.  Nope.  
Totally	myself!	Totally relapsed on the meth today.  Just getting my life together, parents are there for me again and I have work in six hours!  Now I'm sitting on my ass, heart racing, pupils huge, and too fucked up to do more than just sit here.  Just thankful I didn't buy it but instead I hung out with someone.  Alone, now, and super nervous about dawn coming.   So mad at myself! 
I thought it was 9:30 but he added it to his google calendar	i got an email that said from 9:10-9:40	Hi, i don't know where else to write this.  I finally got an interview! first one in a while and the first one in my life that's related to my degree, but i was so excited i don't think i managed to remember the time properly.   <e1> I thought it was 9:30 but he added it to his google calendar </e1>  and so  <e2> i got an email that said from 9:10-9:40 </e2>  and now i'm thinking he might have said 9:15.  But why would he put 9:10? should i just show up at 9:05 and risk looking like an idiot or should i call to verify and risk looking like an idiot.  Showing up at 9:30 at this point is not an option.  what should i do?
I	:(	I watched 'requiem for a dream' and wow. . .  my chest hurts so bad.  For those of you who haven't seen it, it's about drug dealing basically and it doesn't end well.  It shows a lot of syringes which is a trigger for me and the music made me feel anxious.  It was a good movie and I'm glad I watched it but now I don't feel good :( 
So	long.	So glad I wasn't still drunk or hung over.   Great walking her as the sun got up as well and the three of us had a nice chat about new days.   Walking 18 holes of golf in a couple of hours.   Today. . . I am sober all day and all night long.   
It kind of got me down a little coming from somebody	I expected to get support from	How do you guys deal with people who don't believe you either have ADHD or that it's even real?Example, my best friend thinks, in a nut shell, it's a load of bollocks and Ritalin will give me brain damage.   <e1> It kind of got me down a little coming from somebody </e1>  that  <e2> I expected to get support from </e2> . 
I get canker sores very easily	sugar is out	Okay, maybe not break it, but at least save my damn teeth.  I chew non-stop at work if I'm in the office (most of the time).  I just started my professional career and I have an annoying problem with chewing.  Pens get destroyed.  One after another.  I'm in a stressful industry, no way to avoid the stress.  Gum would seem to be the obvious choice, only problem is,  <e1> I get canker sores very easily </e1> , so  <e2> sugar is out </e2> .  I worry a bit with sugarless gum.  I'm not the type to get overly worried about artificial sweeteners, but I'm not a big fan of them.  Especially chewing on gum all day, which is what I'd have to do.    Any Ideas?
Getting him in the car will be an ordeal	he's become very adverse to leaving the house	I have a younger brother who's severely Autistic.  He's been going through a very rough patch this past year which, most recently, has involved refusing to eat or even leaving his room.  Today it got to the breaking point: my parents decided he's become a danger to himself and are trying to get him to a hospital.   <e1> Getting him in the car will be an ordeal </e1> , since  <e2> he's become very adverse to leaving the house </e2> .  That on top of the no-doubt exorbitant cost of hospital care is poised to send my anxiety in overdrive.  I can feel the nausea coming on, and it can only get worse from here. How do I calm down when the thing I was afraid was going to happen is actually happening?
Curiosity	jpg	Curiosity got the best of me, and I fired up the old social drinking app in which I used to meticulously log all my craft beer consumption .  I found this was my last entry, and the last beer I ever drank.  Almost one year ago, I drank about 4 of these in an hour or two, and then through the course of the night, physically assaulted the person who I was dating at the time. I'm posting this to show it can be done, and to inspire those who might think it an impossible task to put down the bottle and move onward with their lives.  /r/stopdrinking has been an invaluable tool in my warchest against my alcoholism.  Much gratitude.  imgur. com/6qVn0rd. jpg
dealing damage for completing things and charging its rage attack whenever daily tasks are left uncompleted.   This is very important	the prizes for beating Drag'on include mantis shrimp pets and mounts	So, I've been getting really into using HabitRPG over the past couple of weeks; I absolutely love it as a system for staying organized and motivated and its really helped me to keep on top of things.   If you are looking for a new way to keep yourself organized, give it a try (go to the website though, the phone app is bollocks).   I just helped my SO get set-up with the game, and I'd be more than happy to dish out some assistance if anyone wants a hand getting set up.  ( com/)Also, the game just started its first World-Boss; everyone is fighting the Drag'on (oh the puns) together,  <e1> dealing damage for completing things and charging its rage attack whenever daily tasks are left uncompleted.

I don't think I've ever been officially diagnosed with depression	I'm not going to say that I have	 <e1> I don't think I've ever been officially diagnosed with depression </e1>  so  <e2> I'm not going to say that I have </e2> .  I have been on a few different types of antidepressants and have received different effects from them.  But I have just been feeling weighed down and dragging my family down also, and for a while now have been having reoccurring thoughts of self harm.  Basically throughout the day I have thoughts of someone beating the crap out of me or pushing me in front of traffic or some kind of violent act.  The odd part is I envision the aggressor as another me.  I have no clue if this is normal but I constantly think of two versions of myself, one doing the harm and one receiving it.  Sometimes I think of myself as the me being beaten and sometimes I envision me doing the beating.  I have no clue if that makes sense but I was wondering if that is normal for people with depression? I'm not considering suicide
It's literally ruining my relationship with my mother	she is convinced I screen/ignore her calls on purpose	My whole life so far (17) I've had a huge problem with getting distracted by being with people and completely forget that some people will try to reach my by phone.  Right now it seems like the most I can do is turn my ringer to its loudest setting and hope to god I hear it.  But unfortunately last night was one of the many times it didn't work.   <e1> It's literally ruining my relationship with my mother </e1>  because  <e2> she is convinced I screen/ignore her calls on purpose </e2> .

I	it?(This	I drink A LOT.  Beers and liquor all the time.  Over the last month or so I have been broke, like, as broke as I can be while still paying bills and eating. I got black out drunk, again, last night.  (Don't remember [this]( reddit. com/r/stopdrinking/comments/29utiy/1200_days_with_out_an_alcoholic_drink_o/cip7e1h?context=3).  The original post was asking if he was bragging or just being a douche. ) (Thank you /u/Popoie) I haven't got to drink for days on end and I though I would be falling apart.  5 days was the latest (VERY SHORT I know) stretch.  I haven't been sick, sweating, anxious or otherwise feeling terrible. Not only this, but I have quit smoking cigarettes in February and I quit smoking pot about 1 month ago to get a job.  None of this has bothered me.  I just cannot stop drinking. Is the term functioning alcoholic? Am I some kind of freak that doesn't get addicted? Is 5 days nothing on the drinking calender? Why do I like it so much? Am I doing it just for the hell of it?(This
Some claim that while stimulant is still working they sleep better	they experience less anxiety	I'm trying to figure out if I'm having trouble sleeping because the medication is wearing off and so I feel anxious or if if's the medication is still in effect.   <e1> Some claim that while stimulant is still working they sleep better </e1>  because  <e2> they experience less anxiety </e2> .  Could someone like that explain more?

Hi	:)	Hi everyone.  Ive gone through three cycles since October.  I don't really have a support system and I try to keep my symptoms to myself.  I did try to reach out to my ex but my manic episodes led him/her to completely cut me out of their life.  That being said feel that the fourth one is just around the corner.  I might be wrong and I'm taking steps to prevent it.  Anyways I also thought I'd say hi :)
I walked into my dads office to watch him do a line of coke	It feels like any second i'm gonna wake up from this nightmare	For the past 8 months i have been extremely depressed a hairpin away from killing myself.  I have had a gun to my temple twice and nearly pulled the trigger.  But I had been getting better.  Until today.   <e1> I walked into my dads office to watch him do a line of coke </e1> .  My dad has been quitting smoking and no history of drugs.  I work along side him every day of the week, i looked up to him like fucking jesus.  I am having a fucking panic attack right now and don't know where else to turn besides reddit.   <e2> It feels like any second i'm gonna wake up from this nightmare </e2> .  Please fucking help me reddit this is so fucked. 
I'm	(sigh)	I'm used to being up at this time but also nervous about this.  (sigh)
Currently	constructive!	Currently I'm on the step2 (14mg/daily) patch.  My plan is to step down to the 7mg patches as soon as this box of the 14mg/day patches is done, if not sooner. . . then to use the 7mg patches as soon as I wake up, but removing them earlier and earlier in the day.  Currently I've been removing the patch right before bed, but last time I tried this (and managed to go 29? days smoke/nicotine replacement free before I f'd up and smoked when a pregnancy scare came into play) I was removing it it at 9pm vs 10pm. . . then 8pm, then 7pm, then 6pm, then 5pm the next week, and then I just stopped and stayed off for that 29ish days. Just what my plan is.  Anyone else using the patch have any suggestions on weaning/titration? Is my plan good in your eyes? Opinions/suggestions/anything are all acceptable! Seriously, any input would be great! I don't even care if you're nice about it as long as it's somewhat constructive!
I	Goodbye.	I have been depressed and have tried to kill myself before but now im beyond saving.  I made the biggest mistake and i cant take it back.  I cheated on the one girl that saved me this long and i know im going to lose her when i tell her.  I shouldnt have gone out after work tonight with my coworkers, i knew this girl liked me.  I walked her to her car at which point she forced her tongue down my throat.  i pushed her off but i know my girl will make it my fault, for going when i knew this other girl wanted me.  Im sorry world, its not like id make a difference in it anyway.  I cant believe im becoming the person i never wanted to be.  Tomorrow im taking my rifle to my hunting camp and im going to walk into the woods and end it.  Im no longer going to live this way.  Goodbye. 
Mixture of diet worries and not even getting a chance at an interview for a job	left me feeling crap	Feeling pretty low today, depression has returned and knocked me down.   <e1> Mixture of diet worries and not even getting a chance at an interview for a job </e1>  I would have loved has  <e2> left me feeling crap </e2> .  Being inside my head at the moment is not a happy place to be.  Just want to curl up somewhere quiet and be left alone but have to carry on in this stupid body and mind.  I'm sat here crying.  I've been okay for the past few months but I've felt this feeling building up the last few days and today it's just hit me bad.  :(
God	community.	God I friggin love singing.   I'm not even that good!  But to sit down at my piano and play music- and NOT GET DISTRACTED!  I don't know how I do it, but it happens.   Music IS my distraction I think.   And I good one.   Singing- just letting it all out.   Closing all the windows and belting some shit.   It helps.   It really does.   Sure, it isn't a cure for everything that ADHD does to affect my life. . . but it sure as hell gives me an easier time. But I sincerely hope everyone can find something like this.   Whether it be meditation, or cooking, or whatever the hell.   We may have it a bit more rough than some other folks, but that shouldn't stop us from being happy!**TL:DR**:  **Singing helps me release all the balled up problems that ADHD gives me.   I'm sure everyone can find something that helps them-if just a little bit. **Sorry for the blogpost but I love this subreddit and everything it's done for my views on my condition.   Thank you for this amazing community. 
Im	phone	Im only 16 and im currently at a friends house with my momWe left after he arrived drunk and insisted he wasnt and i called him and poured my heart out at himAnd he said he would get help but i know he won'tAnd now im afraid its too far gone and he will never quit drinkingCan you guys give some advice?P. S sorry for the shitty grammar/writing im doing this on a old phone
It's	.	It's weird, after a few years of heavy drinking, in public speaking I feel like some of my nervous emotions have dwindled.  I can be tasked to speak in front of an audience of 100 even involving technical matters and I don't give a shit anymore, even while sober (though obviously having residual body effects from drinking the night before).  My pulse barely raises.  As a teen my voice used to change without me being able to change it, but now? Even speaking to a crowd of professionals barely phases me.  I just do it.  Which is weird.  For anyone in this position in their career, did this change after quitting? I need to quit for obvious reasons but I am curious as to what may lie ahead and whether I'd need to learn to deal with my emotions head-on and how much of a crutch alcohol has been even while sober. . . 
when I'm around them, incredibly sad when I'm not	I'm so paranoid over what they might think of me	Okay I'm just going to splurge my feelings right here and hope something nice comes back.  Even if I get no replies, at least I'll have put my (complex and wide-ranging) thoughts into something a little more coherent that what's in my head.  So I think I've felt this way throughout my life, it certainly seems to be a common theme, alcohol probably made this worse but isn't the cause. I obsess over everything.  My friendships particularly, there are certain people who I just can't live with or without, who make me incredibly happy  <e1> when I'm around them, incredibly sad when I'm not </e1> , because  <e2> I'm so paranoid over what they might think of me </e2> .  If somebody starts to like me, and I recognise a growing friendship, often I'll fuck it up by revealing how extremely stressy I get.  I start thinking what would a nice person like this want to be friends with me for? surely they can't possibly WANT to talk to me?I also have very low moods
My	movies	My mind's been made up for the past few days, but I feel like I need to hear all the reasons against my decision one more time just to be sure this is what I want.  After all, there's not really room for hastiness.  I've been suicidal for 3 or 4 years now, with some days better than others.  I'm sure you know how that goes.  I went into a downward spiral after being sexually assaulted twice by a man I trusted, after which the school (I was in high school at the time) refused to move either of us from the class and pressured me into dropping the charges.  I was also heavily bullied at this time.  I've been to counselors and psychiatrists, and they've told me I have some kind of PTSD.  A few months ago, another close friend invited me over to catch up and watch some movies
I	it	I recently changed birth control (from the pills to the shot) and the change has caused major changes in my mood.  Ever since the first shot I have been moody and angry and hateful.  Now after the second and third dose my mood has gone down hill.  I just feel stuck and I have no interest in anything that I used to love.  I feel like I'm alone when I'm in a crowd or with friends.  I have no desire for anything anymore and it hurts physically too.  (Like I have a really bad cold).  I have thought about self-harm but never attempted it
The medication also creates a greater distraction than had I never taken it at all	as someone who suffers from inattentiveness	I recently developed anxiety issues and worry far more than I used to.  When I take Adderall lately, I go from a calm mind state to an anxious wreck.   <e1> The medication also creates a greater distraction than had I never taken it at all </e1> , because  <e2> as someone who suffers from inattentiveness </e2> , the swarm of thoughts increases to an unbearable level. Here's the kicker: When I took Adderall before developing anxiety, I was completely carefree and focused.  If I was in a good mood, I would be in a GREAT mood following the medication. My question is, does medication elevate your underlying state of mind?
I feel so guilty	I'm not getting ANYTHING DONE	Out of addys.   I'm sick of them anyway.  I think they are screwing with my natural hormone secretions.  ( obviously I'm no doc).  I'm so tired, I feel like my moods are all over the place.   Pooping like crazy.   Lethargic.   I had coffee this morning.   All that did was make me go back to bed.    <e1> I feel so guilty </e1>  because  <e2> I'm not getting ANYTHING DONE </e2> .   Can any kind soul give me some suggestions on how to beat this beast?  
BUT I know that exercise helps anxiety	for the past few days I have been getting up super early to go for a walk and jog a bit	So I am very sensitive to body sensations, for example, being too hot or too cold makes me anxious, or being sick, or having any kind of pain.  Especially when my heart rate increases or I feel flushed.  I have basically been trying to avoid being in the sun or doing any kind of physical activity.   <e1> BUT I know that exercise helps anxiety </e1> .  So  <e2> for the past few days I have been getting up super early to go for a walk and jog a bit </e2> , so that I won't get too hot and I stop if I get panicky because of my heart rate.  Well today I went for an awesome jog after work, the sun was shining, and there were (gasp) even people around where I was running, and I WAS FINE.  I had some anxious moments, especially immediately post run when I started focusing on my heart beat, but I am calm now I feel just awesome.  I know I have a ways to go with my anxiety but this is the first time I ever really said fuck you to my anxious feelings and just did something good for myself!
I cut off all relationships that I had	I don't have the energy to do anything most of the time	I'm depressed for a while I can't afford another therapist and after trying several antidepressants I gave up on them too.  I think the biggest problem is that I rarely leave the house.   <e1> I cut off all relationships that I had </e1>  because  <e2> I don't have the energy to do anything most of the time </e2> .  Just calling or texting someone is mostly too much.  One week ago I graduated from high school and was the best of my class.  My classmates said I should be happy but I couldn't feel any happiness.  When even that doesn't make my happy then nothing will.   I just feel lonely and hopeless and I don't know what to do anymore.  Suicide seems like a solution to my depression.  I don't see myself living like that any longer.  I wish I could live a normal life but I can't.  
Attendance issues	almost solely on the fact that I have an inept ability of managing time effectively or even at all	I don't quite know where to turn.  I just suffered through one of the most distracted weeks of my entire life.  I just lost my job of 2 years at the beginning of this month due to attendance issues.   <e1> Attendance issues </e1>  that were based  <e2> almost solely on the fact that I have an inept ability of managing time effectively or even at all </e2> .  As it stands right now, I have under 600 dollars in the bank with three very late bills and next months rent all looming in the immediate foreground.  My distractions have all but crippled my job searching ability and worst of all have caused me to miss my deadline to supply documentation for my Arizona unemployment insurance claim (which was on the 15th) meaning I will need to reenroll and wait through the entire process again.  I have no money to spare, but feel I've never needed professional help more in my life.  I just need some advice, some help, some guidance out of this pit that I've buried myself in.   I just need help. 
We	you.	We BOTH have PTSD from abusive relationships.  I have busted my ass trying to improve myself, and while I am empathetic I couldn't be in that situation any longer.  It was triggering me regularly, and I need to feel secure and like I am being heard.  I have been terrified to leave, but I seriously think I am okay.  I am not panicking, and my thoughts are not spiraling out of control.  Granted, I can't really sleep, but I'm processing things relatively normally? This is crazy for me! I am sad about the situation, but somewhat at peace, you know? Figured I would share my little success with you.  
Examples:you	it.	Examples:you don't have a problem, it's only when you drink hard liquor, etc etc.  I'm curious, it's harder for me to relate to that question now.  I want to say I actually believed the shit I was telling myself but I can't fathom how I could do that.  The background is that a close family member has been in three mental Institutes this year, lost their job, and had their throat close on them .  But yet they say none of it has to do with drinking or smoking.  It just got me thinking while your in it did it make sense to you?  Like your life shambling down around you but you hold on saying everything is normal.  Anyway I'm curious for anyone's thoughts on it.  As for me still sober and loving it. 
As	advice?	As odd as this is I am asking you guys for help, with how to ask people for help.   I am just about 4 months sober, I love my home group and I enjoy going to meetings but when it comes to asking for a sponsor or admitting I am having trouble I just can't bring myself to do it.   My mind totally shuts off, not only does it prevent me from asking anyone to be my sponsor but it has prevented me from telling my loved ones just how low I've gotten.   I have no doubt once I get a sponsor it will keep me from calling and telling him just how much trouble I am having.   Anyone with a similar problem and some advice?
said it was very important that I get the Watson (Actavis) brand	it's the only one that isn't terrible	I searched.  I swear. My doctor just prescribed me concerta, and  <e1> said it was very important that I get the Watson (Actavis) brand </e1> , because  <e2> it's the only one that isn't terrible </e2> .  No one has it.  Kremmer, Mallinckrodt, no Watson. Why did he recommend it? What's the difference? Should I track down this other stuff? Why do the pharmacists look at me funny when I ask what brand they have?
I	message.	I recently found that I am an addict, I've been watching Porn since the day I accidently stumbled upon it around age 10-12.  Ever since then it's been so hard for me to not go a month without it and as of recently I've came to a realization that it's been affecting my relationships and personal life and it's become part of my daily life.  I cannot sleep, I wake up with low energy and I feel tired and depressed all the time.  I don't remember the last time I've ever looked at someone in the eye and ever been this much lonely in my life.  I'm reaching out because I'm in need of help and I'm starting my no fap today to fight this drug addiction, it would have so much if you can help at least coach me a few words so that I can have someone to talk to or at least something good to look forward to during stopping this addiction process.  Thank you for taking your time of reading this message. 
I still feel positive emotions here and there	I feel somewhat confused	Hey there! Regular anxiety sufferer here, and I've been having extra unusual symptoms; being tired all the time, extra hungry, some suicidal thoughts, none of which I've ever had before.  That said,  <e1> I still feel positive emotions here and there </e1> , so  <e2> I feel somewhat confused </e2> . So I've been wondering, how do you make the difference between anxiety and depression, and/or other mental disorders?
I	own.	I am currently writing an essay about impulsivity and ADHD.  Does anyone care to share some things that they LIKE about their impulsive behaviour? This part of ADHD is often framed as bad, but I am trying to turn it around into positives.  I have a few but I am trying to include other peoples experiences, not just my own.  
I really struggle to come up with topics when I'm under pressure	I think it might have something to do with me being insecure about myself	I'm not proud of it, but every time someone talks shit about someone else I feel pressured to join in.  I have been trying really hard not to gossip or say bad things about other people behind their backs but  <e1> I really struggle to come up with topics when I'm under pressure </e1> .  <e2> I think it might have something to do with me being insecure about myself </e2>  too.  
Most of my friends are toxic	i usually stay at home	I don't know how to start thisI've thought about killing myself a lot.   i don't think i could do it but maybe i'm not there yet.   I have no feelings towards anything really.   I'm never sad angry or happy i feel like i'm just running on auto pilot.   <e1>  Most of my friends are toxic </e1>  so  <e2> i usually stay at home </e2> .   I don't believe in god, or i do just I don't think there's a god out there worrying about me.   And why should he i think about all the people who have it worst than me with cancer or any other illness.   I'm a healthy 19 yr old man who has no real reason to feel shitty every day.   i've thought about writing here for a few days but everyday i start i don't know  how to get my thoughts down.   I know i'm rambling and i guess all i really want is someone to tell me it gets better.   Thanks for taking the time to read this 
I	guys.	I used to be productive.  I used to have hobbies, a dream, and the will to see it all through.  Fuck, I used to be happy.  But some days, even on anti-depressants, that is too much to ask. What the fuck have I accomplished in the last two months.  What the fuck have I done for others in the past half year, or In the past year? Fuck all.  All I want in life is to make others happy and all I ask in return is for someone to be there for me.  There are people there for me.  But I don't deserve that shit.  I spend so much time on my ass on here, I have no time to return the damn favor. Fuck you, Reddit.  Goodbye /r/pics, /r/justneckbeardthings, /r/trashy, /r/cringepics and all the rest.  I'm done.  I'll be sticking around for one thing and one thing only; you guys and those on similar support subreddits.  You guys who need to talk and someone to listen.  That is what I want to do most in life.  Make others happy or at least bring them relief.  Anything to help. Thanks for being you.  I love you guys. 
I did 6 months on Adderall, and was getting Tachycardia.  Had to quit	I went natural for about a year	I'm 47 YO male.   <e1> I did 6 months on Adderall, and was getting Tachycardia.  Had to quit </e1> .  So  <e2> I went natural for about a year </e2> .  Then I started a low dose of Ritalin.  It was making me anxious, so I went back to natural (and forgetting everything).  Now I'm trying Vyvanse.  Two of my kids take Vyvanse, and it seems to work pretty well for them.  I'm worried it will give me the same symptoms as Adderall (tachycardia, high-ish blood pressure).  I am having trouble sleeping.  Both my boys reported the same thing - and eventually got used to it.  I could probably use less sleep. Has anyone else here had insomnia with Vyvanse?
I	this.	I have bipolar II and have been clinically depressed for years.  It comes and goes, but 6-9 months of every year I'm extremely sad.  I've been thinking about suicide a lot.  I've never had a romantic relationship, and not for lack of trying.  I'm unemployed and will have to start paying back huge student loans in about a month.  All I want to do all day is sleep.  When I'm asleep, I don't feel worthless or sad.  Things that were once joyful are a chore now.  My heart physically hurts.  I would much rather die than live like this. 
I just hate the thought of having a weird friendship clinging on by strands	I think both of us want to be friends again	I'm not going to type out the full story, as I am on mobile.  But I just feel like shit as usual every month for about two days.  I had a bestfriend and fucked it up with her, and ended up using a girl and then dumping her on New Years day because I didn't want to deal with her anymore.  But I don't feel bad about that, I still want to be friends with the girl I fucked up with, but I honestly don't know.  I'm going back to school in half a month and  <e1> I just hate the thought of having a weird friendship clinging on by strands </e1>  because  <e2> I think both of us want to be friends again </e2> .  I also have a hard time making new guy friends, and it's because I was abandoned my first bestfriend and my second vanished.  First one when I was 9, second when I was 15.  I'm almost 16 now.  Been clinically depressed since I was 9.  I'm also dealing with high functioning aspergers.  So it's a bit hard for me to make friends with people or sometimes talk to them. 
I	out?	I used to think about suicide all of the time, and then for the past year and a half or so I have fine, but suddenly all of my suicidal thoughts have flared up again big time over the last couple of days.  What do I do, do I just ride it out?
Very	lol	Very confused you know lol 
Mexico doesn't care much for mental health	they ust checked my body was okay and then sent me away	 <e1> Mexico doesn't care much for mental health </e1>  so  <e2> they ust checked my body was okay and then sent me away </e2> , but I'm stiill sad and suicidal any help?
I'm	message.	I'm certain that not everyone on this subreddit is like this.  But I'm a 15 year old struggling with severe ADHD, panic disorder, OCD and who knows what else.  Last night I spent around an hour working on a post, trying to perfectly and accurately describe the way that my new medicine was making me feel, and all that happened was that I got called a troll, downvoted and told to see a psychiatrist.  I asked for help, and I get told to go see a psychiatrist. This'll probably get downvoted again I'm sure, but I just hope at least someone one here with a heart can see this and get the message. 
Can't just do things without worry anymore - body is more aware of consequence	it doesn't recover as fast as it used to	For me personally, I started getting depressed near my 30s, and I know why.   Life got a lot slower.    <e1> Can't just do things without worry anymore - body is more aware of consequence </e1>  because  <e2> it doesn't recover as fast as it used to </e2> .   Spend almost all of my time at work or doing chores, when that's done I'm too tired to enjoy myself so really just sleep. Am old enough that I've seen friends die to illness, suicide, and random incidents (ie.  a drunk driver took one of my longtime friends out).   Have had the concept of love ruined by being in enough relationships to know it doesn't exist - have known people who've been screwed over in divorce which makes me even more hesitant to get involved with a woman. Overall, it now feels like life is nothing more than a struggle to stay out of debt and fight to slow the inevitable descent of health. 
I've	recommend?	I've been depressed since I was a small child and thought maybe this would be a place to just get things out and maybe express my feelings with the armor of anonymity.  If there is a better community, what do you recommend?
So	:D	So I've been underweight my whole life. . .  I'm a male, almost 18, 5'9 and before adderall I would float around 125-130.  But since I've started adderall my weight has been gradually decreasing.  I was shocked today when I checked my weight and it was 113. I have a meeting with my psychiatrist in a week and I'm wondering what the easiest way to get at least up to 120 would be.  What food/drink?I've been trying to eat but I feel so full and I'm still losing weight :( I really want to fix thisEdit: Thanks a lot for everyone posting, I wasn't expecting so many answers and I'm happy to read all the suggestions :D
Sleep is much better	I'm not getting up 3 times a night to pee	Appetite is down a bit, get full easily.  No complaints. No urge to drink, I've been going to coffee houses, but I prefer iced drinks, so I think I will stick to Tim Horton's, much cheaper than Starbucks <e1> Sleep is much better </e1> , especially since  <e2> I'm not getting up 3 times a night to pee </e2> . . . . So far, so good. 
I	less!	I made it to bed sober tonight! I even told my wife no when she asked if I wanted to go have a few.  She does not know the decisions I have to make about drinking or the internal struggles I have been going through lately.  But does comment when I am on a multi day bender.  I plan to open up to her soon.  Should have done it sooner but we are in the process of moving and going through some issues with our teenager.  So I am picking my time.  But I made it none the less!
It's	weeks.	It's officially been a full week (did I put the wrong date for my badge?). I had a pretty bad craving earlier.  But my husband, cloaked in the lingering odor of the one he just had, reminded me that last week I had said how fed up and miserable I felt all the time. What a wonderful guy. I hope I can help him too in a couple weeks. 
I've	time.	I've got a clock set to count my days, but I'm not going to make it about collecting days anymore.  I'm done and it doesn't really matter how long I've quit for if I'm really done.  Going to focus less on how far I've come because I feel like it becomes an excuse to slip up for me.  It's time to focus more on where I am every day, and deal with tomorrow when it gets here.  The good thing is, I'm not super tempted to go full relapse (at least not yet) like I was afraid of.  If nothing else, this month has taught me a lot that will help me quit for good this time.  
I	suck.	I can no longer imagine me being happy.  I can no longer imagine myself doing anything at all.  I waste slowly away.  I fucking hate myself.  I can't do anything.   I am probably not going to respond to anyone, I have a tendency to do so.  I am too fucking afraid of other people.  Even online. . .  I suck. 
Hello	out!	Hello all! I'm really hoping I can get some responses for this problem. . .   I have been smoking weed for about 2 years straight all day everyday.  I recently had a son and decided its time to throw in the towel.  The problem is I have appetite problems, I can't keep food down, can't eat if I can even find something that doesn't make me want to vomit. . .  I also have cold sweats and tremors.  So I am at the point where I know I want to be done but would detox be a better idea than cold turkey? Any and all advice is welcome.  Please help me out!
I have been having thoughts of using a gun to kill myself	I can't take this intense pressure anymore	I've been dealing with intense anxiety and it's eating me alive.   <e1> I have been having thoughts of using a gun to kill myself </e1> .   <e2> I can't take this intense pressure anymore </e2> . I called a local mental health helpline because I finally realized that I need some help.  The helpline I called is part of the mental health department in my city.  I called the helpline to ask about how I could get some help for my depression and suicidal thoughts.  The lady told me to come into their psychiatric emergency room.  I wanted to come in, but I'm very concerned about the cost of the emergency room.  I asked the lady about the cost, and she said When people are having a mental health crisis
I	before?	 I was a screw up for most of my life, however, I want to work hard, and turn myself around.  I have dreams of doing great things (becoming famous, becoming rich, etc) However, I feel like if I achieve any of those things, due to 25 years of nothing but failures and bad grades, that someone will think ive cheated to get there.  I want to do unprecedented things, and I feel like, if I do, since it doesnt really fit my past bio, i may be accused of doing something illegal/wrong to get there.  can someone explain why its wrong to think like thisBasically,Can someone who failed at everything, work hard, and become good at everything? without drawing suspicion? Wouldnt it be suspicious, just the fact that someone who did not work hard before is all of a sudden working hard?wouldnt it be suspicious that, someone who was once awkward is now socially presentable?wouldnt it be suspicious if someone made a total change, and is now doing better than people who looked down on him before?

I	suggestions?	I had to choose between the beautiful plant and the toxic hardcore opiate.   I have 56 8 mg left and i have already weaned myself down to 4 mg most days,  some days i cheat and take 6 or 8.   About to set up a taper schedule going something like 2 weeks 4mg 2 weeks 3, etc until i get down to less than half mg then doing a month on each of those steps.   Ive beat subs before by doing it this way.   Any suggestions?
Today	too.	Today I have been really depressed so I decided to write some affirmations for myself and found this:  google. co. uk/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=SjLkU8yhHsWw0QWfw4CIDg&amp;url= ocdrecoverycenters. com/library/ocd_article_slogans_sayings1. pdf&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAB&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5oF8DWhtWinwIatGmOlBRUDC_MA&amp;sig2=BUM_wMhncFStENDpcbiqMw   I decided to read and write down affirmations that stuck with me the most and after that I am feeling good about myself and secure about myself.  Especially the quote: houghts do not make reality and feelings aren't facts as I have an SO-OCD so knowing that my feelings aren't facts does help me out.  I also love the quote (paraphrasing) : see that it can be an opportunity to a greater spirituality and self discovery.  From my OCD I have discovered how compassionate of a person I am and discovered some elements of my life and discovered more about myself.  I know that this won't last but right now this has helped me out and I hope it helps anyone else here too. 
I've	boat.	I've had pretty bad physical anxiety issues for a while now.  I don't consider myself a nervous person, but I do constantly think about how I feel.  I've had a few full blown panic attacks, which have had a major lasting effect on me.  I find now, I almost look for reasons to find something wrong.  Some mornings, I'll wake up and feel great all day, and then others I'll wake up and I'll feel it.  Rapid heart beat, short of breath, weakness, dizzy, light headed (you know the drill).   I've been told to just try and work through it, but trying to do anything physical when you feel like you cannot breath isn't easy.  Any tips? Also no I am not on any meds.  My doctor suggested them, but I turned them down.  I opted to take an anxiety class, which has helped somewhat, but I'm still in the same boat.  
Hi	teens	Hi guys,Happened across this subreddit after looking online for things I can do to help my girlfriend.  She is severely depressed right now and suffers from bulimia and lately she's started to cut herself.  I can't say we are on the best of terms right now - in fact, we've been fighting, a lot.  When we do fight (and sometimes even when we don't) she will lock herself in the bathroom and either throw up, or cut herself.  I'm really not sure what to do anymore.  I've tried looking into /r/SuicideWatch because she has been mentioning suicide recently, so I'm going to try to watch what I say to her and how I interact with her so I don't do anything that might rigger an attack.  She's confided in me before that she used to cut when she was much younger (in her early teens
I	place	I haven't been to my doc in a while, a long while. . . this happened in 2012, I never really looked into the internet much about it, I just had the info my doc told me and well, at the time, I thought it was pretty accurate. . . but now I'm not so surePeople here mention that BPD usually involves lying, denial, hurting other people, stuff like that. . . and well, I think I've always been more drawn to hurting myself overthinking and putting myself in this states of mind, rather than doing so with anyone else, so, what do you guys think? do you have some links where I can look into this before deciding going back to the doc? thank you, I'm happy I found this place
we started doing EMDR	feel pretty relaxing	Today was my second session with a therapist, and  <e1> we started doing EMDR </e1> .  It did  <e2> feel pretty relaxing </e2> , but I'm just curious if anyone here has tried it and had long lasting results.  
I	this	I don't know if this is the right place to post here or not.  first of all, don't panic, although i'm having the thoughts i'm not willing to put them in actionGenerally i wouldn't call myself clinically depressed, I'm willing and eager to live but I've been in tough time in life for more than 3 years now.  and it doesn't seem its going to get better anytime soon. One day I'm highly hopeful and ambitious, the other I'm emitting depression, my problem is the suicidal thoughts, if i think more about my problems even in positive way is when these thoughts hunt me really hard, its like I can't think of anything else but suicide. When i'm at better spot I try to cheer myself up by saying see if you did it you wouldn't have enjoyed this 
I	it.	I just started taking Ritalin (immediate-release), 5 mg twice per day.  I'm trying to figure out how cautious I need to be with alcohol before the weekend starts.  I don't drink often, and when I do, it's rarely more than 2 or 3 drinks in an evening.  I also don't take the 2nd dose later than 3PM, so I'm wondering if it's even still in my system in the evening to interact with the alcohol at all. EDIT: If anyone could link to some good information about this, too, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
I've	sucks.	I've noticed that I really only fight my depression when my life is taking a turn for the worse, then when my life is going great it's like I give in to it. For example right now I should be really happy because I've gotten into a school I had almost zero chances of getting into because I missed qualification but they wrote it off and let me in.  I've also worked and saved up a lot of money for the next school year so that I can live of more than noodles.  But the last week it's just been getting worse and worse no matter what I do, atleast I managed to get my ass to work this last week. This just sucks. 
I	Crap.	I hate that I'm constantly distracted and not paying attention to what I'm doing.  I need to be vigilant that I'm not doing something idiotic, but I'm too scatterbrained to even imagine that will ever happen.  Just now I was carrying many things.  I threw them on my bed so I could go brush my teeth.  My phone, my tablet, my purse, my clothes for tomorrow, the full glass of water I was holding, my. . .  Crap. 
Howdy	point?	Howdy folks.  A little back story about me here- I graduated from college a year ago.  Got my BFA.  Not the best major one could ever take on, but also not the worst.  I made a shit show of my senior project, which was perhaps too ambitious of an undertaking, but I also had a fun year and made a lot of friends, so it balanced out. It's been over a year, I'm still unemployed. This whole summer has been long stretches of inactivity followed by occasional bursts of almost manic productivity.  All summer, I've been blaming my ADHD for my inability to get a job, for my inability to pursue other projects, or keep my room clean, or go to bed on time.  But it's just occurred to me that ADHD may not be the main culprit at this time. In school, while I wasn't a steam powered machine or a working dynamo, I got things done.  I got things done, then was still able to pursue separate interests that required some work.  But the question I've been asking myself all summer, consciously or not, has been what is the point?
Holding down my job is becoming more and more difficult	its slowly killing me	All the time.  All.  The.  Time. I'm tired of this too shall pass.  Please allow me to spill everything to you.  I do apologize for the length; I was a creative writing turned English literature major.  Just what happens. But here's this:tl;dr:  <e1> Holding down my job is becoming more and more difficult </e1>  by the day and  <e2> its slowly killing me </e2> . For years
So	this?	So I found a game I might be interested in getting but I don't have the money.  I'm honestly not that bothered about it (it would just be cool to mess around with) but my brain is just like NEW THING! GET IT! GETTT ITTTT! Sell something on ebay and GET ITTT!. All the while I have this anxious feeling and this relentless bullshit in the back of my mind like some spoiled little 3 year old that wants chocolate and won't stfu until it gets it.  I sometimes feel like a drug addict wanting a fix or something. Anyone else experience anything like this?
Switching	Thanks!!	Switching from Risperdal to Latuda seemed like a great idea in my psychiatrist's office this morning.   Tonight, though, I'm kinda freaking out.   I have a significant problem with mixed episodes.   I know Latuda is touted for bipolar depression.   Does anyone know of effects on manic or mixed symptoms?  The information I'm finding via searching the Web is either entirely about bipolar depression or conflicting in terms of mania/mixed episodes.   Thanks!!
I a worried	telling my doctors about opiate abuse will greatly reduce me in their eyes	I am going to see my physician today after the police found me nodded out in my vehicle, parked in a parking lot and determined that I needed an ambulance ride to the ER.  My doctors office called me asking me to bring all the documents in that the ER gave me as they could not get a hold of them.  I suppose I am just a little skeptical that this is going to fuck with my insurance, or possibly make me not eligible for life insurance further down the road as I am 25.  Should I just tell my PCP or NP everything? Should I withhold certain things? I have tapered down my use since the incident and am no longer dependent.  But  <e1> I a worried </e1>  that  <e2> telling my doctors about opiate abuse will greatly reduce me in their eyes </e2>  and that is not something I want to happen in case I get sick or injured down the road. Any advice would be wonderful. 
As	person?**	As an adult I've come to terms with the harm my ADD has caused to my loved ones in the past and made ammends.  This isn't about self pity or guilt.     There are volumes of studies showing the pervasive negative impact on Quality of Life Measurements on Adults with ADD and there significant others and families.  It's less like causing black or white, clear cut injury so much as constantly emiting harmful low level radiation.    With adaptive behaviours and such I've made a nice little life without causing a whole lot of havok and hurt to anyone else, as long our relationship doesn't get too intimate or informal. **TL;DR Is there's skills and tools that exist that so a close relationship with someone with ADD is no more harful than with a normal person?**     
My pharmacy switched up their generic adderall to corepharma	it gives me horrible headaches	 <e1> My pharmacy switched up their generic adderall to corepharma </e1>  and  <e2> it gives me horrible headaches </e2> , I tried to call around to find if any other pharmacies carried other brand generics and I've never been treated so shit before in my life.  As soon as I mention adderall I can hear the tone in their voice change.  Walmart flat out told me they can't disclose that information over the phone(?!).  I'm pretty sure a few of them made up lies on the phone to get me off(one said they carried it at first, when I inquired she then changed her story to we're almost out followed by the person who orders the prescriptions isn't in and we don't know when she's coming back).  out of 7 pharmacies I called only _one_ was able to provide me with info who was also extremely helpful and explained that the fillers could definitely be causing the headaches
Thinking	sobriety	Thinking about it my most weak times are and were weekends, not going to work, peer drinkers available, lack of emotional companionship (we in  general are socio-emotional critters), 'need to relax' excuse etc etc , amAny way evenings should be orange alert and weekends red, rest yellow, there is nothing like green rest of our lives fellas. . . . . like someone here said plan sobriety to the end ie grave and hopefully it will be blissfully long happy fruitful sobriety 
As	conversation	As the post title suggests, I'm a 24 year old adult male.  I've long wondered if i have some form of ADHD.  I know that its impossible for me to diagnosis myself, but I seem to be exhibiting a variety of symptoms from both the inattentive and hyperactive sides.  I used to be a manager for a business, but couldn't hold onto my job because I'd make the same stupid mistakes over and over, couldn't remember how to do certain things, etc.  I also had a great deal of trouble with college, despite being very interested in my major and having great instructors.  I'm disorganized and had a lot of difficulty when it came to projects, papers and whatnot.  Mostly, I'd miss key info in class because i just. . . wasn't there a lot of the time.  I'd just zone out without even realizing it.  Sometimes I wouldn't even be thinking about anything in particular just like for lack of a better way of putting it wasn't there.  A lot of times I find myself doing the same thing in conversation
I	else.	I posted here a couple days ago but no replies.     Went to the ER the next day.  Sent home on more waitlists.     I don't want to kill myself.  I'm aware of how much pain I would cause.     I'm afraid of myself.  I know I'm going to do it.  I don't know what to do anymore.  I've tried everything else. 
Recently	world?	Recently found this sub, and it has been rather informative.  Especially seeing people's posts and realizing how much I have in common with a lot of you.  I have not been diagnosed with ADHD although I will be setting up an appointment shortly.  I do have a question though.  Does anybody happen to stare at the ground while walking? Not because of low self esteem or whatever the case may be, but simply to limit the amount of input you are receiving from the world?
Hey	tired	Hey guys, just because im really curious how many symptoms I share with your average ADHD-PI subtype, would you mind answering a few questions? I will answer my own questions. This thread is not meant to be rigorous or scientific, just a sharing of common symptoms.  I would like to avoid debates over the subtypes, and comments of hat's just laziness or my adhd doesn't make me who I am nature. 1.  Are you overweight?2.  Could you be classified as heavily lazy?3.  Do you feel tired
I've avoided counseling and any type of diagnosis for years	the stigma associated with mental illness	Well, I made my intake appointment with the campus counseling center for next week.  I'm unsure of what to say to convey what is going on without sounding like an attention seeker or someone going in hoping for a diagnosis.  I know that looking back on my patterns, I possibly have bp 2 or something similar, but when I think about laying out the facts for a counselor, it almost sounds like I'm just saying things needed to get a diagnosis, which is not the case.   <e1> I've avoided counseling and any type of diagnosis for years </e1>  because of  <e2> the stigma associated with mental illness </e2> , but I need to get my moods under control now so that I can graduate.  Basically, I'm just nervous about the appointment.  I've done a few sessions twice before but chickened out of anything long enough to lead to diagnosis.  This time I'm going to try to stick it out. 
I finally found one that works for me	I feel great	So I just got diagnosed last year, and I'm 24 years old.  After juggling around with a few different medications  <e1> I finally found one that works for me </e1> , and  <e2> I feel great </e2> ! I function so much better and I'm beginning to see the best version of myself come out.  However, because I was diagnosed later in life I've basically spent my entire life putting myself doing because of my shortcomings.  I consistently thought I was stupid, lazy, and socially awkward without knowing what the actual issue was.  I'm just now beginning to realize the great things about me, even after years of bashing myself.  I'm sure there's a few of you on this sub that have had a similar experience, if so how did you deal with this? I'm trying to tell myself that I'm smart, capable, and have a lot to offer but I still struggle.  Coworkers consistently tell me how smart I am and it's almost like I don't believe them because I spent so long thinking something was wrong with me, even though I AM intelligent. I'm trying my best, but any advice would be wonderful. 
Hello,	sounds.	Hello, I'm new here and I'd just like to share some of my usual day. Today I woke up with my ex-girlfriend lying down by my side, she was naked with her body covered in blood, I can still see some blood on my sheet.  She always tell me that everything will be all right when I join her, she shows me knives in my desk.  I try to sleep more. I went to my PC and try to message my ex-girlfriend, but she never answer. . .  I killed her.  People keep telling me that she's alive but then why does she keep appearing here?Voices in my head tell me to draw things, I drew a dead woman today and put it on my wall.  After some time she started talking to me and I end up punching the wall.  I broke one of my fingers. I hear strange sounds, I sent some records to a friend, some had the sounds I heard and some didn't, the only ones she heard any sounds were the ones that I send without sounds. 
But	person	But I did not.  I must admit, it smelled awesome.  But I chose the awesome feeling of waking up refreshed and revitalized over the borrowed relaxation of a few rum and cokes.  I had a great sleep on 0. 25 mg (decreased from 0. 5) of Clonazepam and 2 allergy pills.  Woke up a but groggy as I normally only take 1. 5 allergy pills, but still a billion times better than if I'd drank to pass out. Reflection of the day. . . - THE WHYI have been reflecting a lot on the why behind my drinking.  I can't say I'm a particularly depressed person
My awkward personality	alienated most of my coworkers and managers	I've been feeling very down lately.  My life seems to be falling apart.  Just a year ago it seemed I had everything figured out.  Almost a year ago today I landed a great job with a great company, but now it's all gone to shit.  I've lost all confidence in myself and my abilities at my job, the prospects of being offered a full time position are laughable.   <e1> My awkward personality </e1>  has  <e2> alienated most of my coworkers and managers </e2> .  Relationships with any of them are unsalvageable.  I got offered a great opportunity and I fucked it up! I'll never get a good reference now, I'm ruined.  I'm a joke and slave to my emotions.  I can't stand the thought of being unemployed again.  The world would certainly not miss me.  
I	Well	I don't know what the point of my life is.  I don't know what to even write here.  I don't know anything.  Looking at myself compared to a few years ago, I feel I've made progress.  I've had new experiences.  Acquired new skills.  I've become a little less bad at talking to people.  I've even managed to make a few friends here and there. I feel alone.  I feel worthless.  I wish I could matter to somebody, but I just can't see any reason why anyone should care about me.  I don't have anything to offer this world.  I've received advice before about dealing with loneliness.  Let's see. Do what makes you happy and don't worry about other people.  I do.  I've spent thousands of hours of my life doing things that make me happy.  Alone.  Is it so fucking crazy to wish to be able to do things with other people? If a guy is stranded on a desert island for 20 years would you tell him he shouldn't feel lonely because he needs to just focus on what makes him happy? Well
I get extremely nervous	meeting people and socializing in public areas like cafes (the scariest)	If you have read T. S Eliot's The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock then this best describes me.  Although I'm intelligent, fit, good looking and surprisingly well liked in a great group of friends  <e1> I get extremely nervous </e1>   <e2> meeting people and socializing in public areas like cafes (the scariest) </e2> .  I analyse things way too much and am aware of this but like Prufrock can't just let it go.  Please Help.  
I can't help to think that I don't deserve him	He's so considerate.  I'm just depressed and shitty	I'm 17, and currently dating my first bf.  we've only been together about 2 months now.  He is probably the sweetest thing ever.  He doesn't pressure me to do anything.  He's open minded and I always have fun when I'm with him.  I told him about my depression last night and he was completely accepting of it.  He wakes up every morning and sends me a good morning text (I'm in hs, he graduated).  He always tells me how awesome I am.  <e1> I can't help to think that I don't deserve him </e1> .   <e2> He's so considerate.  I'm just depressed and shitty </e2> . 
Anyone	future.	Anyone have any tips on how to calm down my anxiety? I'm currently sitting in my room torturing myself with sad music while I convince myself that I have no future.  
**TLDR	does**	**TLDR Suggest awesome things you have found with learning more about ADHD**  Do not be shy, do not be afraid to just post, even if I already have it I don't care I want more stuff. I am working on a personal blog [ blogspot. com/]( blogspot. com/)My plan for the blog is to be an index of helpful ADHD resources from everywhere to * websites,* pdfs,* powerpoints,* video lectures (1 hour plus),* **short video clips** (2 to 5 minutes) explaining ADHD,* books,* etc. In effect to be a resource for new people with ADHD and for parents with ADHD kids etc.   Effectively being an index or what used to be a webring. In sum everything----I would greatly appreciate suggested content as well as people double checking what I posted works okay and such. Also any advice on blogging and raising my search profile will be helpful. ----**Thank for helping with this request****Thankful for everything this reddit does**
**Update:**	bit	**Update:** Slept 11 hours last night.  I feel like I won the lottery. I've had anxiety issues for a while, but never like this. I just got back from a trip to my father-in-law's cabin for the weekend.  I haven't slept since I got out of bed Friday morning.  It's now Sunday afternoon.  I felt fine when I got to the cabin Friday evening.  I went to bed around 10 p. m. , but never fell asleep.  My brain went insane all night long, with multiple anxiety attacks, and I was stuck in a rut of obsessive thoughts I did not enjoy, including suicidal ones, and a lot of just plain weird ones.  I remember thinking frequently throughout the night What the hell is going on? I don't care about these things? Why am I panicking about them? I got up the next morning groggy.  We went out goose hunting for a bit
So	do.	So just 2 days ago my friend suggested some of us go to the zoo.  I was excited at first.  I hadn't been to the zoo in a long time and I've been wanting to go for a while.  But now that we're leaving tomorrow morning my anxiety has overtaken me and I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack.  I want to cut and run.  I don't know what would be worse.  Feeling awful and still going and risk breaking down in front of everyone, or not going and regretting it.  I just feel so, so afraid.  I'm trying not to cry and scream.  I don't know what to do.  
I'm	again.	I'm in west LA, and I gotta stop.  I need meetings or something.  can someone help me? I just want this to end.  I dont wanna feel so sad anymore.  I wanna feel in control again.  
Does	way.	Does anyone else feel as though they lose large amounts of time to being depressed? I literally have no idea where the summer went, or what I've been doing for the past several months.  Nothing stands out in my memory.  Just work and home, and perpetual sadness.  Now the trees are changing, and I know winter will be here soon, which is usually the worst time for me.  I'm not usually depressed this bad in the summer months.  It seems to be getting much worse as I get older - I was hoping it would be the opposite way. 
Going out around people	me feel anxious	I've been feeling overwhelmed by everything lately.   <e1> Going out around people </e1>  makes  <e2> me feel anxious </e2> .  The friends I do have are vapid personalities.  They don't care about me and I don't care about them but we can take up space for each other.  Some days that's all I need to survive the creeping loneliness but today is not one of those days.  I don't know how much longer I can fight this depression. . .  I just want all of this to stop. . .  finally stop. 
I	it.	I haven't been in school in about 6 years.  I start official classes Friday but the orientation is tomorrow, there's a gathering with the faculty and then there is a free BBQ where you're supposed to mingle with everybody.  Well, I'm afraid of mingling! I suck at mingling, I shake and get all awkward and just end up standing in the corner and then everybody think's I'm the weird girl or a bitch.  I don't have any friends IRL, I literally don't (every friend I ever have has fucked me over), so it would be nice to be able to make friends, but I just can't.  Not really sure how to handle it. 
hey	you.	hey i'm sorry.  i don't feel suicidal but i need someone to talk to on the phone and the suicide hotline is the first thing that popped into my mind.  is there a number to call where i can just talk things out? thank you.  
My	this?	My parents are gone for the weekend, so I was thinking about what I was gonna do for dinner for a few days.  I got the random urge to make my own breadcrumbs to make breaded chicken tonight.  I was just sitting on Reddit as usual, and next thing I know I'm down in the kitchen breaking bread into pieces.  Seems pretty normal, but this is coming from someone who normally DESPISES cooking.  Like, my usual idea of cooking is throwing a frozen meal in the microwave or if I'm lucky boiling water for pasta.  I would always avoid it, and now here I am making some bangin' breaded chicken tenders for dinner.  Who am I??Does anyone else have any funny/interesting experiences like this?
I am starting to become concerned	I am only happy when I am drinking	I am not sure, if this should be posted here or not but I figure what the hey.  I have recently been going through some depression, rejection and anxiety problems.  For the past couple of month I will drink every Friday and sometimes on Saturday as well.  I don't get totally shit faced or anything.  <e1> I am starting to become concerned </e1> because  <e2> I am only happy when I am drinking </e2> . . . the other days of the weeks I am completely miserable and just want to roll over and die.  I don't think I am becoming a full blown alcoholic but I am concerned this is early warning signs of one.  
I'm	anxious.	I'm just curious as what kind of thoughts are produced when feeling anxious.  
I have been suffering from depression for the last couple years	Had suicidal thougths	 <e1> I have been suffering from depression for the last couple years </e1> .    <e2> Had suicidal thougths </e2>  but nothing I could not handle or talk sense into me.  In a couple of weeks I know I am going to get bad news( rejected from the job of my dreams and breaking up, there is nothing I can do about it) any tips on how to approach the situation so I do not take any rush decision I could regret. 
The	y'all.	The feeling of liking a girl.  The feeling of sexual desire.  The feeling of having a fun conversation with someone.  The feeling of being spontaneous.  The simple feeling of walking down the sidewalk on a nice day.  It is all gone. I was watching this tv show where the husband and his wife have this great romantic moment and I just think that it has been so long since I really had strong feelings for any single person.  Even my own family I am just completely ambivalent towards.  I have no personality anymore.  I don't have fun doing anything.  It blows and I have no idea why I feel this way.  What did I do to deserve any of this.  I used to be a  passionate guy, I used to be quirky and now I don't have a soul.  If this resonates at all with you, please leave a comment or message me. Peace and love, y'all. 
My	problems?	My girlfriend successfully recovered from bulimia.  (praises all around) however, now when she is sick, she says her body will not puke.  She has to do it herself, or she is miserable for days.  also, she drools a lot, her saliva glands are way more active than they used to be.  Are these side effects normal? should I expect any more? is there any way to help her with these problems?
Dont	it	Dont let yourself think you're of any less value because of other people.  Dont compare yourself to others, you aren't them! You're you, and you is everything you need to be.  Even if you arent good at certain things.  You dont need to be! Do what you enjoy because you enjoy it
I	warning.	I was bored yesterday afternoon and I reverted to some old behaviors: sexual self gratification.  I was fantasizing about my wife, but I was watching a television show that contains some amount of sexual content.  While I would immediately cease when something sexual was on screen and would only think of my wife, afterwards I still felt icky because I feel like lines were definitely starting to blur a little and this is the type of stuff I would do before looking at some P.  I guess the lesson here is that I took note of the warning signs telling me this is a behavior I shouldn't repeat as it could send me down a bad road.  If you engage in behavior that reminds you or makes you want P, listen to your warning.  
So	Cancer	So I have been lurking for a while working up the courage to quit and finally took the plunge.  I woke up yesterday with 3 smokes left and decided I wasn't going to the store for more.  The cravings are rough, but so far I've come up with a pretty good list of things that they are better than. My Cravings are better than;* Fighting with my wife* Spending thousands of dollars on smokes. * Dying of cancer* Smelling like shit 24/7* Yellow Teeth* Not seeing my kids grow upWhen it comes down to it, I know I'm stronger than the nic fit.  And thats about it. Fuck Cancer
About	best.	About a month ago, I moved away from home for university, and I have become a completely different person.  I feel happy again, and even times when I would otherwise feel down, like when I have nothing to do and time to dwell and think, I still feel happy.  It's amazing what getting away from city life can do for you.   I may have been a lurker and a never-poster, but it was good to know there were others who felt as I did.  I wish you all the best. 
I	Williamstown	I can recall that even as a small child I had allergic reactions to certain forms of reality. Williamstown

Yeah	not?:(	Yeah so I came across this site while looking for tips on pain free ways to end it all.  I know we all have problems but mine are what seem to me, insurmountable.  I can't do this alone and that's exactly what I am and have always been. I'm so tired of this miserable life. Yes I have a therapist and he's good.  But he can't live my life for me.  And plus when I tell him how I feel, he kind of dumbs it down a bit, like its not a big deal.  If ending my life is no big to my therapist, why should I think it's a big deal? The writing is clearly on the wall, is it not?:(
So	this	So I should have handed in a short paper of 500 words about an hour ago which is a requirement to take part in the test in a few weeks.  I tried to start on it sunday and monday evening with every file I needed open on my laptop, but I just had such a strong brain fog.  I got mad at myself continuously: If you are not going to do this
He ripped the door off of the hinges	his headphones broke	Hey all, I am looking for any insight into Strattera.  My nearly14 year old son has been on Strattera for almost 4 months, with a dose increase just a month ago.  Over the last week he has been enraged with anything and everything.   <e1> He ripped the door off of the hinges </e1>  because  <e2> his headphones broke </e2> .  This is not normal for him, impulsive yes, he has never had episodes of  enrage like this. I am wondering if anyone knows of, or has experienced anything like this.  I have read some negative reviews, but nothing like what we are dealing with here.  Any insight/advice is more than appreciated.

Any suggestions on some easy foods to eat? Like smoothies etc.  Note that I am a vegetarian. rrEdit: If it helps, I am on 20mg Adderall twice a day.  Thanks!
I	this?	I was just wondering if anybody had experience here.  I have many symptoms of Bipolar 2, but I didn't notice them until after I started taking Adderall.  But now I can't tell if the symptoms are Adderall abuse side effects or Bipolar.  Or maybe I developed the addiction because of the Bipolar.  Didn't have either until I was 25.   I'm not looking for medical advice and I am working with my doctor.  I was just curious if anybody has a reference point with this? 
Whoa,	help.	Whoa, I've realized how not so cool this is.  I've recently purchased and shared online internet porn on xhamster and pornhub.  You guys will probably look down on me for this.  But I could use some help.  
I	go?	I (24F) was diagnosed with BPD around six weeks ago after a long battle with depression, self-harm, suicide attempts and other manic behaviour.  My symptoms have got worse since my mom died last year, so my GP finally referred me to a psychiatrist after years of knowing something else was wrong with me in my heart. As I say, my mom died last year.  My dad died eight years ago.  All this time I've had this idealised image of my parents since their death, but after counselling had me delving into my childhood and the psychiatrist pointed out my mom as a trigger point, I have come to realise that my parents didn't validate my feelings as I grew up.  They were selfish sometimes, often ignoring my own anger and misery that I struggled with, and never let me be me. I'm struggling with the reality over the dream.  My parents were my everything and now it feels like they broke me, and have left me here broken.  Every day is a struggle.  I have nightmares of them, I stopped grieving and instead I'm carrying around all this anger and rejection. How do I let it go?
I have a hard time trusting people	I myself am untrustworthy	 <e1> I have a hard time trusting people </e1> .   My ex says this is because  <e2> I myself am untrustworthy </e2> .   Like today, a man I am interested in told me yesterday he will be somewhere that gets shitty cell phone reception.   I got one text from him.   I called him a little bit ago and it went to voicemail.   So now I am worried he just doesn't want to talk to me.   It's crazy because he wants to see me tomorrow and has never lied to me.   Gotta love bpd insecurity. 
i sat at my friend house crying	i was having a panic attack	4 months ago was my birthday and  <e1> i sat at my friend house crying </e1>  because  <e2> i was having a panic attack </e2>  as i was going bowling.  Today I went to a tai chi lesson and for a check up at the dentist (something i'd been avoiding for almost a year) This morning i woke up 2 hours earlier then i needed to because i was having a panic attack so that sucked but i carried on regardless and tomorrow i'm starting a tai chi class but that's tomorrow so i'm not going to start worry about that until later this evening.  I just wanted to get it off my chest, i'm on a bit of a high right now.  Most other people would think i'm stupid for feeling proud for going to appointments.  
I	myself	I was started on adderall 15mg 2x a day and after a month increased to 25mg 2x a day.  The one thing that really stood out for me is how honest I have become.  If someone asked me, did you get that? I'm not afraid to say no and ask for clarification.  Also I feel like I don't have to lie as much to get through the day. In a way I have enjoyed this new found honesty.  Not only being honest with myself
I'm	cancer.	I'm not overweight, I exercise a lot, but I'm concerned with how it could hit me later if I keep eating this way and that it could give me cancer. 
I've	emotional	I've been getting better at keeping myself in check lately.  I'll think about something that makes me angry, but then I can calm myself down and return to normal.  Occasionally though, my wife sees me in the first stage, and she'll say something about me getting angry.  Usually it's something that can't be fixed right now, so I tell her not to worry.  That never works, so she starts acting all defensive around me.  Sometimes I slip over the edge when that happens and get really mad.  I know that it's stupid, but at the time I can't get over it. A few times I try telling her what I'm starting to get mad at, and it's usually something silly, which makes it easier to calm down, but then she starts getting mad at me for getting mad at whatever it is.  A few times she's told me that she wants to be able to be the girl and be emotional
Sup.	usual.	Sup. Never posted here.  So I've had these issues for a long long time.  have come up with various strategies, and had lots of success as of late.  But then I get all insecure (without reason) and backslide into my head and just assume its all going to crash.  Arg.  Just hiding in my house, on reddit, you know the usual.  
How	boss	How they do it in japan they get a hello kitty doll or pikachu doll and say thats you - you are so pretty - you are so nice; you can make them pure with your energy if its real.   Japan also has very nice parades, temples, and traditionsAsian countries: Leave your favorite food as an offering outside for your ancestorsJewish culture: sacrifice one goat per year as an offering to godIndia:  Indians worship a temple with rats, and leave them gifts daily, feed and clean them alsoBeen there myself - I was a macho a**hole and when they were watching me I threatened them and said I would fight them.  Finally getting better but not fixed all the way.  Native american: Dancing, Shamans, PeacePipe (my favorite), body artMy advice is to tell you to do your favorite things, music or whatever as much as he can.  Always have the attitude of I love everything.  Dont fight them - just talk like a man to a woman (shes a girl!); be calm and assertive; you can try I'm the boss
I	me?	I don't really know how I see this situation, but I'll just let it out. I am quite certain that tonight, only 1 hour ago, I tried to commit suicide.  It was admittedly a half-assed attempt, but an attempt nonetheless.  I had two plastic bags (one inside the other), and taped them over my head.  I lay down on my bed for about 10 minutes with the hopes of passing out.  I thought about my life, and my family.  I am quite young (24) and have resigned myself to a life of failure and misfortune.  My arms and legs began to feel a little numb, and I was quite relaxed.  I don't know exactly why, but eventually I decided to get up and remove the bags.  I then had a shower and my mood has somewhat normalised. I don't know if this was really 'my' depression, or whether it was just a reaction to SSRI withdrawal.  I took 10mg Lexapro for 8 days, and today was my 2nd day without.  I now have a minor headache. What the heck just happened to me?
I	music	 I didn't knew where else to type this, but I thought here it would be appropriate.   I feel a bit embarrassed by even writing this, but yesterday and briefly today, I experienced this weird sensation while listening to music.  It was as my negative thoughts stopped, like my mind was racing on pleasant thoughts yet it was as if I was not thinking about anything, but I remember thinking of positive things.  I felt this overwhelming rush of euphoria, and it felt really good.  It was a weird experience, but it made me feel great for those little minutes.  Sometimes I get this rush or overwhelming feeling while listening to music
Stopped	stoned.	Stopped smoking about a year a go.   I honestly don't remember the date I last smoked, but it was either October or November.  I was looking for a job, so I quit (I was a daily smoker for about 5 years).   I have a job now, but I'm not that happy with it and looking for another.   Technically, I could smoke without getting fired since they don't test, but I'd like to keep looking for jobs.   I just need some encouraging words if anyone could spare some.   I'm tired of drinking.   I wanna get stoned. 
Not	GPA	Not sure why I am writing this post but I just wanted to put a pencil to paper (metaphorically of course) and get some of these ideas down.  I am feeling like shit today and hopefully this can inspire some of you to join me on the road to getting better. I'm sick and tired of feeling this way.  I am going to beat this thing - and I invite you all to join me.  I have had this thing beaten before and now it has slipped back into my life and is beginning to take over again. I have been depressed despite having everything going for me.  During college I graduated with a 4. 0 GPA
I'm not sure how to just get my words out	I get really self concious	I can be thinking all these positive things, very calmm minded, and then someone asks me how I am and I just go 'mmmokthajg' or something like that.  It's quite embarrassing and people look a little confused and sometimes offended.   <e1> I'm not sure how to just get my words out </e1> ,  <e2> I get really self concious </e2>  like it hurts even just having them look at me.  Any tips? 
After	ums	After a nine week regime of lexapro to combat anxiety and depression, gradually escalating to 15mg, my psychiatrist finally felt confident enough to prescribe me ritalin IR at 10mg. I took my lexapro three hours ago, and ritalin half an hour later.  This is how I feel so far:* I can sit still-for example, at a bus stop-without drumming my fingers or being fidgety. * I'm walking at a much quicker pace now, and not getting distracted or fidgety (e. g.  pulling and crushing leaves from trees)* I had conversations on people with the bus without even thinking about it.  I was talking quickly, but I knew exactly what I was going to say.  I didn't have as many ums
I	antidepressants?	I was on 50mg sertraline for about two years but stopped for the past 4 months.  I just got back on it today and took a half dose (25mg) about 5 hours ago.  I'm starting to feel a numb/tingly feeling in my face similar to the lead up of an anxiety attack or being drunk.  However, I'm not anxious and am completely sober.  Has anyone else experience this feeling getting back on/just starting antidepressants? 
I've	this.	I've been a redditor for over a year now, but something just a few minutes ago convinced me to be honest with myself and make this account.  A little background on me:I'm a 17 year old guy living in New England.  I am gay, bi, or somewhere in between, though stuck in the closet.  I am in love with my friend, who does not know I know he is bi.  I've had suicidal thoughts nearly every week at minimum for the past nine years, and have had self-harm issues for the last five years.  That stopped four years ago, but I fell back into it this summer. Tonight, I was trying to sum up the courage to tell my friend how I feel about him when my emotions caught up with me.  To skip to the point, ten minutes ago, I found myself with a blade in my hand, ready to end things before breaking down and realizing just how fucked up I am mentally.  I stopped myself tonight, but I don't know if that'll happen the next time I get like this. 
lately a lot of people have dipped out of my personal life	my self esteem has taken a big hit	This is so frustrating.  I don't know what happened.  I guess I took one look, panicked because I didn't know who was who or where the group was, and backed out.  I can be really confident and forward sometimes but  <e1> lately a lot of people have dipped out of my personal life </e1>  and  <e2> my self esteem has taken a big hit </e2> .  I don't exactly want to spend the rest of my life as a loner but I don't know how to change it at this point.  I'm also not even sure if I'm introverted or if I want to be social and am barred by my SA.  I like spending time with myself, and I prefer hanging out in small groups over large ones, but it just gets lonely sometimes.  I feel that I have been so neurotic lately in particular that maybe it would be good to just be alone and not attempt to meet new people right now.  I often wonder if people can tell that there is something 'off' about me.  Or maybe that's just the anxiety speaking. 
I find it difficult understanding anything while listening and writing	I started recording the lectures	So I recently started university again, after a 2-year break (because of mental health, ADHD reasons). * Our lectures are mostly writing down what's being written on the black board, while the professor continuously speaks.   <e1> I find it difficult understanding anything while listening and writing </e1> .  <e2> I started recording the lectures </e2> , so I can go through it in my own time.  Not that I have done it or found the time to do so =/* Regarding studying.  Obviously related to my long break, it's just so hard. . . For the moment motivation and concentration (new on Ritalin) is not the problem.  It's just retaining information.  Even if I understand something more difficult after after a while.  It's likely I won't remember the mental step I did to understand that specific problem the next day.   **TL;DR How do I make the most out of lectures.  Advice on studying appreciated. **
I	done.	I have been very down for the past couple of years, and when I would wake up each morning and think I would never make it out of bed, my dog would jump up tail wagging and eyes bright then proceed to pester me to walk her until I got up and got moving.  A constant source of affection and friendship.  She was the last little ray of sunshine in my life.  And now it's been put out.  I'm staying in bed from now on.  I'm done. 
So,	again.	So, like most other people making posts like this, I want to kill myself. Unfortunately, I can't pin it to a specific reason or reasons.  I mean, if I wanted to I could sit down and come up with a list.  I'm unemployed, I'm facing homelessness, I'm alone.  But even when I had a job, when I had a place to live, when I had someone to connect with, I still wanted to kill myself.  I've been feeling this way for over ten years.  The constant, nagging urge in the back of my mind to just off myself.  Daily thoughts that it'd be so easy, so simple, so clean.  The human body is so fragile, isn't it?I don't think It's depression.  It's more like hunger.  The longer you go without eating, the worse it gets.  But unlike hunger, or thirst, or even taking a shit, I've only got to kill myself once and the urge will be filled.  It's been growing for years, and if I can finally follow through I'll never have to deal with it again. 
I have really bad dandruff	I'm kind of embarrassed about that also	I've never gotten a haircut by going to an actual place to get it done due to anxiety.   I've typically just had my dad cut my hair short every time I need one.   I plan on going to supercuts tomorrow.  Someone that's gone to supercuts can you walk me through the moment you walk in the door.  Like do I go up to the counter and ask for a haircut, do you tip, and what's the typical interactions I would go through there.    <e1> I have really bad dandruff </e1>  so  <e2> I'm kind of embarrassed about that also </e2> . 
I	on.	I have been through a period where I went cold turkey on my SSRI and took an anti psychotic instead.  Instead of being prescribed Cipralex I got a prescription for Zyprexa. This period has been one of the worst in my life.  Yes, I should have known better. My note to myself: Always check what medicine you are taking is the right one, the right dosage and so on.  
I'm curious	I'm bored a great deal at the moment	 <e1> I'm curious </e1>  because  <e2> I'm bored a great deal at the moment </e2> , but also bored frequently. 
Hello	question!	Hello daydreamers, I am really curious about the perspective your daydreams usually occur in, could you please tell me a little about whether your daydreams are usually in first person perspective (as in you visualize things from your own perspective, seeing them through your own eyes) or is it more like 3rd person perspective where you visualize somehow watching yourself from afar, like when you watch the main character in a movie?  Or is it somewhere in between for you?And another question, are you usually you as you are in real life, you as you wish you were, or someone entirely different?I am curious because I want to compare my own experience (3rd person, someone entirely different) and maybe explore what might cause the different approaches. edit: sorry for  the slow replies, I forgot I asked this question!
I didn't get thrown out of my house </e1>  or have to stay home from work	I somehow managed to avoid getting hung over despite the sheer amount of alcohol I had	I spent the last month or so relapsing, just shy of what would be my 30th day sober.  I spent the last two days drinking - it's a miracle that  <e1> I didn't get thrown out of my house </e1>  or have to stay home from work </e1>  because  <e2> I somehow managed to avoid getting hung over despite the sheer amount of alcohol I had </e2> .  Here I am back on the wagon, dealing with all sorts of fun anxiety attacks.  My mouth feels like ash and I'm looking for a therapist nearby that takes my insurance.  Here's hoping this time sticks. 
Hey	stressed	Hey guys,I'm new here, and actually new to this whole thing. After avoiding the situation for a long time, I finally went to a doctor today to talk about my mental health.  He has prescribed me Lexapro and referred me to a councillor.  At first, a HUGE weight was lifted off my shoulders- but now I just feel extremely overwhelmed about the situation and the journey ahead.  I told my SO that I would be going to the doctors for anxiety and his reaction was everyone gets stressed
I	school	I have severe rejection sensitivity; however, it only seems to be in social situations where I'm out with groups of people (and it's really bad). What's interesting is that I don't really have any problem with professional interactions.   I had to give a speech at my high school graduation to 5000 audience members.   I don't think I was any more nervous than most people would be about that.   In grad school
I've never had a girlfriend	my social skills have always been down the drain	Since the beginning of the semester, I've had a major crush on a female classmate in a college class that meets twice a week.  This is literally THE worst crush I've ever had.  I've had many crushes before but they lasted for a few days or a week or two max, but this one doesn't seem to be fading away.  The more time that passes, the greater my infatuation of her becomes.  And what makes this one even more special is that I actually have had some interaction with her, something I never had with any of previous crushes. Call me a loser, but I'm 19 years old and  <e1> I've never had a girlfriend </e1> .  Not because I didn't have the opportunity (at least that's what I think), but because  <e2> my social skills have always been down the drain </e2> , especially around women. Last week, I had a major personal breakthrough.  On Monday, after class, I walked up to her and I said the words I like your hair.  She replied in a cute little thanks while smiling
I'm	etc.	I'm having a really hard time understanding why a close friend is about to lose everything (family, marriage, job, and go to jail) but still cannot stop drinking? I thought jail would be a deterrent (it wasn't) and now I thought losing their kid/spouse would be a deterrent (it isn't) and I'm just struggling to keep an open mind and really understand it.  This person who makes really good choices in other parts of her life is making poor choices with alcohol and I'm starting to learn how debilitating of a disease it really is, but I want to learn more.   I think if I arm myself with knowledge, I can be more understanding and maybe less stressed about the situation myself.  TL;dr I want to learn more about why addicts still drink even when they don't want to.  Needs books/studies, etc. 
recent personal events	I've found that lack of drink DOES NOT cure asshole	So, I've finally got 500 days without drinking! And in light of  <e1> recent personal events </e1> ,  <e2> I've found that lack of drink DOES NOT cure asshole </e2> .  I'm still the same angry sack that can't express himself sometimes and I'm finally coming to terms with that.  I hope to work on this with therapy and medication.  Fingers crossed (and those of you who pray) keep me in your prayers.  The  imgur. com/Kaktf3b. jpg
I feel useless	I'm never going to be able to work a job I can be happy with and get paid for it	 <e1> I feel useless </e1> .   <e2> I'm never going to be able to work a job I can be happy with and get paid for it </e2> .  I sabotage myself whenever I'm successful or happy.   I'm heartbroken.  I'm fed up.  I'm tired of it.   I can't afford to get the help I know I need.  It'll be easier to give up. 
Hellllooooo	conversation!:)	Hellllooooo So this post is for anyone who can`t afford DBT in real life. What I am trying to do is a weekly study/ review session where we can also encourage each other or give each other helpful tips on our own recovery/ treatment!Tonights topic is cognitive distortions. Here is a link to a list:  dbtselfhelp. com/html/cognitive_distortions. htmlI guess how we can all start is by picking one of them and talking about how we have progressed away from that thought pattern within the last week. AND pick the cognitive distortion that you have had the most trouble with in the last week. We are all encouraged to reply to others posts since we are hoping to start conversation!:)
I've	any?	I've noticed there's a lot of subs that mostly paint non-sobriety as something terrible that must be fixed, but I can't seem to find any that aren't so gloomy and doomy.   Are there any?  
SO	myself	SO doesn't want a baby with me.  I'm probably not ready anyway, but I feel so rejected.  I pick up the phone, dial numbers, and no one answers.   Feel like this is it folks.  Like my life isn't going to get any better.  I failed at life.  What are the chances now that it's going to get better? The winter hasn't even started and I am ready to give up now.  I got no family, no friends and those I do have I can't live with the ways I'm not good enough for them.  There aren't enough drugs in the world to make me feel better. As much as I've been told I'm not good enough, I know I'm worthy of love.  I don't believe that I'm spiritual poison as a former cult leader told me.  I'm so sad that if I were to kill myself
I tend not to share my deeper feelings	I don't think anyone would completely understand me	I am someone who tries to keep control of the situation but I usually don't do a good job.  Although I have moments of increased frustration in which I will complain about something,  <e1> I tend not to share my deeper feelings </e1>  because  <e2> I don't think anyone would completely understand me </e2> .  This definitely doesn't help my situation because I already have so many thoughts racing through my head, and this only adds more.  I will have a difficult time letting go of these frustrations and I tend to sit in my basement alone just thinking and thinking until I'm too tired and finally fall asleep.  I am just curious to know how others with a similar situation deal with all of this.   Edit: Just added a little more detail to the description
Damn.	believes	Damn. . .  why did it have to come to this, ill be honest i use to blame others for my own choices, just so i could justify what i wanted to believe.  And for what? Wasted time, broken hearts,relationships cut off.  I push everyone that wants to help.  I am too fsr down the hole than what my family believes
I'm going to talk with my therapist about it	it just doesn't seem normal to subconsciously dream about something I have no desire to go back to	So usually when I get this far into quitting, I begin using adverse reactions/withdrawals.  I'm still vaping (6mg nic liquid), but a few notes:- I'm dreaming of smoking.  Like, VIVIDLY.  And in these dreams I'll get halfway through it, only to throw it out in disgust.   <e1> I'm going to talk with my therapist about it </e1>  (since I already deal with PTSD and chronic depression) because  <e2> it just doesn't seem normal to subconsciously dream about something I have no desire to go back to </e2> . Physical issues.  I'm getting sporadic joint pain throughout the day (not sure if it's related to quitting), and my acne has actually gotten worse.  I'm also coughing up a LOT of phlegm, which is normal for me when I go through these withdrawals, but I'm beginning to wonder when I won't be coughing this crap up anymore. Overall though, I'm happy I've made it this far, and plan to celebrate my 1 month with some friends over Halloween weekend.  Enjoy your Sunday and stay strong, guys and gals &lt;3
So	for	So I tried to stop gaming (for the most part) a few months ago, and managed to last for about a month.  Was bored for about a week, but then I started studying Japanese and cooking; so it wasn't all too bad.  Here's the post I made on the matter:  it/2a7hrtI had gotten some new hardware for my desktop, and I wanted to get back into gaming to est out my hardware.  I thought I could moderate how long I gamed for
Does	indecisive-ness?	Does anyone else have a terrible time making decisions. . . about everything?  I practically go to war with myself when faced with even the easiest choice.  I always end up flustered and annoyed.  Any ideas on how to combat this indecisive-ness?
I	up!	I just got diagnosed with ADHD-PI today.  Took 10mg Adderall IR two hours ago and right now I feel simply amazing.  I can actually sit down and type this post with full mental clarity and organized thoughts, rather than with the usual stream of consciousness.   I was furthermore able to watch a full episode of my favorite show on Netflix without pausing it every few minutes to open up a new tab and google something.  I think I will read a book next! One of the millions of books I had started but didn't end up finishing because of you know what. . . Anyway, for those of you currently seeking the diagnosis/help, don't give up!
If	yea	If I do decide to pull the trigger, nothing inherently benevolent or caring in this world would stop me.  No God comes down from the sky with loving arms, no cloud parts to reveal a divine plan that interrupts the whole thing; the curtains don't part and make way for a group of cosmic little helpers that save the show and put my life back on its healthy course.  Nope.  Just a plethora of arms dealers and cheap bullets to help me on my way.  Just a mound of problems that never resolve themselves and only seem to attract more, in a snowball fashion. I hear this all the time: yea
am reluctant to prioritize my mental health	I have already tried so many medicines, partial hospitalization,  etc.  with little success	I have recently moved to NYC and started a new job with normal hours (9 to 5 or 6).  I'm really struggling with anxiety and depression, as I have been for years.  I've had lots of help in the past with meds and therapy while in HS and college, but nothing has really helped long term except for Welbutrin (which only keeps me from sleeping all day).  I'm still on my mom's insurance which is kinda shitty but would cover some costs I think.  I'm low on funds but  <e1> am reluctant to prioritize my mental health </e1>  because  <e2> I have already tried so many medicines, partial hospitalization,  etc.  with little success </e2> .  I tried to get involved with a NYC free program from Columbia but they only operate from 9-4.  I should mention I'm a full time freelancer, not salaried, and this is only my 2nd week there. My question is: How do you guys get help when you work full time? Any suggestions for free/cheap help or support in NYC? Im tired of waiting every day for the moment I can crawl back into bed. 
I worry that my anxiety about my boyfriend's drinking	the loss of my father	I'm happy to have found this subreddit and I'm hoping I can get some honest opinions from you fine people. My boyfriend is a really great guy and has not exhibited many of the typical red flags, but I want to tell you all how I feel and what I see, so someone can tell me if I'm reading too much into this or not. Disclaimer - I recently lost my father (who was only 54) to cancer.   His condition was exacerbated by chronic alcohol use and  <e1> I worry that my anxiety about my boyfriend's drinking </e1>  may be partially due to  <e2> the loss of my father </e2> . here are the specs on my lovely man:-drinks ill it's gone-recent weight gain and obvious distaste for it
Hey	laptop/phone.	Hey everyone I have been getting extremely distracted despite being on my meds when I am studying - does anyone have any tips to help stay focused on the task at hand?Maybe like a timer that locks my computer for 30 minutes at a time? I'm running apple laptop/phone.  
I find myself edging every two or three days	I'm getting frustrated	I am doing a good job of not orgasming to any porn but  <e1> I find myself edging every two or three days </e1>  until I think o I can't do this and stop.  It is eating into me slowly and I know that after about 2 or three weeks I end up pmoing.   <e2> I'm getting frustrated </e2>  and need a better distraction. 
I'm	do.	I'm a little drunk.  My boyfriend and I drink a lot.  I'm to the point where I don't want to.  I am too afraid to leave and go back to my family.  I don't know why.  I've already bruised my thighs and hurt my hand really bad which I need for work.  I can't stop crying.  I have my clothes packed, my cat ready but I just can't bring myself to go out the door.  Or end it all so easily.  I've already written a letter to my dad.  I don't know what to do.  
.	hard	. . . Mostly because I don't feel like I have FINISHED anything!I have spent 2 days wandering around my new house.  I got a LOT done, but it felt so chaotic. I tried to put stuff away in the Kitchen, half loaded the dishwasher, left the fridge open while I was washing dishes, started 3 different garbage bags because I forgot about the one before, forgot to actually EAT for 2 days (thankfully other family members DO get hungry now and then and remind me).  I also have to constantly focus because I hoard.  I have had to keep telling myself IF we need that (likely unused for more than a year small item) we are financially stable enough to replace it so I can purge the multiple multiples of things we do not have space for as well. Having ADHD is hard
I	knives.	I could use somebody with sound judgement to help me make the call that it is 100% the same person and beyond that could use somebody chiming in on whether I should contact his posted relativesThe alarming posts contained things like pic of him with open pill bottle, here's my collection of knives. 
I feel shitty	I feel the need to drink alcohol	I'm 16, I've been drinking for around 3 years now and I still don't understand if I'm addicted or not, thing is, whenever I drink, I end up feeling really good (just like everyone) but my tolerance is really fucking low (I got light headed off 1-2 beer cans) and I can go without alcohol for weeks and months with no problem, but whenever  <e1> I feel shitty </e1> ,  <e2> I feel the need to drink alcohol </e2> , almost like a coping mechanism.  Am I addicted or not?
I broke up with her	I thought that she deserved someone who loves her as much as she did loved me	We were both 17 and seniors in differnt high schools.  I was with the girl of my dreams for about 1 year.  I had stress from school from home/family, from tons of ways.  For some reason near the end of our relationship I hardly liked her at all, but she loved me so much.  She wanted to tell me she did but was nervous at what I would say.  I could see it in her.  She loved me with all her heart.  And in return I didnt really feel anything but I wanted her to be happy.  So  <e1> I broke up with her </e1>  because  <e2> I thought that she deserved someone who loves her as much as she did loved me </e2> .  So I broke up with her.  I BROKE UP WITH HER.  FUCK.  Its what i thought was right at the time.  But about a month after my mind went into what have i done mode.  I wanted for her to be happy

I	pain.	I made it through yesterday.  But I won't make it through today.  I'm supposed to see a psychologist in an hour, but I won't make it that long.  I still have no medication.  I have nothing to help me.  My ex won't acknowledge my existence.  My parents ask how they can help then they don't do what I ask for help.  I've reached out to so many people the past few days and so many of you have reached out to me.  Thank you, it's gotten me this far.  But talking about it only helps so much for so long.  I know I always told myself I would never use my gun , but right now it's my only option other than jumping off the bridge, and I don't want to die in cold water , I'd rather it be warm and quick.  I'm so scared of where I'm supposed to shoot though.  What if I shoot the wrong spot and it doesn't work? What if I live through it? I just want it to be over in the blink of an eye, peacefully with no pain.  
Today	recovery?	Today was awesome.  Had probably the best sex with my wife in a long time.  Woke up a little sleepy, but Jesus, when I got into work, I was just on fire.  Totally confident, laughing, hanging out with my peeps (although I am the boss, I still have some great friends in my shop).  Whipped through my entire inbox, meetings ran great, my shop sang me happy birthday, my assistant sent me home early.  I've heard about this before and heard that it is dangerous.  Anyone else have this experience in early recovery?
So far so good on this end	Feeling a bit more sane	How is everyone today?  <e1> So far so good on this end </e1> .   <e2> Feeling a bit more sane </e2>  this week.  Therapy has been rough, but necessary.  I have to work on controlling my obsessive/negative thoughts.  Give the ex space, and work on ourselves so that the potential for coming back together one day is greater. I know he's sleeping with other girls.  Well, I don't KNOW, but gut feelings and all that. . . but I can't be worried about him right now.  All of this, what we are all doing and going through. . . is easier said than done. Keep focusing on that goal, one day at a time :) 
For	life	For as long as I can remember I have not been happy. . .  I am 21, and I remember being sad/depressed ever since I was in eighth grade.  I'm starting to think that I have something legitimately f*cked up in my head, but I am relatively ignorant about being diagnosed with something.  Here's some background to my life.  Throughout high school I was pretty much a loner, dabbled in some substance and recently dropped it all cold turkey, and now working my ass off at school.  Which is good, because I am doing well in school, but I am still not happy.  I still have no friends, I can't talk to people, I have no social skills.  At first thought you would probably think I'm the most boring person ever.  I show no emotion and you can literally see the depression on my face.  It's pathetic because I don't know why I am so sad and lifeless.  Nothing raumatizing has ever really occurred in my life
I want to explain to my friend about my impulse control problems	He thinks that I don't care about how I act and taking care of other people's property	I posted something about this a while back, but I'm still trying to figure some things out.   <e1> I want to explain to my friend about my impulse control problems </e1> .   <e2> He thinks that I don't care about how I act and taking care of other people's property </e2> .  That isn't true.  Sometimes I just do things without thinking about it and I just push my common sense aside.  My friend thinks my I'm Sorry's and I wasn't thinkings are just flat excuses I use to push things under the rug.  It's not! I'm not trying to screw myself over and push things under the rug.  I'm not trying to piss people off! Sometimes I just don't think! I don't know why!!
When	o;	When at parties, I can't stay in one place for too long - unless I'm actively engaged in a conversation, I get the urge to get up and walk away.  So I'll listen in on one conversation for 5 minutes, then walk over to another group and listen to their conversation for 5 minutes, then repeat.  I've actually had several people point out to me that I do this, but I still have no idea why.  If I can't find another group that I feel like I can join, I'll either circle around for a while (and look like a weirdo), or disappear to the bathroom.  Maybe it is a form of introversion, like I have a low limit for amount of time spent with people I don't know well? I thought I had stopped doing it as an adult, but then I went to a party recently and it happened again o. o;
I'm	try)	I'm entirely convinced that zen/mindfulness meditation is the closest thing we have to a cure for anxiety. Anxiety is mental conditioning, and meditation is the practice of experiencing the world without conditioning, without the mind interfering. Im just curious has anyone here made a serious effort and not seen results?edit: /r/meditation is a good place to start learning if you've never tried (and you should definitely try)
Hey	go!Peace,Summoner91x	Hey team,so I got to 22 days, which looking back on I'm really happy about! My 2nd longest streak since November 2013. But then I relapsed on Sunday 19th after my hot friend had left.  It was a bit of an awkward weekend for other reasons, but I was tired and run down, and feeling a bit lonely so gave in then and Monday. . .  Had Tues and Weds p-free, then back again Thurs + Fri. . .  Went without yesterday and decided I want in on this again, and appreciate the support, advice and encouragement of this subreddit, so this is officially Day 2.  Let's go!Peace,Summoner91x
Well	support!	Well as I told many of you I was rather worried about how it would turn out with a long excel test.  I've done well enough to get a second interview tomorrow!Now just to interview and then go take my final in my masters level account class! Thanks for the support!
I	around	I love Alice in Wonderland what worries me is that it makes total sense to me .  The part where Alice sits with the mad hatter at the dining room table . I completely understand where they are coming from and i find it very somber .  should i start to get worried ? Sometimes i feel like the world we live in is just make believe and someday i will wake up .  Maybe i am off my rocker but sometimes it feels like i am the only sane person around

Title	bad	Title is kind of confusing but I wasn't sure how to word it.  In middle school I was very impulsive and talkative.  I used to get at least a detention a day for talking.  I literally talked to anyone I was around, even if I didn't know them.  I would also make an ass out of myself too, now that I look back at it.  I would ways argue with teachers.  Or when they'd say something I'd shout something back at them.  I. e my teacher was talking about how it annoys him when people talk when he ask them to stop.  I then said aloud I always tell you to stop talking in my head but it never works just one of many things.  Only one I vividly remember though.  I was also on the tier program.  Not sure if any of you are farmiliar with that or not but basically I was in tier 1 the 5% of students who are doing bad
I	going.	I feel like I'm getting help for a bunch of mental illness that can't be specified and the counselors all get frustrated and confused by me.  How can I be open an honest with a counselor, when I can't even be open and honest with myself? I keep trying and trying, medication after medication, counselor after counselor.  Also I try to open up to myself a lot, but it's really slow going. 
I	fixing.	I can't think of anything to stop me this time.  Everything is hopeless and nothing is worth fixing. 
If	choose?	If you had a choice between receiving a device that could shut you down permanently without pain or receive a million dollars , what would you choose?
tired of understanding the material but being crushed on tests	I was I get terrible marks on all my tests despite hours of study and a real understanding of the material	I'm in first year university and am really  <e1> tired of understanding the material but being crushed on tests </e1> .  I've been medicated for years and though I am a lot better than  <e2> I was I get terrible marks on all my tests despite hours of study and a real understanding of the material </e2> .  For example on my psyc midterm I knew where each lobe in the brain was and what it did but I couldn't for the life of me remember the names of the lobes.  Does anyone else have similar experiences? Is this even an ADHD issue? How can I fix this?  
i try to distance myself from my friends	smile when i see them and not talk too much	i feel like it's my duty to the world to somehow publicly announce that i am a piece of crap.   <e1> i try to distance myself from my friends </e1> ,  <e2> smile when i see them and not talk too much </e2> , but they still hate when I'm around.  i've said i'll kill myself so many times that i guess obsessive liar is another trait i can add to my list.  i ran out of space on my hands to count the people who have said that the world will be a better place without me. i've been waiting so long for my grandparents to die.  that's what everyone tells me.  your grandparents wouldn't be able to handle it.  so i've just sat here for years telling people i'm happy and smiling.  counselors and doctors find ways to ditch me continually.  and i don't blame them in the least. look at me

Sleeping is the hardest part for me	Crazy dreams about people I haven't seen in years and places I haven't been since I was a little kid	Middle of the night, day. . .

It's kind of dumb to say that	I take preworkout 5x a week	Let me start off by saying I have a VERY addictive personality.  I DON'T, or rather would not want to take stimulants for that reason. . .   <e1> It's kind of dumb to say that </e1>  because  <e2> I take preworkout 5x a week </e2> .   It helps bring me in the now.  I have been taking DMAE for 3 weeks now.  The effects are noticeable but I could benefit from something more.  With DMAE, there is a slight increase in focus.  I also sleep all night without waking up which is a huge plus.  School is becoming somewhat overwhelming and I don't know how much more I can take before I collapse.  School is my main concern.  I can't focus to save my life.  Also knowing that you have to study/do assignments but you can't, for whatever reason, bring yourself to do it kills me. . .  The I'll do it later syndrome.

he's always afraid that he has stopped loving me and will lose me	he thought this other girl was cute	My boyfriend has had OCD since he was 9 years old and we just found out he has Pure O OCD.

For Example, he's got ROCD with the Pure O, and  <e1> he's always afraid that he has stopped loving me and will lose me </e1>  because  <e2> he thought this other girl was cute </e2> .

I	fears.	I have been doing contract work for the last 5 years.  I was offered a permanent position with a local company yesterday.

my brain just hasn't come online totally yet	I was wondering what else can I do to help my cope with the smaller dose in the morning	For a while I was on 30mg of ritalin a morning with 20gm in the afternoon and I while I knew it for a while that my Rit was causing me anxiety in the morning I noticed recently how nonfunctional it was making me.  Quite the opposite to what I wanted.  Luckily I have the freedom given to me by my dr to change my dose as I need it as long as I don't exceed my dose of 60mg a day.  I have start today on only 20mg and the anxiety is way less but  <e1> my brain just hasn't come online totally yet </e1> . So  <e2> I was wondering what else can I do to help my cope with the smaller dose in the morning </e2>  until it gets used to it.  NB: I know a lot of people here are sensitive to coffee and I know some people will advise me not to have coffee but I am not sensitive to coffee, I can drink it at night and it causes me no ill affects, not even lack of sleep.  But I have already started ramping down how much I drink anyway. 
I'm worried	I won't go to heaven if I die now	15/f here.  I've been depressed for two years now, and I've gotten that far.  But, now, trying not to die is as difficult as trying not to fall asleep.

I'm quite worried right now	I've been on treatment with Ritalin for the past 2 years	Hi everyone. I'm planning on living at Russia.  But  <e1> I'm quite worried right now </e1> .  <e2> I've been on treatment with Ritalin for the past 2 years </e2> . On 2 different sites, one is Wikipedia. org. ru I've seen that Ritalin is banned there.  It appears Russia views Ritalin as a poison.  The fact that it was developed in the US doesn't seem to help. Anyway, this could pose a big issue.  Anyone knows if it is really forbidden there? Would I be able to carry and take it legally if I was prescribed by a doctor from another country, if it is forbidden there?Obviously is not a viable solution to travel abroad every 2 months to get a prescription.

So	guys.	So today is the first time I've flown since my anxiety symptoms began.  I kept calm and made it onto the first plane no problem.  But as soon as we took off my anxiety set in hard and made for a terrible flight.  Now I have a layover and am dreading the thought of my next flight.  Fortunately they are both very short flights, but still, the idea of battling these terrible feelings in a tight, confined space has me worried.  So, any advice on how to prepare for my flight over the next hour? If you have struggled with something similar, how do you deal with anxiety on flights?I have some ativan on me, but I haven't taken it in a while and would like to face this with out medication.  I may end up popping a benadryl to help knock me out for the flight though. Thanks :)**Edit**Made it just fine! The first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes were rough, but otherwise it went relatively well.  Music, and a mindless mobile game helped get me through it.  Thanks guys. 
So	myself.	So I fucked up.  Was clean from dope since February with only one relapse.   Started playing with etizolam around four months and it kinda escalated from there.  Fortunately I was able to avoid dependence on the benzos but before I knew it I was back on the dnms ordering roxies, my first true love.   Managed to chip for about a month.  Ended up grabbing some kind of fent/dope mixture that I've done every day for the past week.  Tomorrow is day one.  What can I expect from withdrawals? I deleted my DNM accounts, put whatever btc I had in my active wallet back in cold storage.  Time to get serious.  Need a new job.  Need a new life.  Can't start digging holes again.  So ashamed.  So embarrassed.  Help me.  I'm so scared about withdrawing.  I have vacation time coming up and I almost feel like I should just ride it out and maintain til then so I can withdraw at home cause work is gonna suck a hundred dick tomorrow and Friday but that's junkie talk, isn't it.  Lawd today I sure do hate myself. 
It's embarrassing and frustrating	how I haven't figured this out yet	All my stimulant meds since I began treatment stop working far too soon.  I've been on so many types and brands; big dose, little dose, doesn't matter.  My psych and I are pretty sure it isn't the euphoric feeling being mistaken for the actual benefit.  Right now I'm on Adderall IR 10mg, 4x/day, and it lasts me only about eight hours.  (FWIW: Caffeine does nothing to me, and my BP measures normal while my stim Rx is working)Have you ever had similar issues with your Rx? What did you do? I don't want it to be any stronger, just last even half as long as the doctors and ads say it usually does.   <e1> It's embarrassing and frustrating </e1>   <e2> how I haven't figured this out yet </e2> . 
I don't see much about people	I'm curious as to whether you feel like your life has stabilized	I read a lot about switching meds, upping meds and starting/stopping meds here.   <e1> I don't see much about people </e1>  who have been on the same meds for a long period of time (as adults).  For those of you that have,  <e2> I'm curious as to whether you feel like your life has stabilized </e2> , and what your overall thoughts are of your life before and after meds. 
I used to wrestle (was good) and am prone to violence when drunk	most of the time I win and get arrested	I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.  I am certain I am depressed, but drugs will help alleviate the depression legal and illegal drugs and alcohol.  I've gotten sober after driving drunk and fighting people at red lights and bars, etc, etc.   <e1> I used to wrestle (was good) and am prone to violence when drunk </e1> .   <e2> most of the time I win and get arrested </e2> . Anyway, I never drink anymore. I take 60mg.  Cymbalta and benzos.  I just don't enjoy anything anymore. I exercise daily.  I force myself, not because it's pleasurable.  I do get a bit of endorphin rush when I'm done. Is this it? I mean, people like us just go along depressed get old and die?Maybe increasing the Cymbalta dosage would help?
my psychiatrist was worried about my heartrate	he told me to try concerta for a week	For the past 1 1/2 months i've been taking 50 mg vyvanse.  My resting heartrate would be around 100-115 bpm while on my meds.  My blood pressure was still normal but  <e1> my psychiatrist was worried about my heartrate </e1>  so  <e2> he told me to try concerta for a week </e2> .  I still had the same heartrate but it wasn't effective enough.  He has now told me to split the pill and just take 25mg a day.  I've read that your heartrate is supposed to go down the longer you take it.  I also tried strattera but I had bad experiences with it.  But honestly I don't mind if I could feel my heart beat but if my heartrate stayed at 100-115, what would be the long term effect?  
glad to say I'm more resolved than ever	I will not drink today	Wasn't sure when I started that I'd make it this far.  So  <e1> glad to say I'm more resolved than ever </e1>  that  <e2> I will not drink today </e2> .  Life is so much better sober.  
I really can't shake my hatred of email	I put emails off and I get anxious	I consider my love of talking to people as one of my best attributes, but  <e1> I really can't shake my hatred of email </e1> .   <e2> I put emails off and I get anxious </e2> .  The longer I put them off, the more anxious I get and the worse I feel about myself.  Does anyone else have trouble with this form of communication? You would think it would make things easier for someone with ADHD.

Please	are.	Please read this book, effortless mastery by kenny werner.  I guarantee you'll resonate with him 100%.  The book isn't that long and it connects the dots so well.  Here's a passage about self worth that I found so important.  Nearly brought me to tears.   com/rnNEuhYHe talks about being so overwhelmed  by practicing and how your mind isn't you, and to detach from the ego.  He also talks a lot about meditation.  A good read even if you're not particularly into music.  But more important if you are.  
For	However	For me, i have actually noticed that boredom/understimulation causes my disordered anxiety. I am an anxious person in general, and stuff like being busy and having deadlines pile up is anxiety inducing, but it feels like that' s good anxiety.  Like i am constantly in the zone and on the grind. However
I'm	this.	I'm 13, I've been having panic attacks since I was 4/5.  I had three today, but usually I have one every 1-2 days.  I am seeing a school counsellor but I can't open up to her.  Is it normal to have this happen? I feel like it would be selfish to even consider that I have anxiety, but I hate dealing with this.  
I felt so heavy	I was unable to do anything	All this negativity in my mind is just so damn convincing.  It all makes sense.  There's just nothing to gain in life.  There's no joy, only burdens.  I'm unable to form relationships.  I don't earn enough for a living to even attempt to buy myself some happiness.  I took a week off this week for my birthday.  But  <e1> I felt so heavy </e1>   <e2> I was unable to do anything </e2> .  Nothing at all.  And what's supposed to be a happy day was just dreadful loneliness.  No presents.  I couldn't even treat myself.  It's just the sign of another year leaving its imprint in my soul. How the fuck do you keep going? There's just no point! 
I'm curious	how much our medication affects others brain chemistry	I'm a teen, diagnosed with ADHD since I was 6 years old and  <e1> I'm curious </e1>  as to  <e2> how much our medication affects others brain chemistry </e2> , such as people without ADHD.  For example, what kind of effects can someone without ADHD fall under if they take certain meds? I currently take 3MG Intuniv (Guanfacine) and up until 7th grade, I took Adderall. 
And	now).	And I have already started a quitting spree. . .

(I have already cut down on hard drinks and am down to only beer now). 
I	Thanks.	I came from a very ugly place- but for once the future looks good. From the outside my life looks great and I suppose it should be. I feel like the guy in the marathon who collapses right before the finish line. The bottle creeps up on me and it brings its friends: other drugs, bad food, bad thoughts.   I try to stay productive but I find a way to let myself down.  Most days I manage to avoid it but I make up for that on the days I dont.  This is my first post.  Ive lived my life totally wrong and I didnt care until I realised it was actually valued by others. Any advice would be appreciated? Im happy with baby steps.  I realize I'm not getting out of this hole unless I build my own ladder but I dont know how to do it.  When you guys wake up, what is it that keeps you away from the booze that day? Congrats to the ones who have found a way and best of luck to those who are still working on it.  Thanks.

(Usual	hypothesis	(Usual caveat: this is not meant as medical advice and probably only applies to a small subset of people suffering from BPII anyway.  As always, consult with your doctor before beginning any sort of treatment. )I've noticed something about my symptoms recently.  I feel good today(!!!), as opposed to 99% of the time where I'm incapacitated from depression, and I think it has something to do with sleep.  I think it has something to do with inflammation. Let me explain.  The first med that ever helped relieve my symptoms was Prednisone, a systemic corticosteroid that is known to be one of the most aggressive drugs against inflammation.  If you want to completely put the kibosh on your immune response, Prednisone is like your emergency brakes.  After a circuitous and fruitless route through the medical system that landed me in this thread, and ultimately with the BPII diagnosis, I looked back and thought it was probably just making me hypomanic (hence, the feeling good).  This is still very much a possibility I suppose, and currently what I consider my ull hypothesis
I	1	I don't know why I haven't yet, I listed pros and con's to suicide and had no con's.  I have no reason to go on.  I get depressed to the point where I want to just scream and cry.  I have nobody I really wish I had someone, anyone, just a hug or some affection.  Something real.  I know you people are real but I feel nothing when someone says I care online or some bullshit.  My new deadline if I hadn't found a reason to go on will be January 1
I'm	attention	I'm trying my hardest to be strong, not to feel that endless void in my chest.  Doing that allows me not to cry or think about suicide each and ever day, but it doesn't make me happy.  I believe that what I really crave is someone like a very close friend/girlfriend.  When I feel even the slightest urge of sympathy to a girl I come alive for some time.  I know I'm just rambling and being pathetic, but it's rather sad when no one shows the slightest interest in me.  Heh, I even made a okcupid account and tried chatting with other people similar to me, still the same. TL;DR OP craves for attention

When	20s)	When I last went to the doctor, she said a term to refer to the medications like ritaln.  But that term meant that the body gets used to these medications over time of use and eventually they stop working and have to be upped in dosage. What I'm curious is isn't that going to be expensive down the road? As my dosage increases, so does the price.  Will I have to look forward to paying very large amounts for my medication in the future? (I'm still in my early 20s)
im glad	some of it went away at first	hi, im on 100 lamictal twice a day, and i take klonopin and neurontin at night for sleeping, sometimes klonopin during the day if im having a panic attack.  but i lost alllllll my libido.  and i mean i used to have a mean libido.  so  <e1> im glad </e1>   <e2> some of it went away at first </e2> .  but now it's just straight up gone.  so my pdoc put me on a low dose of wellbutrin.  anyone have any advice or experiences? i know we all have different minds and bodies but still wanted to know what to expect, sorta.

(Halloween, family reunion, etc. ) also, I love drinking scotch.  I love a fine single malt.  Except, when I drink, I can't stop.  Input?
which is funny	I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed anxiety	Has anybody else dealt with this? It's been frustrating in the past getting what I need from others when they're sure I have autism (even my dad is guilty of this,  <e1> which is funny </e1>  because  <e2> I'm pretty sure he has undiagnosed anxiety </e2> ) based on symptoms that are shared with autism, especially social situations. 
For	anymore	For years every time I've thought about killing myself it always scared me way too much to ever do it, but recently its the only thing bringing me calm and peace, I really have nothing for me right now, it's rare if I even make it out of bed, no ones gonna miss me or anything, I just don't know what to do anymore
I kept getting turned down	insurance reasons or just not enough room	I've been heavily drinking for three years and finally got to the point where I felt I needed detox.  I've been going to AA meetings for a couple months but now it's bigger than that.  Left this morning at 9am and went to 4 different places-- from hospitals to free homeless housings.   <e1> I kept getting turned down </e1>  for  <e2> insurance reasons or just not enough room </e2> .  My case worker almost lost his shit but finally we found a place that will take me in the morning.  I have no idea what to expect.  Can anyone tell me what's going to happen?
The	advice?	The face thing is the biggest problem, I can deal with the other two.  My face involuntarily distorts into an uncomfortable nervous grimace; there's nothing I can do to change it to a neutral resting face.  It's like I have Asperger's (not said in a pejorative way - that's actually what it comes across like).   I've recently moved to a new city and I'm having a lot of trouble being confident.  None of this occurs when I'm comfortable with friends.  Intellectually I think I'm going okay and have reasonable self-esteem, but then an awkward social event happens and I question everything.  I've had a horrible year in terms of personal events, and I feel like they're leaking through and have destroyed my personality.  I haven't been this shy and awkward for years - the most disheartening thing about this is thinking that I've regressed.  Any advice? 
I'm uncomfortable talking to new people	I'd prefer to be alone	Hi everybody,First time on /r/Anxiety and I just had questions about Anxiety. Basically, what qualifies as anxiety?I've always been a shy kid, and I tried to grow out of it throughout college, but it's kinda hard.  I can talk in social environments, but  <e1> I'm uncomfortable talking to new people </e1> .   <e2> I'd prefer to be alone </e2> .  I'm also always scared of what people think of me.  I think that people are judging me constantly and don't want to look like something I'm not. I've wanted to talk to a doctor about this, but I'm not sure where to go / how to approach it. .  I've had a family doctor but only went for check-ups.  I'm also Asian and they're Asian and I'd prefer to go to a white doctor for this. .  if that makes sense (probably doesn't unless you're Asian lol).  I do have bluecross blue shield.  Could I possibly get a check up at a hospital with my insurance?
This	Thoughts?	This is the first time that I've been in a new romantic relationship since I started suffering from depression, and I was wondering how y'all approach the topic? I'm afraid that I'll just scare her off if I bring it up, but I also feel like it's something she should know at some point.  Thoughts?
The lack of stability in our relationship in the past	gives me anxieties moving forward	I love her, and we've been through some harsh stuff and come out on top so far.  We support each other to the utmost of our ability, but I can't help but end up feeling like shit myself sometimes when she's in the dumps.  And I'm sure that's a reciprocated thing.   <e1> The lack of stability in our relationship in the past </e1>   <e2> gives me anxieties moving forward </e2> .  I find myself thinking of hypothetical break up scenarios and wondering if it would make me depressed enough to actualize my suicidal ideation.  I want to have a future with her, but I wonder if I should even be in a relationship at all right now.  I've talked to her about this before but the conversation didn't really go anywhere.  I just don't know. 
It's getting harder and harder every day	I don't have friends and I barely have family	I'm just not okay.  I try to be happy and cheerful around this time.  But it hurts so much.  I have no one around me that genuinely cares about me exempt my dad.   <e1> It's getting harder and harder every day </e1> .   <e2> I don't have friends and I barely have family </e2> .  I feel so numb inside.  Like I wish bi could just go to sleep one night and never wake up.  I hate this time of year.  Everyone is so happy and cheerful and I'm just here crying every night wanting to be okay, but I'm not. . .  I just want it all to end
Im really curious	what everyone else would consider some of there accomplishments	We are a mess.  We can't think, we cant organize, cant process information so on and so forth but hey when we do, we go all the way.  I know when I hyperfocus or love something I can accomplish anything.   <e1> Im really curious </e1>  about  <e2> what everyone else would consider some of there accomplishments </e2> .  Please share.  
I	Thanks!	I live in NJ, and our program is abysmal (the list has maybe 6 illnesses on it and none of them have anything at all to do with mental health), though for some bizarre reason there's a local psychiatrist registered with the NJ Medical Marijuana Program. Many days I wonder that if I were to be prescribed some kind of indica strain (hopefully the exact opposite of what I used to smoke for fun as a late-teens punkass which started giving me panic attacks) that my entire life might be different, that I'd be allowed to live a productive and normal life and stop being a benzo addict who doesn't leave the house for months at a time and has no future whatsoever. I've read articles here and there about it--including plenty from those who swear by it--but I was curious to hear from some real people, those I tend to respect the opinions of much more. Thanks!
I	do.	I made a mistake, about a year after my girlfriend made a much worse mistake.  Yet somehow right now I feel like she would be much happier if I were gone.  My father doesn't give two shits about me, and I'm worried of what I might do. 
I'm worried	for some reason that the medicine will have killed my sex-drive forever	Greetings r/anxiety.  The question I have is that I have been on 25mg of Zoloft for around 8 months for anxiety and just recently has my psychiatrist approved of me lowering the dose hopefully to get me off of it soon. The main trouble side effect I have had is a nearly complete loss of libido.  Is this very common (I'm male) and will it return with continued reduction and offing of my medication.   <e1> I'm worried </e1>  that  <e2> for some reason that the medicine will have killed my sex-drive forever </e2>  which I hope isn't the case. Thanks :)
Hello	brain	Hello everyone!I want to share with you a discovery that I have made that will surely help in recovering from this horrible addiction.  There are many factors involved in developing porn addiction, and we have all likely heard about the role that dopamine plays.  Well, there may be a way to re-sensitize our brains to dopamine using nutrition.  One angle that I have yet to see talked about is the role of vitamin/mineral deficiency, specifically magnesium.  It turns out that dopamine is a magnesium dependent neurotransmitter.  Interestingly, up to 80% of us are deficient in magnesium because of poor diet and soil depletion.  ( jigsawhealth. com/resources/magnesium-mineral-deficiency)Is there a connection? Here's part of an article that I found:  com/View. aspx?url=Article819QuoteDopamine has been called the pleasure neurotransmitter and evidence shows that dopamine is a magnesium-dependent neurotransmitter. (5) It is possible that low levels of magnesium trigger low levels in dopamine in the brain
I've had a very mediocre adolesence and early adulthood	I am very lonely	I have too many reasons, too many reasons.  I've been in treatment for the past two  years and I have gotten worse and worse.  I have parents but they're getting frustrated with me.   <e1> I've had a very mediocre adolesence and early adulthood </e1>  such that  <e2> I am very lonely </e2> .  I have intense anxiety about things no one can relate to.  I just hate every minute I spend awake.  On top of that I have horrible headaches and musical hallucinations which aren't quite schizophrenic but I haven't found any remedy for.  I'm just so ready to die and cash in my karma chips. 
freaking out	I didn't do it	Fuck, I have done none of my homework for the past week.  It's like I'm stuck in some limbo of not caring to do it and  <e1> freaking out </e1>  because  <e2> I didn't do it </e2> .  I'm not invested in the assignment at all.  I have to read an article ok a book I didn't understand and then make 20 notecard things either summarizing, paraphrasing, directly quoting, or draw an original thought from it.  I can't do this, my teacher already have me an extension, the worst part is once I'm done, I have to do another.  All this piled on with reading another book I don't have time to read and somehow annotating it with deep, omnipotent connections.  Oh yeah, and all the other fucking homework from school.  I have tests up the wazoo and that doesn't count finals.  I'm always surrounded by people who are ashamed to be getting a b in a class while I would kill for one.  I'm such a lazy asshole I hate this.  Fuck.  
I barely leave the house	I can't stand the building sensation of a panic attack I get when outside	I don't know what is causing my anxiety but it has never gone away after about 7 years now.  It's there everyday I wake up.  I feel like I am going to embarrass myself, do something stupid, say something dumb and so on.   <e1> I barely leave the house </e1>  because  <e2> I can't stand the building sensation of a panic attack I get when outside </e2> .  I always feel vulnerable like the world is out to get me.  Like people are plotting and scheming behind my back to destroy me fully.  I have never had a girlfriend and I have no friends.  I couldn't I am too boring and awkward around them.  I screw up everything that can be screwed up.  I'm sexually frustrated.  I hate myself.  I don't know how much longer I can stand this.  The worse thing is I feel like I have no real connections to people or the world around me.  Everything feels hollow except for some dread that people hate me and I am causing them to hate me. 
I've managed to finish college and find some part time work	I have some money I can use to get presents for my family this holiday season	Now that <e1>  I've managed to finish college and find some part time work </e1> ,  <e2> I have some money I can use to get presents for my family this holiday season </e2> ! BUT here's how my mind has approached this: - Let's go to the store! Twenty minutes later: Has forgotten to go. - In a store: I want to buy almost EVERYTHING I see. - Too many people and things why was I here again oh right to sit on Santa's lap!- Come home virtually empty handed. So far, online shopping has limited me to:- Only what I search for and nothing else. - Similar items and quick reviews of each item. - I'm in control of external stimuli (people, noise, etc)- Once I find what I want, I click checkout with my already set up account and am ALLOWED to forget about it until it shows up at the door.  (Hopefully it does otherwise
So	time.	So I'm 15, and I started Adderall XR in September.  I've gotten skinnier, and have a lighter appetite than before.  I just. . .  don't get as hungry.  If no one makes supper, I'll eat snacks, but when there aren't even snacks, I just won't eat.  Everyone is concerned, but chose to either heckle me, get mad at me, and/or blame me, including my mom, and it kills my appetite even more (for instance, my mom, my sister and I were in a restaurant the other day and toward the end of the meal, my sister said 'watch, he's going to tap out'.  I wasn't full, but it was depressing to hear that, and I stopped).   I'm really picky on what I eat (especially if I have to eat it regularly), but there's nothing in my house most of the time.

Its hard to type	I took something with my boyfriend that has me feeling really weird	Things just seem to be getting worse, and the thoughts of killing myself are really starting to take over. . .  that being said, I decided to take a lot of my pills last night. I don't know why.  I was feeling depressed and I guess something kinda snapped and I took some.  Then some more. . .  then some more. . Obviously I'm fine, but today I've just felt off.  Like I'm just emotionally numb.  I'm actually angry too.  I'm never angry.  And part of me really wants to not fail this time.  I already unwrapped all of my pills and I have more than I did last night.  <e1> Its hard to type </e1>  because  <e2> I took something with my boyfriend that has me feeling really weird </e2> , and I have too much to say, so I'm gonna leave it at that. 
I was younger, I would dismiss	I didn't do something well and/or on time as as a consequence of being bored and understimulated	Hey all.  I'm just curious what your response is to this thought and question.  When  <e1> I was younger, I would dismiss </e1>  when  <e2> I didn't do something well and/or on time as as a consequence of being bored and understimulated </e2> .  Now I realize that though sometimes things are boring to me
I'm	in.	I'm depressed.  There's no other way to put it.  My perception on things are pretty fucked up and my motivation is completely absent.  I don't want to do anything.  I have no coping abilities.  I've never coped with anything, well not in a healthy way.  My inability to cope is interfering with my perception of life.  I'm angry a lot.  I hate it.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I've considered journaling my emotions and this is my attempt.  Hopefully I stick to it.  I want to get better.  I'm tired of being my own worst enemy.  I need to express myself in way that doesn't actually put me completely out there.  I'm not ready to talk to my significant other.  I can't let him completely in.  I've never let anyone completely in.  
I havent been taking any medicine just yet	Im curious to know what it really does to your brain	Heyy! Ive been diagnosed with ADHD for 3 years now, but  <e1> I havent been taking any medicine just yet </e1> .  Thinking about it, but before starting anything  <e2> Im curious to know what it really does to your brain </e2> .  I think my point is that why does it work for us and not for people without ADHD or does it?
I	:)	I always feel nervous and I want to cry a lot of the times.  I'd be just sitting there and before I feel dreadful.  I'm so confused. . [Thank you for the thoughtful message.  Its very touching to see it ]( com/cL5Z5Mw)_________Thank you All so much for love and support :)
I'm	well	I'm using just a few things that happen daily as an examplewhen I'm playing a video game, moments come up where I need to react quickly and I just end up panicking .  I'll freeze and then I'll overreact , completely ruining my desired resultIt seems to happen with anything that just requires me to do something really.  My hand ends up jolting when I'm trying to shape a letter correctly or put my finger on a certain guitar string.  Even when I miss clicking the submit button on here I just naturally overcompensate by rushing out some bodily reactionDoes anyone at all have any idea what this could be from? I've just been on edge like this for months now and I can't see my Doctor for another 3 weeks =/  I've noticed that I'm somewhat micro trembling all the time tooOne more thing, I'm literally shaking my foot non stop all day as well
I generally don't know what to do	want to speak to other people going through the same thing	I'm 15 and male.   For the past couple of years I have been battling depression.  I have tried to kill myself twice by drinking mouthwash (I read it was poisonous)  but nothing  worked.   I have been trying to get myself to be happy but can't and now one of my so called friends decided to send an anonymous note to someone I don't even know and I don't know what he wrote.  I am not sure If I will try to die but I think I am ready.   I feel that now I can see that there is no plan for us we are just here the beauty people say they see is just bullshit.     <e1> I generally don't know what to do </e1>  and  <e2> want to speak to other people going through the same thing </e2> .  
I was feeling so anxious	I wanted to throw up	I have depression and anxiety <e1> I was feeling so anxious </e1>   <e2> I wanted to throw up </e2> Took anxiety meds and felt like shit for about 30 minNow it kicked in and now I just feel really sad instead of anxiousFuckFuckFuckWhat is wrong with meI hate mental illnessMakes me so sad
I did pretend to have a glass of champagne for the big toast	I guess I didn't want the stigma that goes with being the one that stopped drinking	It seems everything would be ok if I just had a few drinks . . .  EDIT: just got home, and I made it without drinking!  <e1> I did pretend to have a glass of champagne for the big toast </e1>  ,but my friend and colleague discretely swapped it for his empty one right after.    <e2> I guess I didn't want the stigma that goes with being the one that stopped drinking </e2> .  Thank for all the encouragements! Happy Christmas 
I want to avoid going through my GP	he is absolutely useless	I've been positive that I have Social Anxiety Disorder for several years, but now I feel the need to receive an official diagnosis.  I feel like it could offer me some sort of peace of mind, oddly enough.   <e1> I want to avoid going through my GP </e1> , as  <e2> he is absolutely useless </e2>  (I should get a new one, but that can happen later).  I want to go to someone who actually has a lot of knowledge about anxiety disorders.  I can't afford therapy at the moment, and I'm okay with that, but therapists are basically all that I can find.  Am I missing something? How would I find someone to go to for just an official diagnosis? I live in the Vancouver area, if that matters. Just curious about some of your experiences. 
Hey	snack?	Hey there everyone, happy holidays. Speaking of which I was wondering a out everyone's take on cooking.  I currently live my own and I don't cook big meals I sort of snack around maybe grill a burger one night and I'm also trying to learn about good foods to add into my diet to help with Adhd  any suggestions? Do you cook actual meals or just snack? 
my thoughts race during sex more than any other time	I love sex and I don't want to feel distracted during it	I've had problems with racing thoughts for years, always when trying to fall asleep or if I'm  stressed out.   I've noticed over the past year that  <e1> my thoughts race during sex more than any other time </e1> .    <e2> I love sex and I don't want to feel distracted during it </e2> !   Do any of you have this problem?  Is there something you've found that helps it?Maybe this has nothing to do with my ADD, but it can't hurt to ask.   Background- receiving treatment for clinical depression for ~11 years and receiving treatment for ADD for about 6 months. 
I hate it	I woke up today feeling like I had smoked by receiving second hand smoke	I'm still smoke free after a minor slip up.  It strengthend me to stay on my quit and never let that happen again.  The problem is my partner is starting up again.  First one.  Then two.  Now a box.  And saying the same excuses I use to say.  I will be fine.  I will stop tomorrow.  My main issue is the smell is soooo bad.   <e1> I hate it </e1> .   <e2> I woke up today feeling like I had smoked by receiving second hand smoke </e2> .  I said to my partner no smoking at least 30mins before bed.  I'm worried that it will bring my cravings back or that everyday will become a withdrawal. 
I remembered the stack of books I had unread at home	I was bummed and got nothing	There were so many interesting books on scifi, architecture and art and books about autobiographies, mysteries, and programming.   I was really excited to get something for myself too but I couldn't even finish reading most of the titles and  <e1> I remembered the stack of books I had unread at home </e1> .    <e2> I was bummed and got nothing </e2> .   I guess I just wanted to share some holiday cheer?? 
some bad luck	my credits from my previous school won't transfer	 I have ADD+OCD, I'm pretty effectively medicated (Concerta 27 mg + PRN Ativan) but that's right now, with only my wifing/parenting/household chores.  I'm currently enrolling in the Spring semester at our local community college; I need one more class to qualify as a full-time student &amp; have my tuition coveted by the Pell grant.  My therapist thinks I should take a fluff course to give myself a break.  (My other courses are Composition 1, Intro Algebra, and Anatomy &amp; Physiology 1.  I've taken all these classes before but due to  <e1> some bad luck </e1>   <e2> my credits from my previous school won't transfer </e2> . )I was happy to take a p. e.  course but they're all full, my only other choice is an art appreciation or similar class, I feel like it's wasting my Pell grant but am I setting myself up for failure if I add another difficult class? I am confident I can be a good student but I don't want to bite off more than I can chew.  :/ 
I started to feel anxious	losing almost anything	Hi,  There's something that has always been bugging me a little bit, and in the last couple of month it has become stronger: the fear of losing something that is precious to you.  Most of the times it's things that are still more or less understandable, like being afraid of losing the precious photos I took during a vacation or losing a friendship or a good relationship with someone that I like.   But lately,  <e1> I started to feel anxious </e1>  about  <e2> losing almost anything </e2>  that is somehow good or valuable for me, even when it's highly unlikely that something is going to happen.  For example with making progress: When I (successfully) push my boundaries in a social situation and see myself becoming more and more open and less shy, of course I feel kind of proud, happy and optimistic for the future.  But I also get these negative, doubtful thoughts, like: What if someone rejects me
I'm actually getting excited	I work up the courage to kill myself	I've lost it I've gone completely mad  <e1> I'm actually getting excited </e1>  for when  <e2> I work up the courage to kill myself </e2> 
I'm	problem	I'm 31 years old and I've never talked about this with anyone.  That's kind of hard to believe considering the war I've been through mentally the last few years. I'm going to make this simple as I can.  Ever since I was a kid, going to bed is a process that can take up to 40 minutes in and of itself.  I always knew that needing to shut the door a certain way, or turn the light off in a way that felt right was a problem
He says I can't	when he planned the wedding I was out using and its too late to make changes	My best friend is getting married in late march and he told me I'm invited but I can't be a groomsman.  I didn't talk to him for a couple years in my addiction but he has been an integral part of my recovery these past few months.   <e1> He says I can't </e1>  because  <e2> when he planned the wedding I was out using and its too late to make changes </e2>  but I feel like if he really wanted to he could easily make changes.  I can see where he is coming from, I literally didn't talk to him for two years and his friendships grew with other people but at the same time we go way back.  It just hurts and I'm gonna go to support him, its just gonna be awkward having everyone there asking why I'm not a grooomsman or his best man.  I think I'm being selfish but I don't know.  Shit I don't even know the point of this post, just thinking out loud. . .  
I don't want anything	my life is totally meaningless	All I want is to become unconscious.  In other words, you could say I want to die.  That is all I ever wanted. I am fine but I seriously don't want anything in life at all.  All I want is absolute unconsciousness(like being a chair or an inanimate object).   <e1> I don't want anything </e1>  so  <e2> my life is totally meaningless </e2> .  I don't want to live.  I don't want to move.  I don't want money or material objects.  I don't want to be happy or sad.  I don't want to get better or worse.  I don't want family or friends.  I don't want to eat or sleep.  I don't want to play or work.  I don't want to laugh or cry.  I only want time to go faster so I can be nothing.  I just want to die.  I don't want to commit suicide but I don't want to be conscious.  I don't belong in this world.  What am I going to do with the empty hours before my death?
I know I'm not like other people	I can't do that anymore	I stopped the insanity with the help of the AA community on Jan 1 2000.  I had numerous failed attempts under my belt in the years prior, but on Dec 31 1999, in a bar in Portugal, on holiday I decided to make it stick.  On return to Canada, I began to attend groups regularly and with their help I have returned to life.    I rarely think about alcohol now.    Occasionally I wish I could taste that icy first pilsner my father allowed me to sip out of a cold glass on a hot summer day when I was around 12 or so, but  <e1> I know I'm not like other people </e1> ;  <e2> I can't do that anymore </e2> .  And it's alright with me now.   It wasn't always - I owe my life to the groups I attended. 
right now I've been having a lot of issues with sex	I don't know if it's just because I'm depressed, or if it has something to do with the rape	I was raped in my freshman year of high school.  I'm currently a senior, and I'm finally getting angry about it.  my rapist was a stranger, about 10 years older than me, and he took my virginity.  I ended up switching schools for my sophomore year.  it really fucked up a lot of things in my life.   <e1> right now I've been having a lot of issues with sex </e1> , and  <e2> I don't know if it's just because I'm depressed, or if it has something to do with the rape </e2> , too.  I don't know anything anymore, really.  I'm just tired as fuck.  I can't believe that I was raped.  jesus christ, I wish it had never happened
eating disorder	my attempt to gain control over my variable mood	Hi Everyone, Before I was diagnosed with bipolar 2, I was first diagnosed with anorexia.  Looking back, I realize that my  <e1> eating disorder </e1>  was mostly just  <e2> my attempt to gain control over my variable mood </e2> . I remember hitting periods of depression where it seemed my need to exercise and methodically count calories was the only thing that got me out of bed.  There were also the hypomanic periods where I exercised for several hours straight, cleaned, planned my meal plans down to the last detail, etc.   I've since overcome my eating disorder and have made great strides in dealing with my bipolar as well.  I was just wondering if anyone else had any of the same experiences.  
I'm	sobriety?	I'm sitting here googling strippers for my friends stag party :(I'd forgotten I'd even offered, he approached me yesterday with a nervous grin on his face to remind me.  He said to liaise with the best man, who by the way is super straight-laced.  He describes Oasis as head-banging music.  I can see me ending up having to pay the stripper too.  So much for all the lovely money I've saved not drinking!!Has anyone promised something whilst drunk and had to deliver after entering sobriety? 
its great to not have a hangover today	I am looking forward to feeling even better tomorrow	My first night was probably a little harder than I anticipated, I took the dogs out for plenty of walks and it reduced my cravings. i have to admit  <e1> its great to not have a hangover today </e1>  , and  <e2> I am looking forward to feeling even better tomorrow </e2>  , I have quit for extended periods before and know that I will reach a point where I will be very happy I am sober.  But I'm not there yet! I will not drink today. 
the thoughts will become easy to live with	they wont bother me anymore	So I have been seeing a CBT recently and he wants me to do ERP (Exposure and response prevention) Which basically he tells me when I have a feeling to go do something in my case bless stuff with holy water even though I'm not religious (will explain in another post) that  <e1> the thoughts will become easy to live with </e1>  and  <e2> they wont bother me anymore </e2> .  How does that work? I mean am I just going to not feel anxious with these thoughts anymore as long as I dont do the ritual? is it that easy? hit me back with a reply please people. 
i take every action they do	they don't wanna be my friends anymore	i worry, like. . .  about everything.  i don't if what i have is anxiety or whatsoever.  i'm like. .  actually very open and don't exactly have problem interacting.  but, it's what after that, you know, when those people are friends.  i worry, am i being to annoying. .  am i being too. .  bothersome? they probably don't wanna talk to me? am i just forcing myself on them.  it's very painful.  i overthink everything.  and  <e1> i take every action they do </e1>  as  <e2> they don't wanna be my friends anymore </e2> 
Alright	this.	Alright Reddit, been a pack a day smoker for 4 years now.  I've tried to quit so many times its nuts when i think about it.  I decided to quit today about 4 hours ago, crushed up the remainder of my pack then just now went out side and smoked a broken cigarette.  Its just disgusting what these things do to your mind.  Well, i went outside enjoyed my last puff and now I'm done.  Got a 4litre a water some pop n chips n salsa and tribal wars and the new civ i just bought to tide me over, gunna go full hibernation mode for a few days.  I got this. 
Stinking hot here in Australia 42 degrees today	I kept thinking of dropping by the bottle shop and getting a bottle of nice cold wine	It's the habits that suddenly become hard to ignore.    <e1> Stinking hot here in Australia 42 degrees today </e1>  and for a few hours before I left work,  <e2> I kept thinking of dropping by the bottle shop and getting a bottle of nice cold wine </e2> .   Just one wouldn't hurt.   Fortunately I didn't.   But it bloody annoys me that this happens in my head.   And that I'm still thinking and writing about it.   Does this happen to you?
I would embarrass myself to the extreme	I would be shaking and freaking out waiting for my turn	Reading out loud. I was too anxious to speak to a teacher about it.  But, when it came to reading in class,  <e1> I would embarrass myself to the extreme </e1> .   <e2> I would be shaking and freaking out waiting for my turn </e2> .  It was super obvious how nervous I was as my voice was shaking, I would stumble on every other word.  Christ, I don't even like to think about it.  Please tell me someone else had this problem too.  I used to feel like such an idiot, being the only one that did it. 
So,	term	So, some of you may or may not know my shit.  But basically my meds allow me to sleep, wake up, and suppressed the severity of my cycle.  Beautiful stuff.  But now I've got 8am classes and I don't know if it's because I'm waking up before the sun is up (that's what I feel it is), or I'm just not used to this sleep cycle yet (Never really gotten used to this early of a sleep cycle before, even in highschool when I had 7:30 classes one year) but I've been seriously down in the dumps since yesterday when classes started.  too early I know to say anything for sure but I seriously feel like waking up to no light at all is seriously depressing and may seriously fuck with me this term
he is a lot older and has been clean for a long time	it is innocent	A man I met at my first meeting has been calling me every day more than once a day (I've only been to two meetings so far) and I'm not sure what his intentions are.  I understand members wanting to support newcomers but I'm quite mistrustful of men in general.  I've also seen a lot of posts on here about this topic of being wary of this in meetings.  I assumed because  <e1> he is a lot older and has been clean for a long time </e1>  that  <e2> it is innocent </e2>  but he is calling me quite a lot.  Am I being naive? I know it would be a good time for me to practice being assertive but that is something I have struggled with for a long time.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  
My family never really cared	He's always been negative	When you have a malady that isn't physically visible, people automatically think you're completely monkey balls, and you just want some people in your life who understand what it's like, but no one wants to sit down and understand. I still want to march out into the woods through four feet of snow, barefoot, and let the exposure take me.  It's better than working towards goals that will never happen.  It's better than putting up with all of the stupid expectations that people throw on you.  It's better than waking up everyday and feeling like you don't matter, and you never mattered, to anyone, ever.    <e1> My family never really cared </e1> .   <e2> He's always been negative </e2> 
this is just the first time ive talked about whats going on in my head	it all kinda spilled out	First off im really sorry this is so long. . .  <e1> this is just the first time ive talked about whats going on in my head </e1>  so  <e2> it all kinda spilled out </e2> . Hi.  im 18 and in college.  ive never been clinically diagnosed with depression or bipolar but i do feel that i may have one or both.  and now that i think about it this, the bipolar/depression, may have been present all through my life and it just progressively got worse as life went on. BUT i'm digressing sorry. What i really was going to talk about was these awkward mood swings ive recently been having and wondering if anyone can relate. . . So i know with bipolar you can go from extreme highs to extreme lows.  I can say ive felt the lows

However, I find myself being triggered whenever there is very distressing and violent news on TV.  Last year the Ukranian conflict brought me months of distress and the same has been happening with the Paris shootings over the past week. I want to know if anyone can recommend strategies for dealing with this? 
I	rough	I can smell it and its not even open yet.  This is going to be rough
I've read that drinking loads of water is the way to cure this	I'm already started on that	I've read online that this cough is a common problem with quitting.

I'm curious to ask, if anyone else has tried this and how long it took for you to see results?Thanks everyone.  Keep strong. 
I never really suffered from anxiety in high school	I was an honors student and pretty much got along with everyone that I ended up graduating with	 <e1> I never really suffered from anxiety in high school </e1> .   <e2> I was an honors student and pretty much got along with everyone that I ended up graduating with </e2> .  Then college began.  I remember my first day being nervous as hell and I figured it was just first day jitters or something, but now that feeling never goes away.  I live about 20 minutes of campus and every single morning the closer I get to campus the larger the pit in my stomach becomes.  I don't know why either.  The anxiety has caused some depression as well and also some symptoms of IBS.  I used to think the saying so nervous I could shit myself was a joke

I	However	I do not know if this against the rules but it may be worth saying. . . I called the suicide hotline tonight telling them about the time a few days ago where I stood by the train tracks wanting to end things.  This merited only an indifferent Uh-huh from the person on the other end.  And tonight I relayed my my desires today about laying my head on the tracks  to a seemingly indifferent person.  However
I'm 17, I live on my own	I'm constantly afraid of people breaking in	 <e1> I'm 17, I live on my own </e1> , and  <e2> I'm constantly afraid of people breaking in </e2> . I had a panic attack 45 minutes ago, my mom didn't answer her phone, my boyfriend did and talked for half an hour, and I finally calmed down.  (It's. . . . 4am?)It actually hasn't even been 15 minutes and I'm already shaking uncontrollably and I'm about to vomit.  Again. I don't know how to handle this.  I'm so afraid. 
Right now my life is at a crucial point	a lot is happening and I don't want anxiety to ruin it	Just want to start out saying that anxiety has been a major struggle my whole life.  Within the last year or so, I feel like I have really been dealing with it a lot better, it has almost completely vanished.  Now, within the past few weeks or so, it has suddenly come back full force.  I feel nervous all day, my appetite is small, I get randomly sick, and I can feel my heart beat racing.  I thought I really had it under control without the need for meds, but now I know it can creep back easily.   <e1> Right now my life is at a crucial point </e1> ,  <e2> a lot is happening and I don't want anxiety to ruin it </e2> .  I don't know what I really want out of posting this is, but just getting my thoughts out is somewhat therapeutic.  So if you read this far thank you. 
I	Thanks.	I suffer from depression/anxiety and have done for over 5 years now.  I was wondering if any of you guys ever feel anxious about going to sleep? Any coping techniques? I have tried relaxing music, listening to talk radio but still get very anxious.  Thanks. 
My life sucks	I am lonely, I am poor, and society sucks	 <e1> My life sucks </e1> .   <e2> I am lonely, I am poor, and society sucks </e2> .   The way I see it, I have 3 options:  1) Kill myself.   2) Delude myself into believing society is worth living in  3) Continue being depressed  Even if I manage to be happy, why bother with anything? We all die.  It's all total garbage. 
I don't want to beat myself up about it	that won't help	Well, yeah, you read the title.  Was not my day today.  How do you deal with the boredom? Porn was always my go-to when it comes to being bored and I can't seem to deal with those days where you just don't wanna do anything but you're still bored as f*ck.  But I've got good news as well: I made it through being home alone without screwing up - more than once in the last week.  That's amazing! I was never able to do this - as soon as I heard a door somewhere I was already online searching for something to kill an hour or so.  I didn't want to focus only on the negative and  <e1> I don't want to beat myself up about it </e1>  because  <e2> that won't help </e2> .  This sub already helped me a lot with awesome advice.  Thank you all
Its annoying	dope seems to be the  only thing that gives my life any meaning	 <e1> Its annoying </e1>  because  <e2> dope seems to be the  only thing that gives my life any meaning </e2> , and i think thats why i keep going back to it , over, and over again.  Its all that I have to look forward too, and if I know I dont have any dope to come home to after work it just makes me depressed and all I can think about is how to get the money to aquire it.  I just want to be a normal person again.  The longest time ive been clean was three weeks and other than that little break ive been high everyday for the last 8 months.  How did you find drive after you quit? Maybe I havent tried being clean for a long enough time to be able to start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
This	you.	This isn't me getting off or whatever I am curious if there is a link between masturbation/porn to social anxiety.   So would you say you madturbate daily, weekly, occasionally or not at all? Thank you. 
I relapsed	I mistakenly sipped someone's mixed drink at a party	 <e1> I relapsed </e1> .   <e2> I mistakenly sipped someone's mixed drink at a party </e2> , and as soon as I swallowed my throat burned, my blood ran cold and the 800-pound gorilla had been reawakened.  I brushed it off, and used my mistake as an excuse to kick back a few beers with my friends, and though I had a good buzz going, I couldn't help but notice that something felt off.  I last recall staring into the campfire and the serene mental slowness and loss of physical dexterity that comes with being so drunk you could piss yourself and not know it.  I knew the hangover and headache were on the way
It has helped with my thought process	not thinking of a million things at once	Ive been on Wellbutrin for about a month and a half and at first saw some differences in my mood and anxiety but my inattentiveness was still present.   <e1> It has helped with my thought process </e1>  as far as  <e2> not thinking of a million things at once </e2> .  However I still get distracted easily and not as organized as i want to be.  Ive even implemented reminders, alarms, and a calendar.  I just cant seem to stick with it. I was prescribed Wellbutrin 300mg today, from what ive read online and heard from people is that wellbutrin works better for depression (which i have a mild case of) but not as well for ADHD.  Seems like my Dr.  is started me from the bottom wellbutrin 200mg daily and is gradually raising my dosage.  Im hoping 300mg helps or she prescribes a second med on top of wellbutrin.  Will i see a difference taking 300mg and will i experience side affects like i did when i first started wellbutrin? **EDIT: Title error i meant to say Im on 200mg daily and dosage was raised to 300mg daily**
I	end.	I will.  Best of luck to everyone else.  I don't want anyone but me to die.  In fact nobody but me is allowed to die.  As far as I know, my dying prevents everyone else from dying or being sad for the rest of forever.  The end. 
Family won't help with cost	they say anxiety is bs	I have always had separation anxiety, and have always severely struggled with it.

you don't have to get drunk to have fun	it was such a moment of clarity	Once again I'm inches away from the two week mark.  I've had a few hiccups in maintaining my sobriety but now feels stronger than ever.  Stop drinking is a wonderful place. Last night my wife &amp; I went out with some friends to the casino.  At first I was worried about explaining why I'm not drinking to my friend but luckily, I had an escape route for if anyone offered a drink that I was the DD.  It was a breeze.  I learned last night that  <e1> you don't have to get drunk to have fun </e1>  and  <e2> it was such a moment of clarity </e2> .  Today I'm proud of myself that the reason for my headache is all the cigarette smoke that clogged up my sinuses.  I'm proud I did not drink and went to bed sober.  I'm proud that today I will be productive and enjoy my beautiful Sunday with my amazing wife.  I will not drink today!

M/25/BPI	instability.	M/25/BPI I'm in decent enough shape and I try to exercise regularly, but I started a fairly restrictive diet spin th beginning of December. Its been a good way to keep my alcohol intake in check, but I've noticed that I'm on a much much shorter fuse lately.  My energy is up and down constantly, and there are days where I can get a lot done and others where I can barely move. Also, my therapist is aware of my diet.  She says to keep monitoring it, but that it's prob not the root cause of my instability. 
I	for?	I was prescribed an Adderall generic, Ampheta S/Combo 10mg that Im supposed to take 2x a day.    * What are the best times of the day to take this?  (morning/afternoon?)* The cost is going to be $ 82 for a month's supply.   This seems really expensive to me.   Is this about what I should expect to pay?  I was so happy to finally be taking charge of my ADHD, but now I'm seriously thinking about not going through with this.  * If I do stick with it, it's going to be quite pricey, and along with the inconvenience of making trips to the Doc to get refill prescriptions, should I be rationing it?   in other words, only take it as needed? edit: After reading the instructions that came with it, I think it answers 2 of these questions.  However, I welcome your tips and info.    Anything I should watch out for?

Planning on getting checked soontl;dr: OP wants to know if ADHD can be in amounts of severity/mild and worsen as time progresses
Greetings	x	Greetings Everybody.  I'm on day 2 after smoking daily 13 years + .  I've tried stopping before but always fell back into my old ways.  Found this place a while a ago and just wanted to reach out and say hi.  Stopping to smoke has proved one of the hardest things i have ever had to do but deep down i know it must be done to move on in my life, I want to re posses myself, get me back to shape.  Have been heart warmed to know that i am not alone and others are going through this too, Its all too easy to feel like your 'the only one', I wish you all the best of luck my friends.  Aphrolove x

I was so happy	have someone see that I was not bi-polar	I understand that BPD is a multi-symptom.   I am 36, I was misdiagnosed as Bipolar when I was 18.   I finally found a doctor when I was 27 who realized I am just an energetic smiley person. She diagnosed me Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety, Insomnia, Body Dysmorphic, Eating Disorder not otherwise specified, and Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia.    <e1> I was so happy </e1>  to  <e2> have someone see that I was not bi-polar </e2> .   She gave me 300mg of Wellbutrin, 1mg of klonopinx3, 10mg of ambien, and 100mg of trazadone. Did any of you disregard any of your ailments, and tied them into the BPD diagnosis?  I am now taking the above medicine, along with 225mg of Effexor.   We are charging that to Pristiq (same medicine, cleaner isomer). Just like all sufferers, the criteria that I fit. .  it is like a description of me.   The ones I do not fit, are actually the opposite of me. 
Been	like?	Been depressed for years but lately it just seems like instead of feeling constantly down ( don't get me wrong I still feel blue all the time) I just quickly become angry.  Sometimes over nothing.  Its an uncontrollable anger that just gets worse and worse the more I think about things.  Anyone else know what thats like?
I told him to call me tomorrow	I can find somewhere for him to go back to treatment	Live in halfway, have been for a while.  Got a new roommate, 22 years old.  Seems nice.

He went to a 'meeting' and came home reekin of booze.   <e1> I told him to call me tomorrow </e1>   <e2> I can find somewhere for him to go back to treatment </e2> . He looked me dead in the eye and in the most honest tone said, Dude I dont wanna be sober yet.  And I knew exactly what he meant and how he felt and I been there at his age too.  So I said I hear ya man, be safe, call me if you need. Sigh, just so sad

This has been great	I am getting the sleep I need	It's taken some time to figure out what some of my triggers are.

I have found on the days when I need to get up at a certain time (meetings, etc) the alarm sound, or music, or ringtone (whichever) triggers an anxiety attack.   I have even used my Fitbit vibrate alarm and that does it too, sadly.  I have limited amounts of medication and I'd rather not rely on it when I should be able to find a way to wake up when I need to without it triggering an attack.   Is there any type of app out there that will help you wake up without jolting you out of sleep?

I'm a senior in high school and I don't know what I'm going to do with my life.  I'm not good at anything and I'm not willing to practice to get good at anything.  I hate my life.  I have people offering to talk to me but its so hard for me to just pour it out.  I think I am going to kill myself.

Hey	smoker	Hey guys! I've been a daily smoker for roughly a year now, and an intermittent (once a week or less) smoker for some time before that.   I've felt every day use really exacerbating my natural depression and anxiety when I'm not high.   I found it was easy to cut back to the point of smoking only a couple hits a day, but I don't like the effects marijuana habituation (tolerance?) has on my ability to sleep or eat when I'm not high.   It's been 3 days and I'm feeling clearer and cleaner and happier already! I've decided to quit for the time being, rather than taking a tolerance break like I have in the past.   This may get my post removed, but I'm wondering if you folks have found moderation easier to follow once you've flushed it all out.  Like I said, for a few years I only smoked intermittently and it had no effect on my life like it does now, but this past year my habits have been really bad.   I've never been an all-day smoker
I've	quotes	I've been posting here for about a year now. A lot of the stuff that got me to here, isn't relevant anymore.    All in all, none of the things that hurt me really matter. That said, my life is empty now.  I've got nothing to fill it with either.  If I was told that everything was going to end tomorrow, or next week. . .  or even next month. . .   I can't think of anything I'd want to see or do or try.   I can't even really rely on the stock answers I've given people for those ice breaker questions.   What would you do if you won the lottery?  I think of a lot of quotes
In	you?	In your opinion or research what attributes in a partner combine best with ADHD? I read the small chapter on the subject in Dr.  Hallowell's Delivered from Distraction but felt there was more to be flushed.  Is the compatible SO exceptionally compassionate? Non neurotypical themselves? Are they super laid back so they are not offended by your mental hiccups or they a person who reminds you of things and highly organised? What personality traits have lead to sucessful relationships amongst you?
I	advice.	I have stopped smoking for 5 days so far and I've been deathly ill (slight exaggeration lol) for all of them until today.  5 days ago I was a smoker with severe depression issues, suicidal thoughts and beliefs, drug usage, going no where with my life, and didn't care if i was going to spend it alone until i couldn't take it anymore.  Today is the rest of my life.  I'm going to get help and I'm going to get better.  It starts with bad habits and smoking is the first to go.  Along with it is suicidal thoughts.  No person should have to feel that low, and no one is doing it except me.  Maybe you'll find this little note useful.  If you do, feel free to share anything you want to say.  If anyone knows about beating depression and the nic urges, feel free to give advice.  
nervous	I want it to work more than anything	I have finally been prescribed medicine to help with my ADHD.   My doctor put me on 18mg of Concerta to start and I plan on taking my first dose tomorrow morning (so excited and nervous at the same time,  <e1> nervous </e1>  because  <e2> I want it to work more than anything </e2> )  and I've been reading that taking Concerta and Coffee is not a good idea.   I normally only drink one cup in the morning and maybe some green tea in the afternoon.   I really enjoy my morning cup of coffee and would like to not give it up.   I am looking for advice on both sides.   I'm considering skipping the coffee tomorrow morning just to see how the Concerta does on its own.   UPDATE:  Took my first dose yesterday, with my morning coffee and I did not feel jittery at all.   In fact, I didn't feel much of anything.   I am going to keep taking it, and my doctor wanted me to call in a week, but it seems as if I may need to be bumped up to 27 mg.   Thanks for all the advice!
I'm still alive	missed my artery	I've sat here just staring at my cursor for the last 20 minutes.  I have a problem and I accept my problem.  I don't want help for my problems.  I'm sad and miserable.  A couple of days ago I tried shooting myself.  I could feel the hammer slowly going back.  I was too afraid.  I grabbed the first knife in the kitchen and cut as deep as I could.  To no avail,  <e1> I'm still alive </e1> ! I, unfortunately,  <e2> missed my artery </e2> .  I'm ready to find peace.  Peace of not having to wake up everyday with the dread. . . .  of everything.  Peace in not having this weight on my back.  Peace of no more sleepless nights with the continuous thoughts of every single mistake I've ever made.  When the time is right I will make my apologies to my wife, my parents, and lovely sister.  It went probably won't happen today, tomorrow, or ten years from now, but the day will finally come when I decide to finish that last half of a pull on the trigger.  
I stopped	side effect issues	For several years I have taken Lithium, Welbutrin and Ambien (as well as several medications for heart related issues).  I also took Lamictal up until a few months ago when  <e1> I stopped </e1>  because of  <e2> side effect issues </e2> .  I started taking Abilify just a little over three months ago.  The first couple of months were great, it was as if I'd found a cure.  Then my legs started getting restless and stretching/moving involunarily.  The bad thoughts the medicine had diminished were now replaced with a different kind of negativity.  I feel like I should moving every single moment I'm awake.  It's a combination of restlessness and anxiety that is relentless.  Depression was already beginning to make me apathetic towards things I typically enjoy before I began taking Abilify but now that situation seems to have spread to things that I never thought I'd be ambivalent about (music
I	com/watch?v=ioPLj2IwSus	I was off meds for 4 years.   I finally started back on them in the beginning of January.   However, during the winter break, rather than do something productive I either played computer games, watched shows and movies, or worked on this trance video that seemed like it would be a cool idea at the time.   I'm so glad I'm back on medication.   Anyways, here's the video that I'm referring to.   All I did was take some trance and house songs and put them together with some cool photographs: youtube. com/watch?v=ioPLj2IwSus
I'm starting a job in a call center on February 16, and they don't allow smoke breaks	I need to be able to work a 6-8 hour shift without heading out to smoke, where as currently that is 4 separate breaks of 2 cigs each	 <e1> I'm starting a job in a call center on February 16, and they don't allow smoke breaks </e1> .  I've been smoking about over half a pack a day for over a year now (not long after I turned 18).   <e2> I need to be able to work a 6-8 hour shift without heading out to smoke, where as currently that is 4 separate breaks of 2 cigs each </e2> .  Also, the girl I've been chatting up has asthma and won't be around me if I'm smoking. This isn't my first attempt, and the longest I've made it before is cutting down to 2 cigarettes a day for a month or 4 days with no smoking. I have motivation this time and am hopeful for some better results. 
Ugh,	Well	Ugh, I've been handling my anxiety quite well for the past year, up until now where I'm required to work in remote locations for up to 3 weeks at a time.  I've had heaps of time in my own head up here and I just can't get over these intrusive thoughts. . . I've always been afraid that one day i'll become psychotic.  I understand that if i were truly psychotic that i probably wouldn't realize.  As much as I can grasp that, my scum bag brain progresses to make me feel like: Well
Last	best.	Last year all I wanted to do was get fucked up during the game.  this year it didn't even cross my mind.  Just came here to say it gets easier with time.  Stay strong y'all.  You guys are the best. 
This	dissapear.	This is the first time I've been able to post here, I'm bulimic and self harm a lot.  I havent done anything serious in about two weeks although today she's really flipping out and im breaking down.  i dont want to cause anything bad that'll make me really do something horrible but i feel like the only way to calm down without my adhd medicine is to cut myself.  i dont know what to do.  i want to just dissapear. 
My	health.	My anxiety problems started about a year ago and ever since I just can't shake the constant thought that something is wrong with my heart.  Any chest pain or quick heart beat and I think I'm going to have a heart attack.  The only thing I have  anxiety issues I have are with my own health.  I'm always fearful something is seriously wrong with my health.  
my anxiety	it's keeping me from doing certain things that I otherwise would like to do	For years now I've been plagued with anxiety and panic attacks.  I shared that once and very briefly with a friend but I can't hide it any longer.  I'd really like to talk to some of my close friends about  <e1> my anxiety </e1>  and how  <e2> it's keeping me from doing certain things that I otherwise would like to do </e2> .  I just don't know how. I've made huge progress since my first panic attack but in the past few months, I feel like I'm not making any progress and I think it's time to seek outside help.  I've actually been trying to muster the courage to consult the school psychologist for a while now but it's so freaking hard to do! At night all I can think of is the next day and how I'm finally going to make it but then the day comes and I just nervously avoid thinking about it. I feel like s/he will say how can I help you? And I'll just freeze. Can you share your experiences about telling your friends or family for the first time and also about the very first session with a mental health professional please?Thank you very much for your time
i dont dare to go to the mall or anywhere where people are	im just afraid everyone looks at me and thinks i look stupid and ugly	i cant talk to people in my normal voice i talk super quietly and i cant talk to girls at all. . .  its frustrating.  also im either home or at my families,  <e1> i dont dare to go to the mall or anywhere where people are </e1> . . . .   <e2> im just afraid everyone looks at me and thinks i look stupid and ugly </e2> . . .  
Silver Linings Playbook disappointed many of us with its depiction of (possible) bipolar disorder	With the help of the internet, I found this master list of bipolar disorder in fiction!	 <e1> Silver Linings Playbook disappointed many of us with its depiction of (possible) bipolar disorder </e1> .   <e2> With the help of the internet, I found this master list of bipolar disorder in fiction! </e2>  So, to whom it may concern:[Bipolar disorder in fiction]( wikipedia. org/wiki/Category:Bipolar_disorder_in_fiction)Note: I haven't even scratched the surface of these, so maybe they're as disappointing as Silver Linings Playbook, haha. 
Why	understand?	Why is it that every time I go and detox from this shit I get these nasty vertigo episodes? Really wtf. I'm on a fent patch low low dose and i take 15mg of morphine and I'm still like zipidy do da I'm gonna fall down the stairs. . Is there some kind of science behind this? Or somthing I just understand? 
i feel like i should skip this and suck it up for a few weeks	i don't want to change drinking dependence to sleep aids	like most of you, i didn't find day one to be too terrible.  day two is about the same so far.  last night i worked late (i am a crossfit instructor in the evenings) and didn't even get around to dinner until 9.  usually i would have delayed dinner in order to drink some wine, but i just got right to it.  then i made some tea after dinner and sipped that on the couch.  bonus points? i actually remember what we watched on TV.  this morning i woke up groggy but i didn't feel too sick.  i've been foggy all day, is that normal? also, i used a sleeping aid last night, but upon reflection,  <e1> i feel like i should skip this and suck it up for a few weeks </e1> , because  <e2> i don't want to change drinking dependence to sleep aids </e2> .  how long was it until you started sleeping again? even just a few hours? the worst part is falling asleep.  my head is racing and i find i am actually anxious about getting to sleep, which is probably keeping me up.  tips? 
I	DUI	I went in this morning to complete my evaluation.  It was court ordered and I got it in just in time.  I'm a procrastinator :/ The lady was really nice and made me feel comfortable which was good.  There was a lot of paperwork that I had to read and sign and she spent a long time filling out forms on the computer.  She asked me the typical questions about how much I (used to) drink, past drug use, if I think i'm an alcoholic etc. . . . I answered a few questions and she said, you know what you just described? and I said an alcoholic.  She said that was right.  I ended up being very open and completely honest throughout the evaluation.  I was on the fence about whether or not to lie my way through it.  I'm really glad I didn't.  At the end of the session she said that her recommendation would be her DUI seminar.  It's 16 hours over the course of two weekends and $ 250.  It turns out since I ended up with a reckless driving and not a DUI
Does	think?	Does anyone else have the problem of if being asked a question which they know the answer to, cannot answer it because suddenly your brain just goes quiet and is like 'nope'? Or if you try really hard to recall something your brain is just empty you cant find anything in there? Or you forget what you're saying midsentence and cannot pull it back out of your mind? i dont know if it's an adhd thing or just a panicking under pressure thing, what do you guys think?
Think	fuck.	Think about it.  All of your problems come from inside your head.  You are your own worst enemy.  It's easy to fight against an outside force, as long as your mind is strong and intact.  But if it's your own mind tearing you down from the inside, that's a lot harder to fight.  I feel like I may have gone too long without doing anything about my anxiety, and now it's irreversible.  Just a rant.  No throwaway because who gives a fuck. 
I've	like	I've been sober three months now and have been going to meetings nearly daily most of that time.  I'm trying to take AA seriously and am doing what I can to keep an open mind, but, like many atheists, I'm having some issues with the god part.  Specifically, I'm not sure how to talk with my sponsor about it. Now I have read AA and 12&amp;12, and I'm aware the official position is that someone seeking sobriety can conceive of a higher power in any form they like
Now I'm in a position professionally where I see a great number of patients a day and I need to be energetic and lively	I got off the medication	Here's my situation.   I've been on Adderall before when I was in the thick of professional school.   I think my dosage might have been a bit high, but it basically helped me get through my studies well.  Physically, however, I didn't want to do much but sit, study, and think.  <e1> Now I'm in a position professionally where I see a great number of patients a day and I need to be energetic and lively </e1>  so  <e2> I got off the medication </e2> .   However I'm about to make a huge move and buy a business.  This requires an enormous amount of organization and focus to ensure that I'm making all of the right decisions and taking over this practice with my best foot forward. So, what do I do in this situation?  Should I just persevere without medication as I have the past few years or should I explore my options and see what works.   Can anyone with a similar situation give me some pointers on the different types of medications and their effects on your working life when you need to be active?
Though	stopdrinking	Though life has been kicking my ass for years now I have held steady and today I have 19 years clean and sober (4 and a half with cancer).  If nothing else when I die I will at least have beaten my addictions ass.   Not bragging (OK bragging a little but mostly trying to encourage those that are just trying to get clean and sober)  Cross post to Alcoholism &amp; stopdrinking
Is	Thoughts?	Is this typical with Adderall or any other stimulants? Im usually never this cranky.  Today I even have less focus than before and the calm period lasted briefly after this morning's dose.  It's possible I'm just having a bad few days, or that it's a female thing (although I never had PMS mood swings my whole life) but I feel like the last three days have been spent being irritable and cranky.   Thoughts? 
So	something?	So I have alwayes had lessened emotions and I blame it on my ADD.  this is never really a problem, in fact I usually count it as a good thing except when I actually do feel emotions and I never act like it. The problem im facing at the moment is that I have been going on a few dates with this friend recently, I really like her and I really think she likes me back but its obvious that she can never tell when I like something.  An example is that today we were watching a movie and she cuddled up to me, after a while I put my arm round her and we just kinda sat there wathing the rest of the movie.  I really enjoed it obviously but afterwards I found out from a mutual friend that she got really worried that I wasnt into it, or that I thought it was too soon for that:P.  I dont really know what I did to make her think that but does anyone with this lack of emotion have any tips for how to express to someone that im enjoying something?
I	sense.	I am 20 years old in college.  Every day I dread going to school, dread getting out of bed.  I am bored all the time and feel helpless about it.  I exercise every day and I also have a chronic illness that affects me all the time.  I genuinely have no friends at my school, I feel alone even though there are many people around.  I thought about suicide once, but I realized how awful that would be for my family and it really is not worth it.  I don't know if these feelings of being worthless and lazy are normal or I am depressed.  I am unmotivated to do homework, go to school, to do anything really.  Can someone help me find out what is wrong so that I can get help or fix it? Thanks for reading, sorry if it doesn't make much sense. 
Disclaimer:	Yeah	Disclaimer: I may be completely wrong about all of this.  I'm just trying to get the record set straight.  I think that suicidal thoughts and the state of being suicidal, while related, are completely different.  One is the call of the void, the other is a very real, immediate danger that one is tragically capable of putting oneself in. I suspect that every depressed person thinks about killing themselves.  However, that's relatively far off from acting upon those thoughts.  Me personally? Yes, I'm depressed.  Yes, I have passing thoughts of suicide.  However, I recognize that I am mentally ill and that suicide would be the ultimate mistake.  Despite having thoughts, I present no harm to myself or others.  The catch is that most people who tell others that Yeah
I	self-harm.	I know those two subjects are different from each other but has anyone else been through this.  It usually goes something like this. Someone or something makes me angry, i'll punch everything around me, then the tears will come because i'm mad at myself for being mad (Are you confused yet?), then the negative thoughts rush to my head and finally i self-harm. 
What	say	What is the truth? I'm in the darkUncertain hang-ups in my wayTo fend me from a swim with sharksA helpful thing--but go away!. You see the hang-ups very wellMight be mere lies and half-truthI'd rather have full truth to quellMy cravings that are uncouth. And these sharks would not eat me wholeI've swum with them many a timeThey only nibble little holesThe whole affair is all sublime!. Oh, yes, I bleed a little bitAnd get an ear infectionBut I can't stop when urges hitTis' inborn predilection. So seagulls love to feed me bitsOf white-washed tales and gossipSaying shark bellies go on the spritzFrom human flesh, so stop it!. Here now you see the pickle caseThat picks my mind--it's crazy!I do not know what to embraceThe cautious or the lazy. I tend to err on caution's side(I lost a leg to rashness)But when this urge and I collideI lose myself to brashness. This cabin fever rocks my mindIt drives me up the mastThe midday sun it makes me blindMy breaking point it drives me past. I want to swim with sharks again!But golly! I know better!If you relate please say
I've	sucks.	I've been doing pretty well these past few months.  It has been a little over 4 months since the incident and the hospitalization.  I got the bill today and had to sit down on the kitchen floor to stop myself from freaking out.  I'm not going to pretend to be some health system/ insurance expert.  I realize that the technology and science necessary to create medicine and treatment are expensive and yada yada yada.  I'm not trying to start a revolution or anything. I just think it would have been a lot cheaper to toss myself off of the bridge.  And that kinda sucks.  
Why	sorry.	Why can't I bring myself to do it? I think about it every day and yet being the coward I am I can't fucking do it.  I want to so bad but I'm afraid of my own blood and I'm afraid of pain.  I'm afraid of hell if it exists.  I don't want to be alive.  I can't drive a mile down the road without tightening my grip on the wheel and imagining myself careening off the side of the road.  There's no point in me.  There is literally no god damn reason for me to have even existed in the first place.  Fuck this body.  Fuck these cells.  Fuck this brain.  Fuck this fucking. . .  I don't even know.  God damn it.  God fucking damn it.  This is the only place I can vent because I don't have anybody who cares.  I'm sorry. 
I keep putting it off	I feel normal during the day	Well here I am in bed having another panic attack.  I managed to fall asleep with out one, but I woke up to that familiar feeling that my heart was going to beat out of my chest and a horribly overwhelming anxious feeling.  Now I am laying here trying not to hyperventilate or get up and wake my girlfriend.  This horrible feeling of doom just won't go away.  I feel like at any moment I am going to pass out or loose my mind.  Today I need to make a doctors appointment.   <e1> I keep putting it off </e1>  because  <e2> I feel normal during the day </e2> .  Sigh.  Why can't this end.  
The only thing that makes me feel happy	being with someone else	I cant find happiness in anything that I try to do.   Even if I am good or talented at something, it just doesnt mean anything.    <e1> The only thing that makes me feel happy </e1>  is  <e2> being with someone else </e2> , because the last time I was happy was with my girlfriend.   The girl I like now had sex with one of my good friends, even though he knew how much I cared about her.   I just dont want to live a life alone, without happiness. 
Hi	focusing!	Hi everyoneI have a tough time focusing at work.  Typically, my attention span lasts about 10 minutes before I have to get up, do something else, surf the net, etc.  I am a huge music lover, and have found the band, The Mars Volta, to really keep my brain active enough where I can focus for hours on end.  I'm sure it is the music type, and not just the band, but for those looking for cool new music, it's a great place to start.  Happy listening, and hopefully, happy focusing! 
my problems	only makes my inability to feel happy worse	I've been depressed for many years, and it goes through cycles.   I've been in a pretty low place since last summer when I had a big career change. . . I know that  <e1> my problems </e1>  are pretty minor/stupid compared to many other people, which  <e2> only makes my inability to feel happy worse </e2> . I've never considered conducting suicide, or even really contemplated how to do so, though I've always thought a lot about death (I am afraid of dying). What I am beginning to realize though is that I think I am trying to kill myself slowly by eating lots of crap.   Whenever I feel down, I will go out of my way to eat really unhealthy food (often I don't really even want to eat it), but its sort of like a way to punch myself for being a piece of shit.  I wonder if anyone else has gone through this or seen studies on this type of self-harm.   Its really damaging my health and I've gained 20 pounds in a few months because of it.  
She is leaving me	all my past lying	Being that I'm breaking up with my girl and leaving my apartment, I've been packing up some of my stuff.   Just found a stash of like 50 tramadol, 2 blues, and some norcos.   Looked at it for a long time, felt sad, felt weird, but I did not want it.   Still, I stared at that bag, just stared at it.   And then I flushed it.    <e1> She is leaving me </e1>  because of  <e2> all my past lying </e2> , she is just burnt out on the situation.   For a split second I wanted to tell her and be like, look at what I just did
I'm embarrassed	I watch porn	Today I've had 3 or 4 wanks.  Some out of boredom, some out of horniness.  All stimulated by porn.  I've wasted 2 or 3 hours of my day and I've decided that I've had enough.  I quit porn today, the 14/02/15, for good.  And I mean it.  It's a waste of time.  It cripples motivation to do actually useful stuff.  I got a gym membership this term but have barely used it, despite my grand plans to change my body.  It's disgusting.   <e1> I'm embarrassed </e1>  by the fact  <e2> I watch porn </e2> , it's perverted. And many many other reasons besides.  Here goes.  
**Update---	Thanks	**Update--- I feel great! Thx for the help.  Just due to the unpredictability of withdrawals I guess.  Also i was very dehydrated. .  basically a hungover feeling.  Pounding water and gatorade has helped a lot.  I'm lucky that I haven't had nausea through this process.  8 full days down!Hello.  I had a 3 year off and on habit of PST.  I've tapered off before and quit during those three years.  This is currently the longest I've been away from the PST.  I tapered down to next to nothing (about 1/10th) of the usual dose, and then its been 7 days since then. Shouldn't I be turning some corner? I feel worse than I did on days 1-6 at day 7! Also - I tried Kratom, and it did NOTHING.  wondering what I did wrong.  Any feedback would be great.  I've never been to this part of reddit before, but I'm desperate.  Thanks
the extended brakes from smoking	lowered my tolerance and cravings	So, i'll quit and then have to reset my badge.  I've been having to do this a few times, but i've noticed  <e1> the extended brakes from smoking </e1>  has really  <e2> lowered my tolerance and cravings </e2> .  People talk smack about weaning off instead of cold turkey, but that's how my parents quit apparently, and i've never seen them smoke a cigarette in my life. . .  So, is it such a bad method?
I've	experience.	I've found that often times when I go to tell a story or try to explain something to someone, I'm basically talking without thinking.  Then I usually realize after I finish talking that I probably made no sense or was really scattered.  I was wondering if anyone else had this experience.   I've never been diagnosed but I've suspected for a while, and even if I did I wouldn't be sure it had anything to do with adhd.  I'm just curious your experience. 
My	years.	My father got back from his 2nd 5 months alcohol recovery, he is a 56 year old alcoholic.  I had the worst periods of my life with him while being drunk, but now i see his sober face again and he looks happy but let's just hope that he will try to resist the urge , the doctors told us , with 50% cirosis of the liver if he gets submitted for the 3rd time to recovery it might be game-over for him , or he could stay there for the treatment for a long period of time (2-5 years) or the worst scenario to die from alcohol in the next 1-2 years . . .  Wish me luck and the strength to endure what I've endured for my 22 years. 
I'm fairly certain methylphenidate/amphetamine based drugs	fail	Hello all,So, I'm going to be applying for a new job here shortly, and some of the places do drug tests.   <e1> I'm fairly certain methylphenidate/amphetamine based drugs </e1>  will cause me to  <e2> fail </e2> . What do I do? Who do I tell? HR? The person handling my resume? What do I tell them? I know they're barred from not hiring people for having ADHD, but. . . I'd rather tell them I have a disability later rather than sooner. Advice?
I don't think you have ADHD	People with ADHD are usually from a broken home	I finally went to see my doctor today to try and confirm or deny my long lasting suspicion that I might have ADHD. The first thing I got was the line Thats usually something a parent would ask about their child said to me as if it was strange for an adult to have ADHD.  I found this kind of reaction incredibly odd. Then I was asked the following questions:Do you have siblings? : YesDo you get along with them?: YesDo you have pets?: YesDo you get along with them?: YesDo you have a good relationship with your parents?: YesHave you ever been in trouble with the law?: NoDo you ever physically lash out in an aggressive manner: NoThen I was told  <e1> I don't think you have ADHD </e1> .   <e2> People with ADHD are usually from a broken home </e2>  (my doctor makes an assumption on my family on the basis of me telling her I have a civil relationship with them) Or get in trouble with the law for anti social behaviour. These observations may be true statistically
Some of my family members went to  ritalinaddiction. com/ (website not working for me atm)	got freaked out a bit especially with heart damage and other things	Hello everyone,I just got diagnosed with ADHD-PI and have been put on Ritalin at low doses; 5mg 3x a day.  I woke up this morning and took my first pill and after 30 mins spent an hour cleaning my room.  I been meaning to do that for a month now.  I was just wondering what the current health status or situation is for Ritalin use; in particular its side effects especially long-term.  <e1> Some of my family members went to  ritalinaddiction. com/ (website not working for me atm) </e1>  and  <e2> got freaked out a bit especially with heart damage and other things </e2> . Just wanted your input in this matter.  Also anyone know if it is safe to use Asthma puffer with Ritalin?Thank you!EDIT: Also I have noticed that I have this feeling of having to manage my own breath, like I feel like I am consciously breathing, not sure if this is a side affect, or just my anxiety or brain adjustment to the drug. 
For	this?	For some time now I get a bit drowsy before noon.  Perhaps it's the Gabapentin kicking in, but without it it still happens at times. Say I took adderall around 7 am.  I eat at 8:15 am and take Gabapentin for anxiety.  Around 10:30 I start to get drowsy and really want to nap, however the adderall is preventing this. Around 11:15 I can't resist it.  I try to get into a comfortable position and sleep it off.  Then I get twitches/spasms.  Big ones.  Out of nowhere my head will jerk left and my body will shake for a duration of less than 1 second.  If I put my head down my legs will kind of kick me up and my torso, again, shakes.  It's like my body is one of those emergency, self-inflatable rafts being opened and ***poof***, just like that I shoot out and stop. Anyone else experience this?
Hello	suggestions?	Hello all,I was reading through and commenting on an interesting conversation when the OP brought up that they are depressed and suicidal.  Now that I know this, I don't feel like I can just leave them be, but I don't know how to respond.  [Here are some of the concerning comments for context. ]( reddit. com/r/casualiama/comments/2wg775/i_havent_left_my_apartment_in_a_year_ask_me/coqzx6v?context=3)I don't know this person, and they seem rather resistant to getting any kind of help.  I honestly don't know what to do with a stranger on the internet like this.  Any suggestions?
I'm kind of worried	my therapist says that it's quite possible that my relationship could flip, turn upside down if I don't start taking care of myself	Okay, so I've been going to a therapist where I live for depression and anxiety.  I had an appointment today and she highly suggested (read: damn near ordered) I look into a local book club or some other social activity. Well, I looked around for some local social doodads, but came up empty.   <e1> I'm kind of worried </e1>  because  <e2> my therapist says that it's quite possible that my relationship could flip, turn upside down if I don't start taking care of myself </e2>  (Loooong story. . . ). Anyway, I guess I'm asking for suggestions or something.  I love to read and write in the science fiction genre, play video games and RPGs.  The thing is, I'm in a super small town and there's really not a whole lot going. Any suggestions or ideas would be absolutely appreciated!
I	now.	I have struggled with drugs for a long time.  Ive gone through a lot of ups and downs in my life and had to start over a few times. This time everything has been going good for about a year I have a decent job that pays the bills and makes me happy but I have no friends at all.  For the last few months I have started using again and spending all my extra money every time I get paid.  Then I realized I had access to a family members bank account and used their money too.  Finally they just realized and I don't know what to do now. 
Im going to be quitting soon	while kratom may act similarly to opiates, it absolutely affects much more	 <e1> Im going to be quitting soon </e1>  because  <e2> while kratom may act similarly to opiates, it absolutely affects much more </e2> .  My guess would be dopamine, gaba, norepinephrine, and epinephrine and even more.  Have you also noticed successful up regulation? This worries me as well.  God I was stupid to get hooked on this. What worries me the most is gaba and adrenaline and motivation and permanent down regulation. This also explains why it takes patience and time to recover.  
I	earlier!	I stuck to all my goals today: physical therapy, called my sponsor and left a message about my 90 in 90 plan, called another alcoholic and left a similar message, spent my 20/10 cleaning time clearing the sink of dirty dishes, and did a German language lesson on babbel.  And, most importantly, made it to a meeting! An 11pm meeting after work (bartender here!) but still, made a meeting in this 24 hour time period (last meeting I made it to was on Wednesday) and even raised my hand and shared about the depression and my 90 in 90 proposed solution.  I'm pretty proud of that, considering now my feet are wet from the slush puddles that form on every corner and I'm starving.  Lesson learned: new waterproof boots are a priority and bring a snack tomorrow! Self-care Rose, self-care!I realize this is all new and I'm still feeling really inspired to keep to my plan.  But I'm going to hold onto that and build as much momentum as I can.  Thanks everyone for the encouragement earlier! 
Someone	do?	Someone I love was talking about suicide last night, and the last time we talked was at 4:00AM this morning.  I haven't been able to contact this person today at all, and I'm worried she might have done something drastic.  She's been considering suicide for a few weeks now, and I've been trying to stop her from doing it.  If she's not at school tomorrow, I'll assume the worst.  What should I do?
they don't know how old I am	I ignore or avoid it the two or three times it's come up	I've been alone most of my life.  I had a falling out with my only real friend a long time ago, but I've come to terms with it.  Most of my interactions come through imageboards, but in the last month or so, I've started an IRC channel with a group of people.  I really like them all, and I truly appreciate the chances I have to interact with them, but there's one thing that's been nagging at the back of my mind.  I'm seventeen, and most of them are between nineteen and twenty-three.  Obviously,  <e1> they don't know how old I am </e1> , because  <e2> I ignore or avoid it the two or three times it's come up </e2> .  It just makes me uneasy that the only way I'm able to be friends with them is because I'm being dishonest in a way.  Obviously
felt disgusted and ashamed	I had caved so easily	Day 5 here and I had a vivid dream that I relapsed last night.  Some sketchy dealers (not my actual dealer or anyone I know in real life) were near my house and somehow, I ended up getting a fat pre-rolled joint from them.  I smoked a bit of it and immediately  <e1> felt disgusted and ashamed </e1>  that  <e2> I had caved so easily </e2> .  Didn't even feel high.  I ended up throwing out most of the j in my dream lol. When I woke up, I was so relieved to realize it had only been a dream! Feeling stronger as a result! We can do this guys! EDIT: I thought about it a bit more.  Here's my analysis:Sketchy unknown people = Subconscious rejecting the part of you that was a slave to trees, considering that part foreignPre-rolled joint = The deceptive ease of escaping from real issues through smoking weed all day everydayThrowing it out and disgust = Your subconscious directing you to shake the habit for good
I	do	I was really depressed for a long time.  A year ago, around this time, I got put in a psych hospital.  I always had this weird thing where I got all anxious when it got close to bedtime, and I'm so uncomfortable and I don't want to sleep alone, and my mind went 1000 miles an hour and I'd lay there on the verge of tears for no reason until I passed out.  It's coming back and I barely sleep and I don't know what to do
I'm just miserable	My mind is filled with so much I want to talk about, yet when I go to type it out I just. . . can't	 <e1> I'm just miserable </e1> .   <e2> My mind is filled with so much I want to talk about, yet when I go to type it out I just. . . can't </e2> .  I havn't been to 2 of my college classes in 3 weeks, and the rest I'm not putting any work into.  Ever since Iv'e started college 3 semesters ago Iv'e been a mess. I can't focus, or concentrate on anything anymore and I'm finding it harder and harder to get out of bed in the morning.  I feel like I don't have an identity.  I just need someone to help me figure out how to be happy again. 
I just didn't know how to respond to him	I've been under this haze for such a long time	I'm not sure whether I should be frustrated or glad that my friend did what he did.  I've been depressed for years and while we were working together, I had my first and only mental meltdown.  I just burst into tears when all the customers left and my then new coworker asked me about my plans for the future.   <e1> I just didn't know how to respond to him </e1>  because  <e2> I've been under this haze for such a long time </e2> .  I've been planning my suicide for almost as long.  We've become good friends since. Now that the day is approaching, I guess he noticed I've been acting a little strange and detached.  I don't speak his native tongue but I knew that he was planning something.  He asked me if I was going somewhere soon.  I lied and told him that I'm going on vacation soon, but I suspect that he knows what I'm really going to do.  Rather than trying to persuade me individually, he gets all of our mutual friends to blow up my phone and attempt to cheer me up.  How's it going man? ____ told me you were depressed recently
Does	Thanks.	Does anyone have a different way of organizing tasks and to-do lists?At my job, I get a lot of requests for marketing materials and admin.  assistant tasks.  Most of the time, department managers just pop into my office and tell me they need this and that done by this day and time.  I write it down in a notebook. My problem is this: I can't always remember to look at my notes.  Sometimes I take so many notes in a day that I have to look back through pages and pages of notes and things slip through the cracks. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks. 
I	chugger?	I know this sub is for real addictions, sorry.  10 days without caffeine and sleeping like a god, with steady energy throughout the day.  Anyone else a reformed coffee chugger?
I can hopefully make it through	it's already been pushed back once by inclement weather	Out of nowhere I was hit like a train last night with these incredibly awful stomach cramps.  They kept me up 4 hours longer than I meant to be, woke me up 2 hours early, and are so bad I just went and dry-heaved for 20 minutes.  I'm 100% sure it's stress related and I have no idea how to make it stop.  I have a test at 1:30 this afternoon that  <e1> I can hopefully make it through </e1> , because  <e2> it's already been pushed back once by inclement weather </e2> . If anybody has any tips for relaxing and calming the stomach please let me know, I'm desperate right now. 
I am getting pretty hopeless	I am and always have been used to being able to visit friends whenever I wanted	Hello! I have been struggling with anxiety for 8 years now (first panic attack when I was 10).  For about a half year now, I've developed Agorophobia (Fear of leaving the house, I'm glad school is 5 minutes away from where I live:).  So yeah, I have been visiting a therapist for about 3 months now.  I usually try to battle the agorophobia several times a week, with taking the bus to my city, where my therapist is.  The thing is, I don't feel like I am getting any better.  I would say that it's a 50/50 chance that I will end up screaming for help in the middle of the bus out of panic, feeling like I am going to die.   <e1> I am getting pretty hopeless </e1> , as  <e2> I am and always have been used to being able to visit friends whenever I wanted </e2> , or go for a walk whenever I feel like it, but now I'm basically stuck in between the house's 4 walls.  Anyone that has any stories/tips on how they got rid of their Agorophobia?
I	/r/depression	I was diagnosed with depression last year But I was able to get help.  I was on the right track to recovery but now it's back.  I was accepted into college but two classes might ruin that.  My math class is way too hard and the teacher won't help me.  I was lucky enough to barely pass the first semester but now I'm failing again.  I've tried to get help from him but I get extremely nervous in front of him.  And my economic class is the fucking worst.  The teacher constantly forgets to put grades in and there's even evidence he purposely lowers grades.  My friend if I can even call him that didn't do his part in a big project which doomed me to fail this gradimg period.  I don't want anything to do with him anymore.  Today I almost had a panic attack in school.  After I stopped it I decided if I don't graduate I might kill myself.  I also posted in /r/depression
need to visit therapist and psychiatrist	my brain is ROTFLOLWTFBBQ squirrel where am i	TL:DR - might be having seizures, still adhd,  <e1> need to visit therapist and psychiatrist </e1>  because  <e2> my brain is ROTFLOLWTFBBQ squirrel where am i </e2> ?So, as it stands, I have more questions than answers.   I went to my neurological exam, and I think I have new clue what the fuck is going on anymore! Next Wednesday I have testing for seizures, and she also referred me back to the therapist, and a psychiatrist  with quite a bit of urgency.  I for sure have ADHD with out any question, but she is afraid of what may lie deeper.  Also, they are afraid I might be on the spectrum. .  Yay. .  Also my relationship is now almost completely fucked. . .  Yay again. . 
my eye sight isn't the greatest and my eyes can feel quite strained when I'm tired which is quite often	the time that I have to wake up at for work	I'm kind of embarrassed saying this, but  <e1> my eye sight isn't the greatest and my eyes can feel quite strained when I'm tired which is quite often </e1>  because of  <e2> the time that I have to wake up at for work </e2>  (just before 6AM) and I've noticed that my eyes drift when there are distractions. . . for instance, if someone gets up or sits down mid conversation to talk my eyes drift when I don't want them to. . or when I hear the sound of shoes click-clack I try very hard to stay focused which is quite difficult to me. . and sometimes my eyes drift to certain body parts when I'm not actually interested and want to continue maintaining eye contact. . or another example if someone's sitting and there's a lot of gap between their arm and their chest. . I try very hard to maintain eye contact, but it's not the easiest thing with ADHD and I'm very sensitive and don't want to seem like I'm interested in people or staring at them inappropriately. . any tips for dealing with this awkward situation?  I don't want to seem like a creep especially because it tends to happen in situations when it shouldn't. 
I'm so sad and so exhausted	my medication	I don't know what to do.  It's so crowded.  Every time I focus on the voices they're loud, every time I let my guard down and try to relax, they're loud.  There is no escaping.  I am their God and I'm a scared God and I think I have to listen to them now.  I can't tell *anyone* in real life.  They wouldn't understand.  They'd hate me.  They wouldn't know the difference.   <e1> I'm so sad and so exhausted </e1>  from  <e2> my medication </e2>  and I'm just ready to blow my brains out.  Wish I had a gun. 
it didn't matter	I joined infantry	I'm a 24 year old married male.  Over the past year I've started losing hope.  From as early as I can remember I've always drawn the short stick.  I was the worst student in the worst classes, I was always on the losing team of everything, scored horribly low on ACT/SAT, joined the Marines, scored horribly low on ASVAB but  <e1> it didn't matter </e1>  cuz  <e2> I joined infantry </e2> , I was in the worst platoons in the worst companies, the worst squad in the platoon, never really been accepted by my peers, never really knew myself or who I was, upon leaving the military every university I applied to denied me, now I'm going to a community college, my wife is a drunk and when she goes out idk if she's dead or sucking dick, I have zero self confidence, my new job isn't difficult but I guess my personality just isn't interesting enough for people to accept me, I've lived all my life with anxiety and some depression, my family says I have a flat affect and lately I've been having suicidal thoughts

I moved out	lose all sense of responsibility	Hello /r/ADHD,I've run into some trouble due to my ADHD.  I'd like to share my story.  I'm a biomedical engineering student in freshman year.  College is harsh but up until recently I managed.  What happened? Well,  <e1> I moved out </e1> .  Dutch colleges don't have dormitories so students have to find housing themselves.  This change has made me  <e2> lose all sense of responsibility </e2> .  I stopped going to my classes.  I stopped doing my homework.  Basically all I did was lay in bed and watch TV. Now I have two intermediate tests coming up.  I started studying but I didn't understand anything.  I panicked, quit and now I don't know what to do. Not sure what good will come of posting this but maybe writing down the problem will help me fix it.   
almost slit my wrist but stopped myself	I thought there might be a chance for us to stay together	For a lot of that year though I've been in a relationship with a really wonderful girl.  My first serious relationship, also the girl I lost my virginity to. I've been suicidal but able to push it back for the most part.  However, this girl and I split up last week and for the past week I've been shattered.  I want to lay in bed all day and I can't function, i brought a razor into the shower and  <e1> almost slit my wrist but stopped myself </e1>  because  <e2> I thought there might be a chance for us to stay together </e2> . I texted her and she said that the only way we could stay together is if we had a baby with her right now.  The only problem is we're graduating highschool in a couple of months.  I have a college set up and everything.  I cant do that.  I know its stupid but I think I might kill myself over this.  I feel hopeless and every 5 minutes I cry.  Help me reddit
I get depressed	it'll start when I'm doing my homework	I've been vomiting from stress since last semester.  Every time I have class critique, which is every class.  Lost ten pounds just from that.  <e1> I get depressed </e1>  because  <e2> it'll start when I'm doing my homework </e2> .  It'll become too physically painful for me to continue and I have to stop.  All day Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and probably now tomorrow, has been spent in my room.  Laying in bed.  Staring at the ceiling. But this weekend felt different.  I don't like what I'm feeling.  I've been suicidal before and this isn't like the other times.  I don't know what's happening.  I don't know who to talk to.  It's like I'm losing control.  I don't want this anymore.  I posted in r/depression yesterday or the day before and only one person answered (thanks to that person, by the way).  Told my roommates when they were coming home and they only asked if I wanted to come out of my room and that was it.  I NEVER ask anybody for help.  Ever.  But all I want right now is for someone to help me.  I don't know what's happening to me. 
I'm happy	the results of today's job	Approaching the 72h of sobriety. Plan was to find something interesting and compelling to do this evening.  A movie, a side projects.   <e1> I'm happy </e1>  about  <e2> the results of today's job </e2> , but the process was quite grueling, I'm tired, bored, deserving and craving for stimulation.  
I	me	I have been doing really good up to now but today I really hated the fact that I had quit smoking right now.  My daughter and I had 2 dachshunds, half brothers, that we both love and today we had to get her lovely guy, Samwise, put down.  He had developed a tumor and was in pain and there was no question that it was the right decision to take the pain away and let him die in peace.  It was all I could do to not go and buy cigarettes.  It was only through really talking to myself and realizing that smoking was not going to make this any easier or less sad, in fact, all it would do was make me feel like shit for smoking.  I really loved my Samwise and will miss him terribly but am glad that going back to smoking is not his legacy to me
Am currently sucking on a cinnamon stick	I just had a trigger but I'm not going to smoke	Wow, it's been 2 weeks.  Not gonna lie, cold turkey's been tough this time (serial quitter, 27 years smoking 1/2 pack a day-ish).   <e1> Am currently sucking on a cinnamon stick </e1>  because  <e2> I just had a trigger but I'm not going to smoke </e2> . What are your triggers? How do you move through them and stay successfully quit?
I	do.	I feel like it's normal to be a little nervous/excited while you're on a first date, but I'm starting to notice that I feel way more anxious about dates than your usual nerves.  It gets to the point where I can't even be myself, and then there's no point to the date.  You're supposed to be getting to know each other, but I can hardly be who I am.  I can't figure out what it is.  I've got a date on Thursday with a friend of a friend who I've made conversation with before, and hit it off really well.  But I'm terrified of going on a date with him.  I don't know what to do.  
It just really bothers me and makes me anxious to do things	I'm worried I'll just forget it and it won't matter	My memory feels like it's really bad.  I do something one day, and a day or two (sometimes even less) I have issues remembering the details of what happened.  This happens with TV shows, games I play, stuff like that.  <e1> It just really bothers me and makes me anxious to do things </e1>  - because  <e2> I'm worried I'll just forget it and it won't matter </e2> . 
I'm	easier?	I'm trying to quit, but recently I've had an urge to search for certain genres of porn - not sure why it's so specific though.  I have opened up certain subreds (+18), that contain certain images and GIFs from scenes.  But I shut down my browser before it gets out of hand.  It's getting harder to make that decision though.  I even tell my self no, but my hands are busy typing in the searchbox at the same time.  On top of that I feel the urges comes in bursts.  I mean they literally come and go from hour to hour.  That's where I'm  starting to struggle with not giving in.  Does any experience that? I would like to hear your experiences advice regarding this. I feel good after deciding not to search for porn, but it doesn't make the decisison easier the next time.   Will it ever become easier?
I am broke as fuck	my downfall at least twice a year	Hey Guys,I just wanted to let it out somewhere.   This is a throw away account but maybe it will help somebody down the line. Back story:I'm 28 years old right now.   Things haven't been too incredibly bad for myself.   I have 2 loving parents and live out in the outskirts of any major city.    <e1> I am broke as fuck </e1> .   This unfortunately leads to  <e2> my downfall at least twice a year </e2> .   It's kind of odd when you think about it; the folks from the city are always are trying to make it out, and the folks from the outskirts are trying to make it in.   Both sides think the grass is greener on the other side.   Not knowing for a second what life in the other shoe feels like. For the last 10 years or so (i just had my 10 year class reunion, so more accurately about the last 14 years or so) without fail, I fall into at least 2 cycles of deep depression per year.   Though I've never been clinically diagnosed, I know when I start a downward spiral.   I stop caring about my financial situation (spend my entire stock pile on gambling, booze, fun nights
I	life.	I feel like it's too late for me to turn my life around.  I keep trying to be better and to do things better but my unending failures only help pull my further down into despair.  I don't want to try anymore.  I'm not dead but I can see no path which can lead me to being happy with myself and my life.  It feels like It's too late to change my life and the only mercy I have left is dying. I wonder if there's a point when it's just too late to try and correct past mistakes and failures.  You've done all you could but where found wanting and now you have nothing to give for anything else in life. 
stress and anxiety	I have created a pretty bad health anxiety issue	I finally saw help and they prescribed me two types of medication.  The first, Mirtazapine, I am supposed to take a half tablet before bed.  The second is Propranolol which I am supposed to take as needed for anxiety.  The problem is, as a result of  <e1> stress and anxiety </e1>   <e2> I have created a pretty bad health anxiety issue </e2> .  This issue extends to medication.  I can't get myself to take these medications.  Just the thought of taking them gives me a panic attack.  I am afraid I will have a bad reaction, or something horrible will happen (yes I have watched way too many episodes of House).  I am also worried I might become reliant on them and have a tough time stopping.  I just can't get over the fact that they might make things worse.  I know I should be okay with taking them.  But my brain just keeps saying no.  Those with health anxiety, how do you cope with this? What gets you to take medication? I tell myself over and over nothing will happen, but I can't.  
I think about how lonely I am	makes me sad	Yup the title tells it all. .  I don't understand the way I feel. .  This usually happens when I'm laying down and getting lost in my thoughts.   <e1> I think about how lonely I am </e1>  which of coarse  <e2> makes me sad </e2> .  The feeling doesn't just feel like sadness it feels like a bad break up.  It honestly hurts my soul.  I don't understand this feeling because I'm sad about someone I haven't even met yet??? I need someone to explain why I feel like this!!  (Idk which subreddit to post this in, if you do can you please let me know!)
I	guys.	I can tolerate a class setting, but when it's two people in a cramped office it gets tough.  My major is full of extremely type-A social champs, and it's been hard to meet those expectations and get my face out there.  I guess it's just difficult to exude confidence to the higher up staff when I don't have that much confidence in myself. I really don't want my hands or voice to be shaking while in the professor's office or anything.  I feel so assured that I know what I'm taking about, and I don't want to come across as though I don't, or to come across as though I can't handle a simple conversation let alone a thesis presentation.  I also have Tourette Syndrome, and the stress of this semester has been causing some of the motor tics that I usually have decent control over to flare up.  My weird blinking tic has been especially prominent lately, and I'm worried that I wont be able to hold it back very well.  He's going to think I'm insane.  I'm extremely anxious about the whole thing.  I really just need some place to vent.  Thanks, you guys.  
I can't fucking achieve anything in my life	I can't concentrate and focus	So I got this horrid disease.  I hate not being able to focus on shit.  I hate having a short attention span.  I hate being shittier than everyone else who doesn't suffer this. . . . . . I mean I would swap this shit for any other mental disorder. . . . . . . .  <e1> I can't fucking achieve anything in my life </e1>  because  <e2> I can't concentrate and focus </e2> .  Can Bill Gates ever be as great as he is if he had ADHD?  Fuck no.  What is the point of living if you got ADHD? I hate thinking about the fact that by the time my life ends I'll by an old miserable man.   Why must this fucking hold me back from doing anything in my life? I won't even experience half the things other normal people experience.  
Title	time.	Title pretty much says it all.  I'm back on a normal dosage, but Now I'm totally depressed without any breaks.  Sleep disrupted to hell.  Can't think or plan positively.  And I'm about to start my new job tomorrow.  To think I was foolish enough to actually be excited about it, how naive.  I'd cry if I had any emotions.  Thought about killing myself, but the usual deterring thoughts weren't there this time. 
[Earlier	feeling	[Earlier this morning I posted this comment]( reddit. com/r/ADHD/comments/2ydzal/stop_reading_reddit_and_get_back_to_the_work_you/cp93xic), which is something I've been struggling with for a few weeks now.   For some reason, posting that comment was enough for me to sort of snap out of it and try to look at ***why*** I was feeling bored and frustrated. I opened a new Word document, closed my eyes, and started typing everything I was feeling, all the overwhelming things that were essentially paralyzing me from doing anything.   A lot of it boiled down to anxiety--in fact, the first thing I typed was the question Why am I anxious?  I initially came up with nine sentences about how I was feeling
I live in the US and have yet to find a full time job	I don't have a lot of money	My boyfriend thinks I have depression and wants me to get help.   <e1> I live in the US and have yet to find a full time job </e1>  (I am still in the process of searching since graduating in December), so  <e2> I don't have a lot of money </e2> , but I think I am on my parents' insurance still, though I don't know that they cover mental health care. I also don't really know where to start? Like do I see a therapist? A psychologist? A psychiatrist? I don't really feel anything super negatively, like I am not *sad* a lot of the time, I just feel nothing.  Nothing is exciting, I don't really care for video games or drawing or reading or anything really.  I mean, yeah, I have a few problems in my life (no job, huge student loan debt, working a job I don't really care about), but I have never been abused or anything or have any real reason to be depressed, but yet I still just kind of lay around in bed or aimlessly browse reddit when I don't have to be at work.  So I feel really guilty about getting help.  Like oh
I might not get an apprenticeship because of my absence because of my depression	more depressed and harder to go to school	Everyday I immagine some sort of scenario which Id like to live.  But they are all unachivable and then I just get more depressed knowing Ill never have that good life. And even when I try to get my life together like I want to I fuck it up. .  For example  <e1> I might not get an apprenticeship because of my absence because of my depression </e1> , making me  <e2> more depressed and harder to go to school </e2> . . .  I wanted to work rotational weeks with 2 weeks on oil rig and 4 off work, or 4 weeks on 8 weeks off.  But they dont take losers with a ton of absence from trade school. . Why does reality suck so much?
I	out?	I dropped out of the UT comp Sci program in 2003.  I have a little experience in a few languages (java, python mostly) I'm looking for someone to help me get back into learning by helping me with a little android app that I think is probably stupid simple but I just get overwhelmed and shut down when I open up Eclipse.  Anyone willing to help me out?
in order to get rid of the anxiety	you have to get used to see people all the time	I feel like the idea of overcoming SA has to do with becoming extroverted and basically to become every other generic person on this planet to be compeltely blunt. . .  that  <e1> in order to get rid of the anxiety </e1>   <e2> you have to get used to see people all the time </e2> . Because that would make me pretty frustrated because I like being alone in relatively long bursts. . .  I just wish I wouldn't be so inept once I seek the outside world. 
I just feel SO glad	free of those ridiculous misconceptions and illusions that kept me a smoker for long	Just checking-in, and noticed I've got 755 days - I just hit my 2 year mark last month on Valentines day. For those in the first few days, weeks, and months:  It absolutely gets easier.    I was a smoker for 20+ years.   Now, after 2 years + smoke free. . . .  I *rarely* have fleeting thoughts about smoking.   The first few months were tough for me, but as time passes - so do the cravings bit by bit. Ultimately, though,  <e1> I just feel SO glad </e1>  to  <e2> free of those ridiculous misconceptions and illusions that kept me a smoker for long </e2> .   All I really had to do, was fucking stop.  Keep it up folks!
I	this?	I interviewed for a tech job today and think my potential new boss has social anxiety of some kind.   She had me call her (not the other way around) and had me do an extensive tech test *before* even a basic phone screen, which is unique in my experience.   In retrospect, I suspect this was done to greatly reduce the number of strangers she would have to talk to before eliminating most of them in the testing round. In our brief phone conversation today she seemed a bit nervous and uncomfortable but seemed reasonably impressed and mentioned wanting to set up an in-person interview shortly. I'd like to do well in this upcoming in-person and a big part of that might be making her comfortable around me as a stranger.   * What can I do to help her out and make her feel good about our meeting?  * What are the do's and don't's of a situation like this?
I	do.	I could have sex with an invisible man in a sense-deprivation chamber and I'd still get distracted by something.  What do I do. 
Well.	anxiety!!!!!!!	Well. . . THAT was stupid.  So when I get anxious one of my symptoms is chest pain.  I happened to remember there is a condition called angina pectoris, and I was pretty sure it was always benign.  So I googled it to reassure myself.  BIG MISTAKETurns out it might be, or it might not be.  It may be a precursor to a HA (GAWD I can't even write it out!).  I have a device implanted that essentially does a continuous EKG and uploads it nightly. . . but it turns out that people with angina can sometimes have normal EKG/ECG readings.  Effin great.  Freaking.  The.  Hell.  Out.  Now.  GAAAAAA, I hate anxiety!!!!!!!
I have a meeting with my prescribing psychiatrist on the 18th	I feel my dosage is wrong	I was wondering if anyone could provide some insight into how I could tell if my dose is too high / too low?  <e1> I have a meeting with my prescribing psychiatrist on the 18th </e1>  because  <e2> I feel my dosage is wrong </e2> , but I'm not certain if it's too much or too little, can anyone share their experience when they were on too low of a dose, or too high? 
ok	do	ok 2 things first off.  1) My disease is porn &amp; sex so not the same as alcohol but the roots are the same.  FWIW I'm 5 years sober from alcohol and drugs woo hoo!!! 2) Understand the steps is putting it mildly, I read a book on sex addiction, Out of the Shadows, it described the steps and what their purpose is.  I'm totally on board, lets get rolling. ok now that the pretense is out of the way.  I'm down with the steps but my disease is saying, hey now that you know what you need to do
This	restlessness.	This is a foreign experience for me, it's good but I'm not used to it.  I used to always get exactly 1-2 hours, wake up shift over another 2-3 hours wake up same time groggy, terrible dry mouth, bladder full of toxic piss, etc.  Now I'm sleeping a full night, waking up whenever my body feels like it.  It feels good but at the same time I can't shake off how I'm not used to this.  Anyone get this sensation when they quit (the sensation of something positive being alien and possibly bad). Also god damn, I always squeeze a little dream in about drinking and letting everyone down including myself every night, wake up and realize oh so I didn't! Falling asleep is still difficult, a lot of anxiety thoughts and general restlessness. 
I	go.	I have tried a bunch of medications and different therapies.  If none of them have helped why doesn't it make sense to kill myself?Why should I keep fighting through each miserable day with no hope when it's so much easier to just let go.  
I made it to 70 days today	I am really happy about	Hey everyoneSo  <e1> I made it to 70 days today </e1> (I've been porn free for all of 2015 so far!) which  <e2> I am really happy about </e2> .  I am feeling much more comfortable with my sexuality and my views towards other's bodies.  I did a presentation in one of my classes that dealt with porn, specifically kinky porn, which I used to watch a lot of.  And it went extremely well.  I didn't feel as awkward as I thought I would have, and I think been porn free helped a lot with that.  I have been speaking pretty openly about porn with people, though not about my personal use of it,  but about how gross and powerful porn is.  I would not have made it this far without this community, and I am extremely grateful to all of you wonderful people.  Much love and keep strong! 
I quit	I was scared if I die and will not see my daughter grew up	I've been drinking since 16 and now I'm 35 and I quit 18 days ago.  I used to drink every day starting with 2 or 3 bottles of beer in earlier years to 6 or 9 bottles of beer later on.   <e1> I quit </e1>  because  <e2> I was scared if I die and will not see my daughter grew up </e2> .  That's all, folks.  Keep on going.  To my surprise I do not have any daily cravings just sometimes I miss that bitter beer taste in my mouth and that relaxing feeling right after couple of sips. 
Life.	host.	Life.  Cold.  Painful.  Just enough joy, to have hope.  And to lose it.  Just enough food, to recognize an empty stomach, and the skin that hangson the sharp edges of your bones.  Escape. Would only propagate the pain.  Like a disease.  Malignant.   The growth that slowly putrifies its host.  
Feeling	anyway	Feeling better and better each day.  I have come to grips with a lot of reality. (feels like plenty for now).  I still get sad but it's less and less.  My attention is slowly shifting toward fixing what can be fixed.  And away from what cannot.  My nerves are much calmer  now that I have accepted my present reality.  I go to my first AA meeting on Monday.  So we will we how that goes.  I live in a tiny town so most if not all of the people attending will be there by court order, not by choice.  I don't care.  I have to get this out of me.  In real life.  I have to pour it out onto the floor and allow myself to feel in front of peers.  I was raised in a house where boys don't cry or show emotion.  It was not an I love you Son.  Kind of house.  Not with my Father anyway.  I have already broken that cycle with my own son.  But some things seem to be harder to rectify than others.  So anyway
I've	them.	I've been feeling emotionless for over a year now and I just want it to stop.   Nothing makes me feel happy, sad or angry.  At the same time I don't feel depressed or suicidal.   My grades aren't slipping in school.   Whenever someone tells a joke that I find funny I genuinely laugh but I don't feel the laughter.   I would appreciate some advise on what to do and if you need any specifics I'll try to give them. 
I	someone.	I hung out with some people I rarely see and for the first time in a while, I wasn't sad or dreading something.  This is probably a stupid post but I just wanted to share with someone. 
I'm	selfish	I'm fucking done.  I'm not even going to try to be melancholy and shit. FAMILY MATTERS my fucking ass.  If suicide is selfish
I can't make myself happy	I can't try	suicide is so messy.  I wish death wasn't so sad, and no one ever felt guilty.  I wish when someone died, it was like The Giver and it was embraced and almost happy.  it's so hard for me to look forward to anything.  It's my fault that I'm sad.   <e1> I can't make myself happy </e1>  because  <e2> I can't try </e2> .  I'm not that kind of person.  I feel that I'm not ever going to be able to do something great.  I won't ever be satisfied with myself.  I just want to raise my white flag and have everything be over with.  I mean it when I say that I can't get better.  there is something wrong with me, but I don't think it's something that could be fixed.  I'm just a shitty person.  does the world really need another one of those? 
I don't deserve	I have no passion or motivation anymore	Hello, late nighters.  Whenever I can't sleep, I spend my time here.  I'll leave posts about my story that relate so that the OP knows they're not alone in this. But I've been hit with harsh realizations one after another, and it's gotten to be too much, too fast.  I've been depressed for about 3 to 4 years now, and have had suicidal thoughts for the past year, all of which without medication.  My parents know about this, but can't do anything about it right now until I hit 18 in a couple of weeks and find a new primary care doctor. I just feel like shit at this point.  I can't fall asleep regularly anymore.  I have only a handful of friends that are pretty much acquaintances now.  I just want to end everything right now.  But I can't. Damn lizard brain won't let me.  So I'm pretty much stuck here, getting accomplishments  <e1> I don't deserve </e1>  because  <e2> I have no passion or motivation anymore </e2> . Life sucks.  I am sorry I haven't been able to talk with all of you who need it most, though. 
So	this.	So I'm a 19 year old guy in university, I usually drink once every week or two with friends.  When I drink, I'm typically fairly tame. .  I never really make that much of an ass out of myself. But afterwards, I just feel so ashamed and depressed.  It lasts for days at a time sometimes. And if I make one little mistake, or when I look back at something and can think of a way I could have handled it better, I'm literally disgusted in myself. Like I said, I'm not the one to get drunk and make a scene, get violent, or anything like that.  Even when I blackout, worst I'll do is be a bit more social than normal, openly sing along to music, and allow my friends to take pictures with me. I don't think alcohol is the problem, but I don't know.  I'm not even entirely sure what I'm posting for, but if anybody can relate to this please let me know how I can try to deal with this. 
I	relate?	I realized recently that I have a huge issue with generalization vs specifics.   Seeing the forest for the trees.   But when it comes to my own or others' feelings. Like if I have a bad day at work I generalize it to mean I hate my job totally.   Or if my SO seems a little distant for one day then the whole relationship is worthless.   Or if I am slightly annoyed with where I live then I need to move across the state or something. I know there is negativity and catastrophization in there as well but it struck me that getting caught up in details and the temporary, the here and now is what I do as a person with ADHD as well.  Can't see the big picture, the reality of the situation. Can anyone relate?
I'm a computer science major	I'm assuming that more is expected of me	My GPA right now is kind of low.   It's being dragged down by my grades back when I didn't realize I had ADHD and I got kicked out of college.   Right now I'm at around 2. 15, and the colleges that I'm trying to transfer to require only a 2. 0 GPA, although I've been told that they usually look for 2. 50 or above and that it also depends on major.    <e1> I'm a computer science major </e1>  so  <e2> I'm assuming that more is expected of me </e2> .   I probably have to have at least a 3. 0 or maybe even a 3. 5 to transfer.   Anyways, who here has done it.   I'm feeling pretty down right now and I'm just thinking about giving up on this whole idea of getting a bachelors degree.   I'm starting to come to the conclusion that I just was not meant to have a good life or be happy.   If I could travel back in time maybe I could change things, but that's not possible.   I'm stuck with the consequences of having untreated ADHD for so long.   I'm 28 and I feel like my life is over. 
Hey	all.	Hey guys and gals,I'm glad I stumbled upon this sub, I just wanted to get a few things off my chest and I hope the format comes out right. I'm back on meds for the first time in 8 years, I can't believe I went without for this long, I feel like I've missed out on my 20s. However, im having issues with anxiety, I feel like everything I say is stupid and out of line and that I talk to loud.  I was wondering, is this an ADHD thing, could I have another issue or am I imagining things?Really anxious now, over something pretty dumb I said earlier.  (Damn that impulse control)Thanks all.  
I feel like whenever I go in for diagnosis, they say seasonal affective disorder	I tend to have my most depressive times during seasons for about 2-3 months intervals	 <e1> I feel like whenever I go in for diagnosis, they say seasonal affective disorder </e1> , because  <e2> I tend to have my most depressive times during seasons for about 2-3 months intervals </e2> .  But I've never heard of anyone being as depressed as I get during these times due to SAD.  I turn into a completely different person and nobody wants to be around me.  When I'm outside of these times, people say I'm extremely likable and outgoing and successful. 
I disable chat	even seeing the other people talking gives me the stomach rumblies	Throwaway because, anxiety.  So I'm not TOO bad in person, I can carry on conversations and manage to be witty and calm most of the time.  However online and in game I become a spaz.  I used to be a massive WoW fan, and Xbox Live participator in my teenage years (now mid 20s).  However somewhere in the time between I have developed this terrible online anxiety.  MMOs are still my favorite, however  <e1> I disable chat </e1>  because  <e2> even seeing the other people talking gives me the stomach rumblies </e2> .  This means I can never make it to max level doing solo missions.  I have also completely given up my obsession with shooters and tabletops.  (RIP DnD. ) I really miss this part of my personality, and I'm sick of single player games.  Anyone have similar issues, or any advice to offer up?
Quit	clean	Quit cold turkey.  32 days clean.  Enjoying additional energy, not being tired in the middle of the day and fucking awesome smells of a spring. *EDIT*Nice to see my own almost 100 day old post! still going strong and clean
So	thought	So just some context: in highschool I was obsessed with this girl.  She tried to be just friends with me but I was always trying to take it further.  The very end of senior year I forced a conversation and we haven't spoken since.  That was all three years ago.  I try not to think about all of that although I'd thought I'd come to terms with it in a certain way, but once in a blue moon I'll have a dream that we fix things and become friends again, and I had one of those earlier this week.  So naturally I start obsessing over scenarios and whatnot, this was also fueled by accidentally seeing her on TV (college sports) and an old friend asking about her when we were catching up.  And also by the fact that I've been a severe dissociated state since spring break started for unrelated reasons. One of these scenarios that played out in my head ended up with her saying she had forgiven me but then (again, in this made up scenario) I reply But how can I forgive myself? But then in real life I thought
I	else?	I was entirely sober for a month and a half under 10 years.   I decided to drink, and have built it up again to the point that I'm getting scared again, 7 years later.   I have managed to never drive under the influence, to mostly not drink before 5 PM, and to take off 1 or 2 days a week. I'm just afraid I'm still a fucking drunk.   OK, I'm pretty sure.   I fucking hated AA.   What else?
I thought I had gripped my life better then	I canceled the appointment	My doctor gave me 10mg of Adderall last month.  It was superb, I could get back on track, and changed both my professional and personal life.  But I could feel the effects has downward spiral, a week before my medication ended, I felt I had low tolerance towards the drug.  I supposed to go to the doctor two days before my medication ended.   <e1> I thought I had gripped my life better then </e1>  <e2> I canceled the appointment </e2> , I wanted to try my days without Adderall, and see what happened. But I was wrong, its been 7 days without Adderall now, I could not think straight, I sleep average of 12 hours per day, and thoughts driven my brain.  I had make another arrangement with the doctor, but its on the next 12 days, I hope I could survive.  What do you guys think about this?Note: sorry for the broken English.  
I'm	something	I'm an 18 year old guy in my senior year of high school.  My life really isn't too terrible.  I get good grades, I got into the honors program at UConn, and I have a few good friends that I hang out with somewhat often.  But for some reason, I am miserable most of the time.  I used to enjoy video games, but now I just do it to pass the time.  I hate them and hate myself for playing them instead of going out and doing high school things.  Every time someone asks me to do something
Is	rooms.	Is there a reddit approved chat client? I would like it if there was a way that suicidal redditors could share stories and support amongst one another without posting individual posts or leaving reddit to chat on country specific chat rooms. 
When I get to the edge (so to speak) I pull myself back	what it might do to them	I am devastated by this.  I am not sure what this will mean for me or the kids, but I do know I have only been hanging on because of them.   <e1> When I get to the edge (so to speak) I pull myself back </e1>  because of  <e2> what it might do to them </e2> .  Without them, I honestly don't know if I will be able to or even want to pull myself back. Things have been bad with my depression for a while, and I recognize that it is very hard for her to watch me struggle, but I feel like she doesn't see me trying.  I am hurting, I guess. 
After	them.	After feeling better for a few weeks I have been very suicidal again for the last days.  I won't get into details but I'm feeling crushed and I feel like I just want out.  However, I took a shower mid-writing this and (you know what showerthoughts are like) I changed my mind.  I won't post for help, I will post to let you guys know I'm still fighting, and you should fight too.  In this absurdity of existance there are things I long for, a life that I want, and no matter how much regret, hate and hopelessness I carry on my shoulders, I'll keep fighting for them. 
I've	Thoughts?	I've been going to my general practitioner for about a year for anti-depressants.   I'm currently on 60mg Prozac and 50mg Seroquel .  It had been working decently, but now I'm really depressed again and my anxiety is spiking and I'm starting to have suicidal ideation again (no plan, intent or means).   Would it be worth going to a psychiatrist to get meds work out? I currently see a licensed social worker for CBT.  Experiences? Thoughts? 
Flunked	day	Flunked out of college, socially challenged and scared of relationships of any kind, lazy, depressed and feeling pretty down.  Suicidal? It sure would be easier than this at the moment.  Sorry for the /rant and have a nice day
It's	go	It's been almost 6 months since my gf broke up with me. . . I don't have a lot of friend (and I never did), I'm an extremely shy person.  I fell like shit since she broke up with me. . . I realized that I'm alone, no one cares about me.  I feel like the world would be better without me, let's face it, I brought pain to the only person I cared about and loved! I'm still dreaming of her.  I know a lot of people make it easy just let her go
For	yes	For the past few months i've been terribly ' stuck '.  I've been in a non-stopping rotation of negative feelings.  I feel like shit at one point , feel angry the next , briefly ' happy ' and then shit again. My relationship with my dad has never been good.  never had a conversation last for more than two minutes before a fight broke out.  he always preferred my siblings over me.  im the youngest , unsuccessful unmotivated one.  hes always hypocritical , always lying in order to prove his point against me.  to a point where i break.     have u tried talking to ur dad ?!?!??!!!  .  yes 
(For	which	(For full disclosure: Currently unmedicated due to being kicked off of insurance, trying to work it out with the clinic if the manager will just *return my phone calls already*)Despite making moves to change this, I've been unemployed for months.  I know, I'm not alone in that. But I do think today's job search in my field conflicts with ADHD tendencies that, to be honest, I've grown to accept: curiosity and pursuit of many subjects and having a flexible outlook on the world. **But today's job market is all about:*** **A) keeping to one critical path, so you have followed ONE subject faithfully to where you are on your way to being a subject matter expert, and*** **B) establishing a personal brand that orbits ONE particular theme or motif. **   I'm trying to break into tech which
I've	language	I've been taking ritalin for a few months now, and I definitely feel happier on it, especially ~30min after taking it (when it starts kicking in). As well as the euphoric feeling, I also get *much* more talkative and interested in conversations! When I don't take ritalin, conversing feels more like a chore. I'm just wondering if these are all ormal effects of ritalin?Edit: English isn't my first language
I feel like I either get too overwhelmed about keeping up with it either	I come up with some kind of unhelpful color coding scheme that I think is a good idea at the start and is just too complicated or I just don't have the energy or wherewithal to write in it and look at it on a daily basis	What daily/weekly planners have worked for you all? I always seem to get excited about getting a new planner for the calendar year or school year yet I never seem to keep up with it after a couple of weeks (funny that I've always had this issue and didn't know it was partially related to ADHD since I was just recently diagnosed).   <e1> I feel like I either get too overwhelmed about keeping up with it either </e1>  because  <e2> I come up with some kind of unhelpful color coding scheme that I think is a good idea at the start and is just too complicated or I just don't have the energy or wherewithal to write in it and look at it on a daily basis </e2> . 
So	someone!	So I had one of my worse moments tonight, and I felt really like I was getting in my head.  I decided to force myself to draw and my god did it help.  I can't draw well but it helped distract me and get some emotion out in a safe way.  I used to do music but I'm cutting down since that makes me feel more disconnected in a weird way.  So try drawing, I hope this helps someone!
First	meds)?	First things first: I am not diagnosed ADHD, having an appointment with a specialist in June, currently on antidepressants and life hasn't improved much. I seriously can't get anything started or get myself organised enough to begin something unless I have a rather unhealthy dose of caffeine (usually that would be Coke/Pepsi) and it's scary how productive (in comparison at least) I will be then. What is it like for you, do you rely on caffeine, do you even notice effects as strongly as I do? Did things change as soon as you were on meds? Should I rather cut down on that habit now until I get my appointment and get (hopefully) proper medication?tl;dr Do you rely on caffeine for self-medication (if not on meds) or have you changed your caffeine-related habits (after meds)?
I quit	I had bronchitis really bad and I couldnt breath	Never thought i could consider myself a non smoker but. . . .  I am :))  <e1> I quit </e1>  because  <e2> I had bronchitis really bad and I couldnt breath </e2> . .  I thought wow if this is how it will feel down the road from smoking I dont want that .  People always say they have trouble breathing .  You dont pay attention until you physically cant .  I did it .  19 DAYS AGO I REGAINED MY LIFE AND UNDID THE CHAIN I HAD FOR 7 YEARS. . . .  so can u !
All,**TLWR;	help.	All,**TLWR; My question is do some of you NOT experience the emotional dysregulation side of ADHD as much as the other symptoms?  Are you even-keel?**I personally don't experience much emotion.   Most things slides off my back, and are forgotten within minutes(Thank you crap working memory!).   I rarely get anger, if I do it is quick, loud/eruptive, and then forgotten.     99% of the days are even keel, rarely sad, but also rarely elated or extremely happy.   I live almost solely in the now(1 minute window. . . seriously), and the now is often neither happy or sad it just is fine.   I feel like I move on so quickly that I don't have time explore the anger,sadness, or happiness. I think it has served me well in that it didn't exacerbate my other issues.    Emotional issues seem to be some of the most destructive for ADHDers.   I been able to maintain jobs, a handful of friends, and wife, despite the other significant impairments. So is this a normal experience for some of you?  Or is some other aspect of my personality that is counterbalancing things.   I can't seem to find this addressed in anything I read. Thanks for the help. 
So	here.	So I've never connected with any of the post on here.  If anything its made me question my diagnosis/treatment.  Maybe I just don't have it as bad. .  but then I don't know what's wrong with me. . . I graduated last year and Ive been attending community college.  A month after graduating I got hired as a co-op in information technology.  Supposed to be a 2 year job.  I don't know how long ago, but what feels like a month or two ago they let me go for budget cuts.  For a couple weeks beforehand I was losing steam in school and work.  Now it's just like. . .  I don't know.  I started seeing a therapist and psychologist for help, but I've lost all control.  I sit down to study and within 5 minutes I'm on videogames or watching a show.  I go somewhere else to work and all I can think about is going back.  The only break I get is 2 hours a week I'm forced to sit in the college cafeteria because I carpool. I just hate everything now, thought I'd rant here. 
Springtime	deal	Springtime of 2011, my friend died.   It was my first death to go through and I remember the weather and constant rain of spring while getting through it. Springtime of 2012, I was fifteen.   I guess I was going through some crisis.   I got overwhelmed by nostalgia.   I acquired this new fear of growing up; not as big a deal
I	yeah.	I need someone to nag me basically.  I've kind of given up on being able to nag myself.  I can't pay with money - don't have any - but I could nag you to do something you need to do until you do it.  Or I could draw pictures for you, that's technically what I'm going to school for.  Or design a website or make you a playlist of happy music or anything, really, I'm desperate and I can't, just cannot, ask my friends or my family to do this for me.  You know? I just cannot do it. Anyway, yeah. 
it feels like you are back to square one	think maybe i am meant to smoke	I am struggling for the last couple of days.  I have no  idea what causes this.  I still think about smoking all the time.  I am pretty sure i wont cave in at this point but  i constantly find myself thinking how nice it'd be to end this battle and enjoy life again.  Its just that i am tired of this fight.  It is stupid i know.  I red Allen Carr in 2 different languages twice.  I know it gets better in time.  But then some days  <e1> it feels like you are back to square one </e1> .  This makes me  <e2> think maybe i am meant to smoke </e2> .  I go out partying and dont even think about smoking.  At work vast majority of my friends chain smoke which doesnt bother me at all.  But it just wont heal.  I dont want to be a smoker again.  I also want to be happy  
I am ugly	hard to have any self confidence pride or dignity	All I want, all I care about, all I think about, literally, all day long, every day, is that I want a girlfriend/relationship/companionship.  But  <e1> I am ugly </e1> /unattractive, and it really makes it  <e2> hard to have any self confidence pride or dignity </e2> . Doesn't matter what personals service I use, what I write, it all comes down to my photos, and I'm just not as attractive as other men.  So for over the past three+ years I have gotten 0 replies and 0 interest.  I took a break from trying to meet people, but it's starting to grind on me again.  I am really lonely. Everyone always says I have to get out there.  Well
I didn't want him to hurt himself	I told a counselor	I have a friend who is suicidal, and I told the school counselors.  I had a friend who was suicidal a few years back and she attempted suicide, and I felt like it was all my fault.  And then earlier this year, a girl in my grade who I knew committed suicide.  <e1> I didn't want him to hurt himself </e1>  so  <e2> I told a counselor </e2>  - I honestly didn't know what else to do.  But I guess they've contacted him and now he's posting on his blog about how  whoever did it ruined his fucking life and he hates everyone  and I know he doesn't know it was me but I still feel so fucking guilty and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry
when I do it all seems like arbitrary info to me	I never spend the time to plan out my budgets	I can't seem to keep track of my day let alone what I spend money on.   I have mint but I rarely check it and  <e1> when I do it all seems like arbitrary info to me </e1>  because  <e2> I never spend the time to plan out my budgets </e2> .   I just need to figure out a way to be more financially aware that caters a little bit to my needs.   I know a lot of it really does have to do with just buckling down every now and then and getting it done but its hard to get started.  
I'm	me.	I'm insecure and depressed, I want to talk with a doctor but I'm afraid if I book an appointment my mom would freak out.  I always put on the act that I am happy when really all that keeps me going is my love for music but even that started slipping away I'm 14 and if I told my mom I'm depressed she'd probably have a heart attack or just wouldn't believe me. 
I	:'(	I get so depressed at night.  like i dont have any energy, but i have just enough that i cant sleep.  i lay in bed and look at the ceiling all night.  Nobody even gives two shits about me.  i feel so alone, especially since i dont get much sleep.  whats wrong with me? :'(
I'm in the process of getting a prescription (stim) authorized	I'm not sure if I will even need it if I'm having this kind of reaction to my diet change	HiYesterday I had like nothing to eat.  However I noticed I was a lot more calmer and balanced than I usually am, especially without meds.  I observed this during my therapy appointment and came to the hypothesis that maybe I feel this way because of my low carb consumption up to that point. 24 hours later I still feel freaking amazing.  Focused but not anxious, and energetic yet not hyper.   <e1> I'm in the process of getting a prescription (stim) authorized </e1>  so  <e2> I'm not sure if I will even need it if I'm having this kind of reaction to my diet change </e2> . So I just want to pop in and say that low carb diet for sure is helping me and it might help you to.  Even words are flowing for me at a much more fluent rate as I'm typing this. . . . . . it's incredible. . . . 
she was depressed	her mother is an alcoholic and has tried to kill herself in front of Suzie	My friend (let's call her Suzie) recently told me why  <e1> she was depressed </e1> .  Long story short,  <e2> her mother is an alcoholic and has tried to kill herself in front of Suzie </e2> .  Her brother is hooked on opiates and is in terrible shape.  Suzie has contemplated suicide. As a friend, I want to know that I can be there for her.  I was just wondering if you guys have any idea as how to comfort someone that is depressed like this. 
I	job.	I guess my face got so used to a neutral indifferent expression.  On the bright side, I got a job. 
friends, family, and David's reduced sodium sunflower seeds	I remain strong	I have lurked /r/stopsmoking for a year or so, jealous of your collective commitment to a better life.  This week has been a roller coaster of emotions for me, but thanks to  <e1> friends, family, and David's reduced sodium sunflower seeds </e1>   <e2> I remain strong </e2> .  Thanks again guys and gals.  
Hello	advanced.	Hello all, I've been taking adderral daily for about a year and a half.  For the most part I think I know what to expect.  My last prescription fillup, the pharmacist asked me if 2 different manufacturers was okay, I didnt give it much thought and said yeah with the assumption that they are exactly the same.  Since around the time of this last feel up, Ive felt odd, more constipation than usual, regular headaches, and lethargic.  It may be dehydration, though I always have water with me, but the weather has been hitting the low 90's so maybe Im still not drinking enough.  What I'm wondering is, Can two different generic adderrall have different side effects? This question may have been posted previously, sorry if this is the case. . .  I dont want to get lost in reddit while searching. .  Thank you in advanced. 
.	decision.	. .  Like myself.  Abused the meds a few times in my history of taking them.  Haven't done so in months but it's still something I have to think about, lest I relapse. Saw [this]( imgur. com/yK1LKrZ. jpg) in /r/pics . .  A pill-bottle cap that keeps track of the last time it was opened.  For the forgetful, and for those that may be tempted to open it *too many times a day*.  Will it stop you from making a bad decision? No.  But it's another factor of thought involved when trying to make a bad choice, another acknowledgement that you're about to make a bad decision.  
For	go	For the past couple weeks I haven't been myself.  I've lost interest in hanging out with my friends.  I've have this lingering feeling of being upset that comes and goes.  I have a very little appetite when I am not the person to eat little.  I can't take criticism lightly and normally recently.  I am constantly thinking of how bad a person I am.  My girlfriends depressed but she's pretty much moved on from it she has her occasional episodes but we have been.  I have no idea how to approach my parents about this.  I feel like they won't believe me or brush it off and say it's just a phase something.  I can barley sleep and I am feeling tired all the time Please help EDIT: was really looking for my help here guess this isn't the place to go
I	of.	I think this makes it even harder for people with depression to see the bigger picture and not just the little hopeless bubble we can't seem to find ourselves crawling out of. 
TL;DR:	meantime!	TL;DR: Do you get anxiety from taking your ADHD meds? Is this a normal thing? I took Concerta (36mg) for about 3 months, and it began making me very anxious.  I switched to Vyvanse and have now been taking that for about 2 months, and I'm finding it's making me anxious as well, especially if I'm sitting still or not physically doing something.   Is this normal? I also take an SSRI, Citalopram.  Maybe that could have something to do with it? I have a doctor's appointment in a few weeks, but was hoping for some input in the meantime!
I have been extremely anxious	the past year and a half or so about my health	 <e1> I have been extremely anxious </e1>  for  <e2> the past year and a half or so about my health </e2> .   I've been called a Hypochondriac, which doesnt help.   I've had pain under my jaw for the past year and a half.   I made one appointment, and a Dr.  told me come back in 6 months.  I never did, and recently made an appointment with another doctor.  She wants me to get a CT done, and I'm terrified that I'm going to lose my jaw or something due to cancer, and I waited too long to get treatment.   I just turned 26 today, and instead of studying or enjoying my birthday, I am worried about my neck and the constant soreness I have.   From what I can tell, nothing has changed, theres still a difference in size between the left and the right (the right side being slightly larger or swollen than the left) but it hasnt gotten larger, better, or worse in the past year. I'm terrified and anxious and its really getting in the way of me enjoying life and living to my potential in school.  
I want to make that turn off the highway	it said EXIT 72	I want to wake up in the morning and feel curiosity run through my veins, I want to smell the breeze of freedom, but most of all, I want to go over there - just beyond the hill.  I want to know what it's like to contemplate life's greatest mysteries on the top of a jungle waterfall.   <e1> I want to make that turn off the highway </e1>  just because  <e2> it said EXIT 72 </e2> .  I want to track down the world's greatest cafe to have coffee on a Tuesday with birds chirping and a party cloudy sky.  I want to feel the crunch of dried berries
that fact	freaking me out	she told me that people can become dependent on it and  <e1> that fact </e1>  is  <e2> freaking me out </e2>  so it makes me not want to take it which makes me anxious and it's dumb.  I'm also on zoloft but I've only started taking that about two days ago so I'm still waiting for it to do its job. 
I	happen.	I really do.  I'm a pathetic, lazy, stubborn piece of shit.  When I look at myself I see absolutely no redeeming qualities.  I see nothing of value.  I'm 23, I sit in my room all day browsing the web.  I have no job, no money, very few friends, and absolutely no social life.  I have zero prospects of any kind, and I'm the one to blame.  I am the one who's done this to myself.  I'm too much of a coward to get help for my problem and I refuse to tell anybody about what I'm going through.  I don't fucking understand why I do this.  Why am I like this? I cry often, almost every day, and yet I sit here typing this and not seeking help.  I'm a colossal fuck up, and I know for a fact my parents are not proud of me.  They just think I'm a lazy moocher.  I just want to scream, at the top of my lungs, until they hurt.  I want all of this pain to leave me.  I just want to be the man I should've been.  I don't think thats ever going to happen. 
I've	about?	I've always read that you shouldn't take acidic foods like OJ or chocolate with amphetamines (I take dex-amp IR).   But how exactly does this work?  Could someone explain it or post a link to a website that does?Here's [the wikipedia page]( wikipedia. org/wiki/Human_gastrointestinal_tract) for the GI tract and it includes a drawing of how the stomach, small and large intestines all connect to each other. As best I know amphetamine gets absorbed in the small intestine, not the stomach, is that true?  So is it the ph of the stomach or small intestine or urine or what that we're concerned about?   
Hey	advance	Hey all,This may be quite a common post, but recently I've been getting these periods of time were I'm just pissed off.  It's been fine up until now, but last night I was having a text convo with someone and got really pissed off and said something that I regretted, and It's completely unlike me to be an angry person, or spiteful in anyway. For the most part my life is fine.  Minor stresses here and there from College and other typical things that life throws at you, but nothing that should cause this. Any help or similar experiences?Thanks in advance
I just missed the drop date for dropping a class	I'm going to get a 0	So I've been tested for ADHD before, but just kind of STOPPED following up with the doctor just because.  I've been reading on this subreddit for a while trying to see if I should go back.  My life is hall marked by things like losing my keys and wallet (I've actually had to have new car keys made twice now),  <e1> I just missed the drop date for dropping a class </e1>  so now  <e2> I'm going to get a 0 </e2> , and it's not that I was busy, but I just. . .  Didn't do what I should have done.  I don't keep shit clean, I rarely brush my teeth, and I'll sit down and just browse the Internet or play PS3 for hours.  I procrastinate for everything, and I'm just wondering if this seems like a problem for this subreddit, or getdisciplined.  Thanks everyone. 
It	my apatite leaving me feeling weak from hunger	I feel like I have to force feed myself after taking Adderall sometimes.   <e1> It </e1>  destroys  <e2> my apatite leaving me feeling weak from hunger </e2> .  I'm sitting here choking down a nature valley bar and its delicious but eating can be a struggle.  My question is why does Adderall mess with your appetite and how do you guys deal with it? 
one of her churchmate set me up	look like i did something obnoxious behind her back	Im depressed as well right now. I am currently in love (true love, not crush etc) with this woman who i believed was my meant to be.  We fit each other's gear so well so to speak.  But  <e1> one of her churchmate set me up </e1>  to make it  <e2> look like i did something obnoxious behind her back </e2> . I didnt.  She believed her churchmate instead.  its been months.  Ive sent her flowers every other werk, sends her nessages but no reply.  She blocked me from her phone.  Her facebook page looks like i never existed in her life. I was framed and i lost the girl who was the reason i was happy with life. To have the girl you love think ill of you to the point that she is blocking you off hurts so much everyday. I feel numb and the only other emotion i can feel is sadness.  It has been months, i know ill forever be stuck this way. 
I've	it.	I've succesfully pushed everyone away yet I feel lonely but online shopping makes me feel like there is something to wait for.  Checking status of package.  Once it arrives at my work place whole day I fight urge to unpack whatever it is that I ordered.  I would play with my new oy for a while eventually get bored and look for something new.  Currently I'm waiting for 1 man tent.  I hate sleeping in tents.  Before that I've bough vinyl of band I like.  I don't have gramophone.  Now I have excuse to look for gramophone once I receive new pay check. This might seem funny but I can't really afford it.  Quarter bonuses kind of save my budget but I'm worried one day I'll go overbaord. Even this post seems to me like an investment that I can look into in some time to see how it developed and what happened with it to take my mind off my life.  At least I don't have to pay for it. 
When	connection?	When you just don't feel like you have enough energy to do something. . . especially if it involves thinking. Yes, we know that more sleep, better diet, and more exercise will help but some people apparently can get by without all of those in perfect harmony somehow. . . (I'm in a healthy range and I'm college age so no problems here)I'm ADHD-C + anxious and I wonder if the anxiety has a connection?
About	happy	About two months ago I started to notice a change in my mood.  Mainly stabilization, but a change nonetheless.  Suddenly, in place of numbness and apathy, I am aware of feelings returning.  I could laugh.  I could hold a conversation and not want to run away instantly.  I wanted to hang out with friends.  I wanted to DO things.  Oh my goodness the desire to do things was so novel to me.  It still is. I cautiously told my cohorts that I felt cheerful and even possibly. . . happy.  But I didn't commit to being happy
This	appreciated.	This has been bothering me for a few days now and so it's about time for a vent session.  When I'm hypomanic, I have a problem with controlling how much I spend.  I'm a student and I don't make that much money at all.  Getting a paycheck once a  month has helped with budgeting but at the same time, sucks.  Blowing through money is not the greatest. . . especially when you don't have much.  I'm trying to fly down for my friend's wedding and that's going to be expensive.  It's a struggle to save up enough money.  Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. 
I've	myself.	I've been suicidal on and off for 5+ years.  My life is beyond fine. My only problem is that I am unwilling to seek professional help.  I've thought about it but I don't want to go through that mess again. I've come to terms with the fact that I am going to kill myself eventually.  I'm just not sure when. I don't hate myself.  I don't have a terrible life situation.  I just want to kill myself. 
Have	success?	Have any of you had a difficult time holding down jobs? What were some of the reasons you were let go? For those of you who have had success holding down jobs. . . what were some strategies that lead to your success?
So,	HA	So, I'm sick and it sucks.  I found some Theraflu packets of cold medicine that are yummy and lemon-y when dissolved in hot water and work great.  As I was boiling the water this morning I saw this warning in huge caps on the front of the packet. And I was like HA HA HA
I	HELP	I am 19 never had a girlfriend and never even dated a girl.  I feel that if I see an attractive girl I am unusually attracted and sometimes can't stop myself from looking.  I think these are some of the effects of ADD, but my question is will I ever be happy with a relationship.  I have read online of so many difficult marriages because of ADD.  HELP
It's	normally!	It's eye opening to look at other posts and see how some people really do suffer with SA to extreme levels! My SA goes as far as blushing and feeling nervous in front of girls etc.  and having general nerves when talking to groups of people.  But compared to some other people, what I have is nothing and is probably something they wish they could swap with.  I really hope everyone here finds away to get over SA and be able to live their life normally! 
I'm	years.	I'm pretty much stopping cold turkey.  My dependency has gotten out of control.  I was drinking ab two pots of coffee for 5 years and between 15-30mg adderall daily for ab 2 years.

I recently had an adverse reaction to a new SSRI	me being Baker Acted into a psych facility	 <e1> I recently had an adverse reaction to a new SSRI </e1>  that resulted in  <e2> me being Baker Acted into a psych facility </e2> .   I was relatively calm albeit scared to whole time.   In hindsight, I kind of wish I had prepared for something like this happening.   I was transferred from my local hospital and I was extremely dissatisfied with the lack of compassion and care, I didn't feel safe.   I was wondering if anyone else had a plan like this laid out in case of emergencies so they knew what facilities were good and complied a list in their area to assure that you'd receive the kind of care you want. . . 
I walked in feeling iffy	I have been on and off medication for awhile I was worried that they'd be like so	Went to go talk to provider about getting back on medication today after putting it off for awhile.   <e1> I walked in feeling iffy </e1> , since  <e2> I have been on and off medication for awhile I was worried that they'd be like so </e2> 
So	story?	So I haven't really seen a topic where people brag about their success with medication.  It's sad to see next posts where X person has Y problem.  So what is your successful medication story?
I definitely drink too often	I've been hemming/hawing about quitting	Hi everyone.   First let me thank you all for being here and supporting each other, including me.  I am on day 2 of sobriety.   I'm really sick of drinking.   In a lot of ways, I cannot relate to the epic volume of booze that many in AA recount.   I usually drink 4-5 beers, 4-5 days per week and I also smoke about a joint of weed every day (it's legal where I am).   I know for certain that I will feel better, lose weight, lift the mental fog.   I'm ready.  I went to my first AA meeting about 6 weeks ago and went to 5-6 random meetings before making a commitment and getting a sponsor.   I'm doing the 90 meetings in 90 days on recommendation of many.   Although I don't drink as much,  <e1> I definitely drink too often </e1>  and  <e2> I've been hemming/hawing about quitting </e2>  since January 2014 with a lot of difficulty.   I couldn't get a week sober yet.  I read Allen Carr's book last weekend. 
I find it easier to simply abstain form going to the liquor store to buy 'new' alcohol	if I simply don't go it won't be there to drink	I think alcohol has it's place in society.  In fact, I have enjoyed the nuances and craftsmanship of fine liquors, wines, beer, over the years.  I have two special bottles  - a Cognac and a high end Kentucky Bourbon still in my shelf.  I don't have the heart to pour them down the drain.  Knowing they are there is hard.   <e1> I find it easier to simply abstain form going to the liquor store to buy 'new' alcohol </e1>  - because  <e2> if I simply don't go it won't be there to drink </e2> .  But these two bottles at home. . . both gifts, both 'good stuff'. . . I just don't know what to do about them.  But they are there and I very aware of them. . .     My badge says two days  - although I really began on the 6th and had one drink on the 7th &amp; 8th (never gone sober this long in 15 years).  
I need to stop gaming	Gaming is a slow poison that's destroying my marriage and motherhood and career	 <e1> I need to stop gaming </e1>  or I am slowly killing my self.    <e2> Gaming is a slow poison that's destroying my marriage and motherhood and career </e2> .   I've been down the quitting road before but sadly got sucked back in.  Allowed myself to play just a little which has turned into playing while drinking till 4 AM.  I can do this.  
I've been suicidal since I was about eight	I used to cut myself when I got home from school	You can call me tad.  I'm fifteen, a freshman.   <e1> I've been suicidal since I was about eight </e1> .  I had no freinds and was doing terrible in school.   <e2> I used to cut myself when I got home from school </e2> .  I didn't know that cutting was a thing people did until a few years later.  I never told anybody.  I think I mentioned wishing I was dead a few times to my mom, she would just say things like oh stop that and no you don't.  I still have scars on my hands. Anyways
I stopped taking the SSRIs	I noticed the suicidal thoughts were increasing in intensity	For the last 6 or so years, I have had suicidal thoughts with somewhat regular frequency.  About a year ago they started increasing in frequency, severity, and detail regarding methods.  At the time I was on a series of different SSRIs to try to manage my depression.   <e1> I stopped taking the SSRIs </e1>  when  <e2> I noticed the suicidal thoughts were increasing in intensity </e2> .  Now I am nearing the same level of ideation but I am no longer on medication.  The thing is that I know that they are empty, that I will not follow through with any of them.  It almost makes me discredit them as problems- they seem insignificant compared to the impulses that would cause someone to end their life.  But surely even harmless suicidal ideation is not something to be taken lightly. . . I consciously avoid situations that might lower my inhibitions toward these impulses.  For example
I just haven't had the will to get up and get something to eat	I just don't care anymore.  I am constantly thinking about suicide, and each day, the feelings keep on increasing in intensity	 <e1> I just haven't had the will to get up and get something to eat </e1> .   <e2> I just don't care anymore.  I am constantly thinking about suicide, and each day, the feelings keep on increasing in intensity </e2> .  I just want to sleep forever or better yet, not exist.  DAE ever get so apathetic they can't even eat anymore?
I	worse	I am 15 so I'm actually (hopefully) a long way from death but it's not the actual event that terrifies me.  It's the idea of non-existence.  I have no diagnosed problems and have never seen a psychiatrist or anything but I'm worried if I don't kick this fear then it could develop into something worse
social anxiety depression	i feel worthless.  i have no energy left to go on but not enough balls to kill myself	 <e1> social anxiety depression </e1> , the usual i guess.   <e2> i feel worthless.  i have no energy left to go on but not enough balls to kill myself </e2> .  ive tried i really have .  tried to keep going on, to find strength. . hope.  i cant see a reason though.  nothing is getting better.  broke down and called my girlfriend, she was no help, didnt think shed be.  told me she was out with her friends and there was nothing she could do.  my mother told me it was all my fault.  i dont know.  i really dont know. 
I'm	went.	I'm visiting my home town, which is where I spent my entire childhood, for a few days with my parents.  Later on today I'm going to talk a walk by myself just to see my old favorite spots again, and then I'm going to drop by my old high school to say hi to my old teacher and any of my friends who still go there.  I'll be going at lunch time so I don't interrupt anything and my mom's sure it's allowed as long as I check in, but I'm really nervous.  I'm going to have to talk to a stranger to get in and I haven't talked to my teacher in a couple of years.  Part of me wants to forget about swinging by my school, but part of me really wants to go. **Update:** My dad went with me to my old school and helped me sign in as a visitor, but other than that I did it all by myself.  The teacher I was hoping to see wasn't there, and neither was one of my friends who still goes there, but my best friend was there so I'm glad I went. 
A family member's recent diagnosis	me to start reading up on ADHD, and once I did, I realized I really fit the profile of the high-IQ inattentive-type female who goes undiagnosed into adulthood	 <e1> A family member's recent diagnosis </e1>  got  <e2> me to start reading up on ADHD, and once I did, I realized I really fit the profile of the high-IQ inattentive-type female who goes undiagnosed into adulthood </e2>  because she can keep up appearances of having her shit together, to a point. I'm seeing a school counselor with dubious credentials in a few days.  Hopefully I'll be referred to a competent specialist.  Then I'll have to figure out how to transport myself out of my bumblefuck town to that specialist without a car, presumably several times.  Then maybe I'll have an *actual* long-term solution for my problems, instead of those drastic life-reorganization methods I try to implement every week or so. In the meantime, I may or may not be one of those self-diagnosed fuckheads that people complain about clogging up r/aspergers et al.  I don't really have much of a point, just venting nervous energy.  Feel free to ignore and/or delete.  Of course, if you relate to this, feel free to say so. **TL;DR** Whether or not it's due to ADHD, I fucking SUCK at [the waiting game]
it's just so tempting to just empty the contents of this bottle, and the many others in my home, into my stomach and just fall asleep	I just feel so used, damaged, and unlovable.  It's exhausting to wake up each day and pretend like I'm okay	And  <e1> it's just so tempting to just empty the contents of this bottle, and the many others in my home, into my stomach and just fall asleep </e1> .   To just have all of this pain and despair end. . .  just drift away.    <e2> I just feel so used, damaged, and unlovable.  It's exhausting to wake up each day and pretend like I'm okay </e2> .

I was diagnosed.  As most of you probably have as well, mainly anxiety can be terrible	My doctor told me as a way to calm myself, to start writing out notes at work instead of typing them	It's been two years since  <e1> I was diagnosed.  As most of you probably have as well, mainly anxiety can be terrible </e1> .   <e2> My doctor told me as a way to calm myself, to start writing out notes at work instead of typing them </e2> .  I work in IT, so I'm always making to-do lists and so on.  My handwriting is also terrible.  All my teachers growing up would complain.  So by taking my time with it, It serves to calm myself, my handwriting is much better than it used to be (I guess practice makes perfect?), and with a physical list on my desk, it's easier for me to keep track of what needs to get done.   Overall, this practice has become one of the most important things I do everyday.  And plus, I actually look forward to doing it now.  This could be part of taking adderall though. . . ?Has anyone else received this advice before? Also, I wonder if the bad handwriting trait is part of ADHD.  Who else has terrible, unreadable writing?Thoughts?Thanks guys!
Hi	group.	Hi all. I'm curious to hear from some of you about your experiences where other people in your lives (spouse, friend, coworker, etc. ) have been a part of your alcoholism?  Did it cause you to continue drinking/relapse? How did you handle it? Are you still associated with these people? I have some people in my life that were, at one point, very close friends.   However, as I commit to not drinking, I've noticed that maybe the alcohol was the only thing keeping us close with each other.   I've also begun to notice that I may be better off without these people in my life.   Unfortunately, I'm not exactly sure how to handle such a situation. Thanks - you're all great and I really appreciate this group. 
Last time my badge got up to 24 days	I was very proud of myself and felt a lot better	This is my 2nd(3rd?) time to try and stop drinking.   <e1> Last time my badge got up to 24 days </e1>  and  <e2> I was very proud of myself and felt a lot better </e2> .  It was hard, but not as hard as I expected I to be.  The whole March month went by with nothing exciting happening, no big parties or anything.  Two weeks ago I went to a big party that (I know, not a good idea) I had decided I would be drinking at.  The following 3-4 days continued with heavy drinking.  I then tell myself: Dude
Hi	Thanks	Hi guys,B1.  On Lamitical 150.  I'm a northerner planning on traveling to warmer sands a few times this summer.  Trips to Ibiza, Napa Valley, and San Diego are in the works. I'm wondering what, if any, steps you take to prevent these kind of fun vacations into manic binges marked by bad decisions.  To give you an idea of what I'm talking about, I'm 24 and have been know to drink harder than Don Draper on St.  Patrick's Day.  I'd like to steer clear of that kind of behavior and am wondering if there are any helpful tips you'd be able to offer.  Thanks
Took my medication on very little sleep today	making a total fool of myself in front of a professor during office hours.  Lots of stuttering, awkward pauses, voice was shaky as hell etc	Does this happen to any of you? Normally when my meds are working, this doesn't happen as much.   <e1> Took my medication on very little sleep today </e1>  and ended up  <e2> making a total fool of myself in front of a professor during office hours.  Lots of stuttering, awkward pauses, voice was shaky as hell etc </e2> .  Pretty sure there were a few moments where I started talking and then just lost my train of thought entirely.  Must have looked schizophrenic.

To give an example, ;Tried to practice online for a german language course and now i am reading esperanto and haskell;this week i decided to do some socket programming in perl and as of now i am reading about multithreading in C.

How do you people manage self learning with ADHD? Please share your tips.  
i really fucking love art	this made me so happy	So we spend a lot of time discussing meds, techniques to deal with our ADHD and problems we face but i thought it would be good to hear of the thing in your life that you are proudest of -we can all use a little reminding sometimes that our existence isn't totally suppressed/dictated by ADHD, and that we're all very capable of doing things we can be extremely proud of just as much as anyone else.  It can be anything that you were just really chuffed about.  Kind of like a win wednesday but instead from all days ever. so share the good feels, and take it away!mine is getting full marks in my art A level-  <e1> i really fucking love art </e1>  so  <e2> this made me so happy </e2> . 
Probably going to self harm	Maybe then I can be free of this suffering	 <e1> Probably going to self harm </e1> .  I've been a week clean.  It doesn't even matter though.  Hopefully I will accidentally cut too deep.   <e2> Maybe then I can be free of this suffering </e2> .  Whatever.  I don't care anymore.  Im a depressed fuck who know one can handle and no one cares.  What's the use? Im nothing.  Anyways
So	apart.	So I was on Adderall XR 25 MG with Lexapro 10 MG last summer during my internship and I wanted to try the next year of law school on Vyvanse 50 MG instead.  I was irritable all year, barely focused, and was not a happy person in the slightest.  Even if I felt better on the inside, all of my personal relationships were tanking.  I just switched back to Adderall 25 XR MG with my Lexapro and it's like waking up from a bad dream.  Just a heads up for those of you who are on Vyvanse and see things falling apart.  
I	psychiatrist?	I went to a psychiatrist for the first time and was diagnosed with clinical depression.  She prescribed Wellbutrin for me in the mornings and Seroquel for bed-time.  I am fine with Wellbutrin because it seems like a popular antidepressant.  However, what about Seroquel? I am not bipolar or schizophrenic.  Just depressed.  Is this doctor over medicating me? These drugs have been prescribed for a period of 4 weeks until our next appointment.  I am very hesitant to start Seroquel.   Does anyone have any experience with these drugs? Should I just trust the psychiatrist?
for all 22 years of my existance, I can't find someone who cares about how I feel	I'm alone	I don't understand why,  <e1> for all 22 years of my existance, I can't find someone who cares about how I feel </e1>  (besides who I mention later).  I've literally had therapists stop contacting me, so it's not like it's just people I consider friends and family. Sure, I usually put up a strong front but shouldn't that mean that when I do show just how vulnerable I am someone at least asks me why I'm sad? Or tries to console me? I do it for them.  I get into these relationships with people who show me that they can be at least compassionate.  But they end up complacent.  I'm really beginning to believe that most people are horribly selfish and that I should just accept it.  I know my mom will hold me or my cats will come.  But I was always under the assumption that people who love each other do that kind of thing.  I don't break down often unless I'm having a particularly bad month.  I've come to terms with the fact that I'm not asking too much and certainly not more than I give.  I just want a compromise.  But  <e2> I'm alone </e2> . 
my mom has been struggling with clinical depression	I remember her being very despondent and far away, and how hard it was to communicate with her	For a long time  <e1> my mom has been struggling with clinical depression </e1> .   <e2> I remember her being very despondent and far away, and how hard it was to communicate with her </e2> .  She wasn't very hopeful about her condition improving - but a few weeks ago things started moving into place.  Recently a light has sparked on in her eyes.  She's smiling everyday.  She's animated and lively and witty and I honestly have never seen her happier.  I just wanted to share this to show that things can always, always get better.  No matter how daunting, sucky, impossible or scary it may seem there's always hope.  That doesn't make depression any easier to deal with.  I know that.  But I know my mom struggled recalling freaking hard and now she's happier than she's ever been.  So don't think there's nothing when everything, everywhere, is out there and possible.  
some car accidents, impulsive behaviors, and inability to finish any tasks	I talked to a psychologist and he was pretty confident I have had ADHD all my life	Hi all,I am a 25yo female, in graduate school, diagnosed after sort of unraveling.  I had been keeping it together all my life due to relatively high IQ, desire to please parents/teachers, but after  <e1> some car accidents, impulsive behaviors, and inability to finish any tasks </e1> ,  <e2> I talked to a psychologist and he was pretty confident I have had ADHD all my life </e2> .  Like many, I wish I had known this earlier. . . it could have saved me a lot of grief and anxiety. ANYWAYS. . I have a *BENIGN* cardiac arrhythmia.  My first psychiatrist put me on 20mg of Ritalin (10mg 2x a day to start me out).  I had no negative side effects except some sweating, occasionally I felt a little increased anxiety/hyperactivity.  Then she checked my heart and noticed my arrhythmia (I had forgotten to tell her because it's such a minor thing. . . it has been fully checked out and it's fine). She freaked a bit, ordered an EKG. . . which read A-fib because of the abnormal heartbeat.  Long story short
#	crying	# Edit: Thanks for the responses, everyone!I'm currently taking Ritalin 10mg, 3 in the morning and 3 around lunch (in between classes).  I definitely notice a positive effect compared to when I'm off meds - I didn't take them for a week during the semester break and that really messed up my progress in assignments etc. Anyhow, I've read a lot of testimonials (for lack of a better word) where people who have started meds have noticed an incredible change.  Stuff like I finally feel normal! or I'm so happy that I'm crying
Still	all.	Still alive.   But not really living.   When Sawyer Sweeten committed suicide a few days ago I was ANGRY - WTF could a 19 year old possibly know about life to have the nerve to make that kind of final decision?  How selfish can a person be to do that to their family and friends?    Then I remembered: I was 17 when I attempted suicide.  I was certain I'd had enough of life and that it wasn't going to get any better.   That was 30 years ago, and I still struggle.   Maybe 19 isn't so young after all.  
drank myself to sleep 90% of the time over the last year	I wake up miserable, feel like crap for most of the day	I have probably  <e1> drank myself to sleep 90% of the time over the last year </e1> .    <e2> I wake up miserable, feel like crap for most of the day </e2> , tell myself that I am not going to drink. . .  and 7pm rolls around and the Vodka comes out.  I have to go to wikipedia to look up the endings to shows that I have fallen asleep during.   I forget things.  My gut is growing, I feel like I look 5 years older and I just am unhappy.  Today I stop.  I am miserable and need to not be. 
my girlfriend has been going through a lot with regards to her EDOS	She will often binge and purge	So recently  <e1> my girlfriend has been going through a lot with regards to her EDOS </e1>  and ive spent time googling what I can do to help her.  But I thought I would ask here for a more personal approach.   <e2> She will often binge and purge </e2> , shes been very open to me about this.  But I feel like I could be doing more to help her.  We also go to the gym, she will run for a while but my PT said that people use exercise as a form of escapism.  Pretty much im just looking for ways I can support her and try to avoid putting her into situations she feels like she needs to purge or binge. 
So	things	So this text is a bit personal and might not be interesting.  However, if you are depressed and lonely, you might find some interest or inspiration in it.  I plan to get out of this limbo, and this is how I'm going to try to do it. *My plan for my depression*So, it appears that I'm again quite depressed.  It's not the first time, and I have this gut feeling that it will not be the last.  However, from my failures of the past, and from thinking about them, I think there may be ways to fight against it.  So here are some of the ways that I've thought about. The main thing is being active: doing precise things
I feel numb	my depression	Guys, I'm at a loss.  I don't know what to do.   <e1> I feel numb </e1> .  this feeling is getting worse.  I wont go into specifics about my issues, cause honestly, does it even matter? probably not.   <e2> my depression </e2>  is depression no matter the circumstances right? it doesn't matter the trigger its there.  the reason i'm even typing this up is to drive me away from staring at the wall.  i've been thinking lately, doing a lot of introspection and I know the difference between different types of suicidal thoughts.  There's a distinct difference between, I want to die and I just can't live like this before
I cant understand my homework i am falling behind in my classes	I want to end it why go on if i am doomed to a mediocore life	 <e1> I cant understand my homework i am falling behind in my classes </e1> .   <e2> I want to end it why go on if i am doomed to a mediocore life </e2> .  
I am afraid of the pain a cruder instrument would cause me	I am not actually considering suicide seriously enough	Unlike many on this page, I have never attempted suicide before.  I have never self-harmed nor seriously harmed anyone else.  If I end my life, I want it to be virtually painless.  I feel, however, that since  <e1> I am afraid of the pain a cruder instrument would cause me </e1> ,  <e2> I am not actually considering suicide seriously enough </e2> .  I think I want to live, but then again I'm not sure.  My mood constantly varies and I'm just not sure what to do.  All I know is that I can't go on living in my current state of emotional and mental stress any longer. 
People know but they're no help at all	I don't even no why I bothered to tell anyone in the first place	I never needed to rely on anyone, I've been depressed for years and kept it to myself.   <e1> People know but they're no help at all </e1>  so  <e2> I don't even no why I bothered to tell anyone in the first place </e2> . I don't have to put up with the tedium of people constantly asking me what's wrong or trying to improve my mood, as long as I stay out of people's lives and keep to myself everything will be smooth sailing.  Man.  Suicide is gonna be awesome when it comes.  
I'm trying to look for some places to apply for a summer job, especially in the field of sports	this is a career possibility for me	 <e1> I'm trying to look for some places to apply for a summer job, especially in the field of sports </e1>  because  <e2> this is a career possibility for me </e2> .  I found a few places to apply as a soccer coach but although I have the experience of playing at different levels, I've never coached and wouldn't know the first thing of being in charge of a team and fear having to talk with students, direct, and even talkign with parents.  My parents area really pressuring to pursue these opportunities but I'm afraid that I'll have a breakdown.  What to do? How did you go about finding a job? 
Would	26.	Would you like to try medication? would you like to try some behavioural therapy? We have xyz resources to help.  You can call, talk, etc.  What would you like to do?I say I am currently just happy to be diagnosed.  I never had a plan on what I should do if I am diagnosed so no clue!Edit: I am 26. 
I	brighter?	I woke up feeling a bit lonely and depressed today.  What do you guys / gals do to turn the day around? What are some of your favorite things that you do to make the day a bit brighter?
I'm not really looking into getting perpetually bumped higher and higher on this stuff	I was curious about the tolerance and how long of a break one needs for it to come down some	Been taking 40 mg Vyvanse for about 1 year.  I haven't took vyvanse in 1 month because it wasn't as effective as it used to be.   <e1> I'm not really looking into getting perpetually bumped higher and higher on this stuff </e1>  so  <e2> I was curious about the tolerance and how long of a break one needs for it to come down some </e2> ? Thanks. (Please don't lecture me. )
I	gum.	I smoked my last cigarette last friday at around 8pm after getting off work.  I never thought it would be this easy, or feel this good.  The first 2-3 days were a bit tough, but the last 4 including today have gotten better each day.  I'm slowly getting to the point where cigarette smoke smells awful to me, and my cravings are diminishing.  I was already into weight training and the gym while I was smoking, and continuing to go to the gym through my withdrawals helped me have an outlet to cope.  I focused all my negative symptoms into lifting weights and it worked for me. Thank you guys for all the support thus far in my previous posts.  You all kept me strong when I had doubts.  I might update again at 2 or 3 weeks, but I'll probably be saving my next big update for the 30 day mark.  Until next time, this is Omerta214 signing off :DEDIT: For anyone who reads this, I quit cold turkey.  No patches, vapes, or gum. 
if I overdose on anything I will have to restart my sobriety all over again	everyone will count it as a relapse	I was doing so good but lately things have started to go down hill fast and no one seems to be able to help me. I gave up drinking and doing drugs a few months ago and now I have 3 months clean and sober and I have made it 100 days without self harming.  But I feel those urges welling up in me again.  I recently had some Tylenol 3 tablets that my friends forced me to turn into the pharmacy for disposal.  I wish I could have kept them and eaten them all. I want to die but  <e1> if I overdose on anything I will have to restart my sobriety all over again </e1>  as  <e2> everyone will count it as a relapse </e2> .  I wish I had the guts to cut myself. 
I	great.	I finally come to realize that I have a lot of anxiety and constantly worry about what others think of me even when I am not around them! It is not healthy. Is there anything you guys do that helps you calm down and lower the anxious thoughts?Any words of advice would be great. 
Anyone	me.	Anyone else really find it helpful to have marathons of shows running in the background while getting work done? I have gone through all the seasons of Adventure Time, the two for Gravity Falls, and now I'm on South Park.  Something about these cartoons just feel comfortable as background noise at low levels, unlike shows like Game of Thrones that completely destroy my attention. If you're the same way, what other shows have you found helping you more than hindering? EDIT: GOLDEN GIRLS.  something about old women throwing shade at each other soothes me. 
I vape no nicotine	I don't get buzzed and feel high	This is a weird question, but do you? I vape regularly, no nicotine, and I love it.  Every Time I inhale and feel the vape going down my throat and into my lungs, things feel. . .  normal.  Like I said,  <e1> I vape no nicotine </e1> , so  <e2> I don't get buzzed and feel high </e2> .  
For the rest of the night I'm surrounded by non-smoking friends and family	I'm not worried about relapsing, I don't feel like relapsing, but the support and fun that we'll have will help take my mind off this feeling	And so I went for a walk.  The walk felt good and took my mind off the obsession.   <e1> For the rest of the night I'm surrounded by non-smoking friends and family </e1> .   <e2> I'm not worried about relapsing, I don't feel like relapsing, but the support and fun that we'll have will help take my mind off this feeling </e2> . 
I took multiple tests online and they all said I had a form of ADD, whether it was mild or average	I went to the pediatrician's office to see if I could take a test or anything like that	Hi, i'm a longtime lurker but I really need some advice so I decided to make an account.  I'm pretty sure i've had ADD since I was in elementary school.  I've always had trouble focusing, and always get distracted easily, but at the same time I could just have an attention or focusing problem.   <e1> I took multiple tests online and they all said I had a form of ADD, whether it was mild or average </e1> .  So  <e2> I went to the pediatrician's office to see if I could take a test or anything like that </e2> , and one of the first things the doctor asked me was what my GPA was.  I told her I had a 3. 3, which I think is not too good( I go to a prestigious private school where the average GPA is a 3. 8).  Right after I told her that, she literally just said you don't have ADD.  She then explained how it was impossible for me to have ADD with a 3. 3 GPA.  Is she right? GPA is cumulative from freshman to junior year.  tl;dr I think I have ADD
I	direction.	I was put on 225mg of Venlafaxine.  This went on for about 4 months.  After this time I was brought down to 75mg of venlafaxine. . . .  before half a week later to be advised to go cold turkey. Right now i'm experiencing the vertigo nausea you get when looking down from a height. . . .  only this happens when I look absolutely any direction. 
Hi	emergency	Hi guys! So I started taking 25 mg of Lamictal to start my treatment and for the three days I have not been able to sleep more than 4 hours at a time even with sleeping medication.  I am wide awake and can not get myself to calm down enough to sleep.  I feel like I am wired.  My psychiatrist said that it might be an emergency if I can not sleep by tomorrow.  Has anyone had this problem? She did not elaborate on the emergency

Now I am back on </e1>  because  <e2> I noticed I was getting overwhelmed too easily at work and making small stupid mistakes </e2> .  Also have had a problem with finishing articles and getting bored with mundane tasks.  Now that I am back on I do not want to over medicate and jump up in MG. . .  I had decent control of my add but needed a bump to just make things a tad easier.  Any tips to medicate properly? I don't want to end up building too much of a tolerance to it and lose what I have now. . .  Thanks! 
i feel terrible	my gf is sleeping in the dip in the mattress and refuses to let me turn it around because she says she doesnt mind but is having trouble getting to sleep	its currently 4. 30am, i just smoked my first cigarette in 8 months and ive not slept at all this eveningive been laid in bed with my girlfriend slowly descending into a minor meltdown untill i had to get out of bed and smoke SOMTHING just to stop everything, i just could not stop thinking and thinking and thinking and i went into overdrive worrying about everything and went into full meltdown mode internallyim worried about money, i have enough to get by just about, but our mattress is fucked and i cant afford to get a new one,  <e1> i feel terrible </e1>  because  <e2> my gf is sleeping in the dip in the mattress and refuses to let me turn it around because she says she doesnt mind but is having trouble getting to sleep </e2>  its all just gotten on top of me and i dont really know what to do

I am very phobic about doctors and get panics attacks when going to doctor appointments	The panic starts in the waiting room and I start to feel like I want to run away or run out and can barely sit still when I get to the doctor's room	HiWondering if anybody can advise?  <e1> I am very phobic about doctors and get panics attacks when going to doctor appointments </e1>  which aren't something I can just walk out of.  I'm just wondering if anybody can advise how to manage this as I have a visit coming up next week and I'm already scared to go. A lot of advice about panic says things like muscle relaxation or go for a walk or lie on the floor or meditate but in the middle of an appointment I can't do those things and I need to be with it and to perform by answering questions or having my blood pressure taken or whatever.   <e2> The panic starts in the waiting room and I start to feel like I want to run away or run out and can barely sit still when I get to the doctor's room </e2> . I don't want to discuss this issue with the doctor - who will be a new doctor to me - which makes the situation more anxiety-provoking as I don't know how badly they will treat me. Thanks for any advice! I'm pretty desperate!
HEre	him	HEre is the situation, I will be brief.  My boyfriend and I have been discussing over the past couple of days things we can change, or improve upon.  We both recognize that neither of us is going to get 100% of what he want.  He wants unlimited understanding, I want immediate results.  Upon discussing he was saying all the things he wanted to change, and I thought the goals while noble were somewhat unrealistic at this time.  All at once.  I said I think we should keep the goals realistic and this offended him greatly.  He is really sensitive when it comes to people not believing in him
Has	anymore.	Has anyone else made this switch? Any advice on how to do it? What has been your guys' experience with prozac? I'm really nervous about the switch. I was on lexapro 10mg for almost a year and my doctor prescribed me 20mg prozac since my lexapro doesn't seem to be working anymore. 
I actually hate writing with pens	my handwriting was separated at birth from it's twin, indiscriminate scribbling	Anyone else here feel better when they're writing with brightly colored pens?  <e1> I actually hate writing with pens </e1>  because  <e2> my handwriting was separated at birth from it's twin, indiscriminate scribbling </e2> , but I tend to use them at work.  I find myself using red pens exclusively.  For whatever reason, it makes me more likely to write things down and more likely to read them afterwards.  Any of this sound familiar to anyone?
I'm	way?	I'm taking 36 mg concerta, and I feel alert once the effects set in but then gradually become sleepy.  Is it due to tolerance or is it because people with ADHD are supposed to react this way?
I'm	:D	I'm looking for your success stories, mostly self employed or if you have a demanding job.  And most specifically, your task management apps, your annual monthly weekly goals converted into your task manager, Evernote, Google reminders etc. .  How you prioritize your day and stay on task.  How you work in medicine and your gym routine.  What have you found to eat works best.  Basically describe your whole day, from morning routine, work routine, fun and night routine.  A lot to ask, Probably? But this thread is seriously lacking success stories, and I think this could really help show some strong knowledge on what works for us adhd'ers.  Especially the self employed ones! :DHappy Friday! :D
I'm	them	I'm starting to have serious suicidal thoughts, should I tell my parents? Don't want to scare them
After every session of Dex, my brain immediately goes into a head fog that prevents me from doing anything else unless I either go to sleep or take another pill	I sometimes end up taking it twice a day, and then a Vyvanse	Hey all,I've been taking 5 mg dex for about 3ish weeks now.  It kicks in after about 30 mins or so compared to a 2hr kick in time for Vyvanse, so I either take it during the day (if I need it quick) and then Vyvanse later, or I take it later in the night.   <e1> After every session of Dex, my brain immediately goes into a head fog that prevents me from doing anything else unless I either go to sleep or take another pill </e1> , so  <e2> I sometimes end up taking it twice a day, and then a Vyvanse </e2> . I've had a busy time at school and so I've been regularly working on stuff from 9am to 5am (with breaks for class, food, activities, etc).  I've noticed that I'm a bit more miserable on dex once I've come down from it.  I also have finally slowed down this weekend (the first time in weeks I was able to catch up on sleep) and now I'm in a terrible head fog and slight depression
He	too!	He started on Ritalin, and then the Doc switched him to Concerta, which just made him defiant and grumpy.  We switched back to Ritalin, and he is doing really well during the day, but in the evenings he can become a bit melancholy and sad.  He's a happy and loving kid, but a bit prone to anxiety and probably shows early signs of depression.  I know its still very early, he's only been medicated for less than two months, and I'm sure there will be a lot of trial and error.  I'm just interested to hear from other people who were diagnosed young, or parents of kids who have similar/different experiences.  Thanks to everyone on this sub.  You all helped me go out and get diagnosed, and subsequently, get my son the help he needs too!
I	guys?	I know that writing things out tends to help me remember things, but it seems like bits of paper could be ready to lose track of.  On the other hand, an electronic system seems easy to get distracted by and forget to use in the first place.  Easier to forget, out of sight and out of mind, intangible. . . . . What works for you guys?
i used to see a psychiatrist or therapist ( what ever you call them i always get them confused ) but now shes says that if i'm going to do it , hurry up and do it and stop wasting my time and money  every time i ask for the therapist number to make an appointment	now i have a glock hiding in my AC vent trying to figure if i should do it before i'm a counselor for the summer or after it finishes	I'm (18M) always on edge now.

I fill my time with ambitious looking pipe dreams to avoid the reality of real work.  I let myself fall behind	get frustrated	I am lazy, and apathetic.  I am too weak to seek out whatever will make me strong and capable.   <e1> I fill my time with ambitious looking pipe dreams to avoid the reality of real work.  I let myself fall behind </e1> , and  <e2> get frustrated </e2>  for doing so.  I care more about my escapism than my family.  I care more about smoking pot than going to school or finding a job.  I have become my own biggest hurdle.  I've never tried medication, and I want too solely to force a chemical change in hopes that maybe I can force myself to change into a better person.  I have never developed a good habit, only bad ones.  I do not know true work ethic.  I am a failure.  
My	forever.	My mornings feel so long.  The 1-2 hours I am alone.  Going to sleep at night as well.  From the moment I wake up.  I feel like crap.  I don't sleep well.  Dreams/nightmares keep me awake.  I toss and turn waking up every 2-3 hours.  I don't feel better until about 7 am.  My job keeps me busy, but I am not happy there either.  When I get home.  I'm alone.  Most of my friends are still at work or school because of my schedule.  I go to sleep early to try and make up for lost sleep.  I'm gaining weight.  Weight I worked so hard to take off.  I've gained 15 lbs in about a month.  I stopped going to the gym.  I don't feel as motivated.  Even singing or playing drums.  I don't feel like doing those things.  The nights are worse.  Going to sleep alone.  Knowing I only have to repeat this whole thing tomorrow.  It's been about a month or so.  But it feels like it's been a year.  like forever.  
4:30	up.	4:30 AM. . . wake up jittery. . . eat half a piece of turkey bacon, one dried prune, cross fingers.  6 AM: Feel better but hungry.  Breakfast = sprouted grain/etc.  type cereal, unsweetened soy milk.  Two Applegate chicken &amp; apple sausages.  One dried prune (need groceries, out of fruit).  Went back to sleep at 7:30-ish.  Woke back up at 8 or 8:30 with enough shaking that I could have shook myself out of bed.  Gassy and belching, probably from the soymilk.  Been drinking too much of it to compensate for so much rice.  10AM: chugged a glass of rice milk in desperation.  A little better. 11:15: made tuna salad, supplemented with slice of gluten-free bread and handful of sweet potato chips.  Praying.  Shaking.  Crossing fingers.  Need to bleeping get groceries tonight--need to get it together to leave the house.  I WAS going to yoga this morning, that got shot down quickly.  This morning's spell was worse than last night's rice reaction.  Ugh.  Praying I don't puke any of this up.  
<e1>	read!	 <e1> I broke up with my long time girlfriend a year and a half ago </e1>  after  <e2> she cheated on me </e2> .  Weed has been there as a crutch every time I felt down but it never seemed to help the problem.  They say the best way to get over a girl you really deeply loved is to find another.  That's where my problems started to grow.  Every time I muster the energy to get off the couch and go out, I'm usually dead quiet, sitting with my other stoned friends watching the fun everyone else is having.  My one friend who can act normal and social when high always tries to help me find girls.  When he brings some around I freeze with anxiety and the few words I do say are awkward and I immediately turtle into myself regretting everything I managed to say.  I started last week but succumbed on  a Friday.  Will quitting help me out in respects to my dating life?Thanks for the read!
I have a job interview on Friday, my ADHD got in the way	I forgot what time it is at	 <e1> I have a job interview on Friday, my ADHD got in the way </e1>  and  <e2> I forgot what time it is at </e2> .  How do I call them and explain this to them without them think I'm irresponcible**Edit:** Thanks everyone I'm happy to say it's Friday at 2 pm
My	yourself?	My therapist and I had a very detailed discussion our last session about emptiness and identity.  I've been feeling pretty empty lately and certainly confused about where my life is headed.  We mutually agreed that identity and emptiness are interrelated. Just curious, how do you deal with emptiness that doesn't just involve temporarily distracting yourself? 
I have pretty general social anxiety	I cannot go in a public restroom at all, unless I have complete silence, nobody is in it, and there's no threat of anybody entering it	 <e1> I have pretty general social anxiety </e1> , but one thing that always hangs over my head is my shy bladder.    <e2> I cannot go in a public restroom at all, unless I have complete silence, nobody is in it, and there's no threat of anybody entering it </e2> .   It's been this way for years and I absolutely hate it.   I realize that it's completely irrational, and as far as I know there's no real reason I have it, but it's been a major and constant threat to my social life.   Is there any possible way to overcome this on my own? or should I try going on some sort of anxiety medication?
solid food feels really gross in her mouth and she can't get it down	It makes me sad to see her struggle like that and I want to help	Hello Reddit, I love my girlfriend a lot and want to try to help her get over her eating disorder.  She's at a healthy weight and doesn't seem to have huge body image issues.  She does think she's kinda fat though :( Anyways, we're going through a tough time financially and haven't been able to keep buying weed(which is legal here, WA state) and now she can't eat anymore.  Apparently  <e1> solid food feels really gross in her mouth and she can't get it down </e1> .   <e2> It makes me sad to see her struggle like that and I want to help </e2> . Does anyone know anything helpful? I just don't really know what to do.  I could try to get more weed, but that's not a real solution to the problem.  Thank you!
Everyone	experience.	Everyone here is fantastic and I've finally managed to work up the nerve and put off the procrastination to try and better myself.  Can't tell you how anxious I am right now. . . Update: Looks like I have found a good psychiatrist.  Immediately recognized everything that I've been telling him and is going to be very helpful.  Already feel a tremendous weight has been lifted and I haven't even gotten my prescription filled yet.  I'm not just crazy or lazy after all. . .  I can't wait until I'm able to start my medication, this is going to be an experience. 
I	way??	I got a prescription recently, and I've read that people without ADHD get high from it and feel great.  I don't feel high per se, but I can definitely feel it.  I don't think I've been taking it long enough to tell if it helps my problems yet, but I'm just worried my diagnosis was wrong.  Am I supposed to feel it this way?? 
To	came	To be honest this is a long long story so only those who care enough will read this. I apologize in advance for grammar or paragraph mistakes. I'll give you an overview right now,Im 12 years old,have plotted running away from since I was 8 but never really followed through with it. In elementary(K-5 for me)I was actually happy with my life,I had friends who cared,I had a nice school,A bad family though I bared with it. But then I moved and had to start anew in a new school(6-current),2 cities away from my old one. For the first few days I didn't talk to anyone and had no friends. But eventually I met a friend called Billy(Fake names for obvious reasons). For awhile he was nice but then after he almost broke my arms by screwing around I was fed up and made some excuse to stop being his friend. Over the course of the next months I had only a few amount of friends but I was pretty oblivious to the fact I was lonely but other then that I was happy. Then she came
So	stopped?	So I've been on a fairly low dose (2x10mg per day) of slow release ritalin, for six months or so.  I've been seeing this girl for about 8, but it only got serious (more than booty calls) after I started the meds.  On paper she's great.  Funny, smart, good taste.  I'm somehow not connecting with her though.  I don't know if it's the sexual chemistry, or if it's meds.  I feel in general a bit blunted emotionally, which could be just meds, but could also be mild depression from work stress. Has anyone else experienced a situation like this? To what extent does ritalin flatten out your emotional range? How did it take to recover once you stopped?
I	hopeful	I started zoloft just over a week ago at 25mg a day for 4 days then 50mg after that and it has really made me more anxious than anything.  I have heard this is a common side effect when starting the medicine, but I am concerned that I may be wasting my time on this if it doesn't end up working. . . then I'll have been more anxious than usual for a few weeks for nothing.  Is it worth waiting for the anxiety to die down a little? I've been on Lexapro and Paxil before and they didn't really do that much but then again my symptoms were less severe back then.  I have heard good things from people on zoloft and my psychiatrist and therapist both think it is the right drug so I am hopeful 
I had an interest in Heroin for awhile	I wanted to be Cool	This is something I've been thinking about lately. . . Pretty much everyone I know and I encounter who socializes with other people irl always do so while drinking alcohol.  I haven't encountered a person in YEARS who socializes without alcohol or drugs.  I want nothing to do with either of those things.  I live with a stepfather who is a borderline violent drunk which makes me not want to hang around drunk people (Yes, I know not ALL drunk people are like this, but still. . . ) and the last time I tried drinking alcohol the shit nearly killed me.  I've since sworn off alcohol forever.  And I just have no interest in drugs.   <e1> I had an interest in Heroin for awhile </e1>  (Cause  <e2> I wanted to be Cool </e2> ) Then I learned with my heart condition that Heroin would kill me in no time.  And I just have no interest in other drugs
*I	(yes	*I used ormal because I have no idea what to call them otherwise and did not want to exclude other learning disorders.  I'm sorry if this offended someone. *I've got exams coming up in 5 days after getting diagnosed(ADHD-Pi) a week ago.  I missed all my classes but managed to find some notes.  I am taking meds(54mg of Concerta) and it has made me a lot more active but I can hardly sleep and every morning I wake up even more tired but force myself to take my meds and trudge on. I cannot get myself to study enough (yes
I chose to go to my university	it's big, and I feel trapped and nervous if I only have the option of a few people to spend my time with	I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for which I take medicine.  I decided to study abroad in Brussels for the summer despite this.  It's only been three days, and I hate it, and don't see it getting better.  Even though I go to an enormous university in the US, there's only 14 other people and my program, most of whom I find unpleasant.   <e1> I chose to go to my university </e1>  because  <e2> it's big, and I feel trapped and nervous if I only have the option of a few people to spend my time with </e2> .  I can't eat, I have no appetite.  Apart from rampant sadness, I have become apathetic and have little interest in doing things.  I don't want to explore the city.  Trying to be friends with people I don't really like is tiresome.  All I want is to be with people I know and love back home. 
Eventually this progressed to just not falling asleep	Now I take all sorts of natural Aids to help me sleep	I've had trouble sleep for the last year and a half.  At first I could fall asleep, but then I would wake up at 1am and be awake until 4am.  <e1> Eventually this progressed to just not falling asleep </e1> . So. . .   <e2> Now I take all sorts of natural Aids to help me sleep </e2>  including GABA and melatonin, and all natural capsules of other goodies, and I also have Ativan and zopiclone. Lately, my zopiclone has not worked at all.  My 0. 5 tab dose doesn't even register.  Last night, I finally fell asleep after 3 whole 7. 5mg tabs.  I am female and 145lbs. . .  I don't feel like any of this is normal. I'm relaxed at bedtime after starting a magnesium supplement plan. . . .  So I'm drowsy, relaxed but just can't cross over into sleep.  I can't stop thinking about how I can't sleep and then. . .  I don't sleep.  What can I do to break the psychological fixation.  If I could mentally turn that off, I would.  Maybe listen to a podcast to get my mind onto other things.  Help!
I	today!	I have had anxiety for years and neither therapy nor drugs have helped.  I had recently just been resigned to the fact that I will just be miserable forever, but then I did some reading about supplements.  I started taking magnesium, 5-htp, and fish oil and it's amazing how awesome I feel.  Sometimes I just sit on the couch and marvel at how relaxed I feel.  It's almost euphoric.  My boyfriend, who has also had anxiety problems for a long time, started taking them as well and has noticed the same exact thing.  We both feel great.  That being said, you should check with your doctor, blah blah blah.  Read labels, etc.  It won't work for everyone, but it certainly does for us.  So, I just wanted to share that because I know how desperate I was to find something.  I hope everyone is feeling okay today!
The kindling withdrawals got so bad	I noticed that even if I have one drink, the positive feeling can even wear off in just 10 or 20 minutes leaving me feeling more anxious than before	The way I got off cigarettes is I just realized it is gross and does not even give you any euphoria.  Drinking always seemed like at least it offered me a high and made me relaxed.  After going through hell with it so many times I found that now I actually feel gross even when I have one drink.   <e1> The kindling withdrawals got so bad </e1>  that  <e2> I noticed that even if I have one drink, the positive feeling can even wear off in just 10 or 20 minutes leaving me feeling more anxious than before </e2> .  Despite that I will drink myself sick if given the opportunity leading the a world of hell.  I think I really changed the way my body processes alcohol and I no longer feel reserved about completely eliminating it from my life. 
I	umber.	I think we can all say that most people with OCD will count certain things.  So I was wondering do you guys have a perticular number for everything or does it differ from what you're doing? Mine differs depending on what I'm doing, but mostly it's 21.  But I was just curious if you guys have a umber. 
I've	be	I've been taking 20mg of Latuda for 4 days now.  I've read some of the side effects about it being difficult to cool down after a workout, and to stay out of extreme heat.  Also not to over workout when taking Latuda.  What would be considered over working out? I do the T25 (same guy who does the Insanity) workouts and it's a high intensity cardio/strength workout.  I guess my question or questions would be
I think the doc is hesitant to give me more serious medicine	the possibility of abuse and my demographic	Been on it for a week or two now.  It helps in waves, I have good days and bad days on it.  I find that it sort of helps me focus on a specific task, but getting the motivation to start the task has actually gotten much more difficult.  It hasn't held with my anxiety at all, but that is less of a concern for me. I don't think this is a common side effect but it's effecting my life a lot.   <e1> I think the doc is hesitant to give me more serious medicine </e1>  because of  <e2> the possibility of abuse and my demographic </e2> .  Not that it's a bad thing, honestly that probably best for him as a professional if he can fix his patients without more harmful stimulant.  Obviously im going to talk to my doc, but I was curious if anyone else has this and if it got better over time taking the medicine or if it went away.  I know some medicine takes a while for your body to adjust to so I didn't want to jump the gun and stop taking it if it may still help.  Thanks
I	much.	I have 12mg altogether, but 6mg is for the return flight?It's for panic attacks, I was thinking of taking about 2mg 2 hours before, 2mg about 1 hour before and 2mg about 30 mins before, does that sounds about right?Way less concerned about it being too much. 
My legs are in such rough shape	the lack of sleep so my body hasn't recovered fully	Well it's only been 22 days but I have more hope than I ever imagined.  I go back to work tomorrow which will be different but I am trying to keep positive.  Mentally I am still kind of broken.  Lonely and drained.  But I've been taking walks every day or every other day for 2. 5 to 3 miles.   <e1> My legs are in such rough shape </e1>  but I think it's due to  <e2> the lack of sleep so my body hasn't recovered fully </e2> .  I'm drinking a lot of water and all that.  I have good days and bad days like everyone else.  I had a really bad craving to use opiates last night but I chose a soda instead.  I'm glad I did.  I feel I am too far to look back now.  I feel like if I got a good nights rest I'd be the happiest guy in the entire Universe. 
I still was more nervous than I've ever been in recent memory	I could hardly keep my voice from cracking	All the preparation in the world and  <e1> I still was more nervous than I've ever been in recent memory </e1> .   <e2> I could hardly keep my voice from cracking </e2> . I also got my referral to a psychiatrist today! (A mandatory part of treatment in Australia. ) I cannot put into words how relieved I feel, knowing that at least the process has started. Just needed to vent that to people that understand. :)
Mental	please.	Mental images of a bullet casing, escaping, grazing my tormented skull.  Knife wounds a hundred times in my chest. I'm in pain.  These suicidal thoughts grow stronger every night.  How I hate myself, and my choices.  Rip my soul from my body and set me free.  The pain of this flesh is haunting me.  On my 20th birthday here I lay, and I crave nothing more than death.  I want a new life.  Reincarnate with another chance to not hurt others or myself.  I want to bleed out.  I want to bleed out and choke on my own blood as I gasp for air and swallow the regret of taking my own life.  I want to feel my own life slip away from me, so that in those few moments before death, I may rest easy knowing it's over.  I want to die.  Now, please.

Turning	universe	Turning 34 next month and a message to all you young folk who think that if they work hard, believe in yourself, try your best, and all that other rubbish your life will get better. It doesn't.  Surprise! You will still be single.  You will still be miserable every waking moment.  You will have that tight knot of sadness choke you for most of the day.  You will watch all of the people you know get married and have kids and lead happy lives.  You will waste countless hours at a job you hate.  You will watch your parents grow increasingly depressed at the loser of a person you've turned out to be.  You will pray for cancer and random violent accidents to end your life.  You will desperately cling to different forms of ways to disconnect ranging from alcohol to hard drugs even if it means forgetting about life for just a few minutes. Now you may be thinking, Well then universe
Was in a relationship for 2 1/2 years.  Boyfriend just broke it off	Went from numb to crying	Chronic anxiety and depression here.  Also possible borderline personality disorder.   <e1> Was in a relationship for 2 1/2 years.  Boyfriend just broke it off </e1>  (I just got home from work. . . we work at the same job.  Broke it off in the car. ) after a long time of him being very forgiving and patient with me, more than anyone else.  I can't blame him for finally thinking for himself. I'm numb now.  He was my support system when I had my suicidal episodes.  I'm putting in my two weeks tomorrow, and from then on I'll figure out a good time to do this.  In the meantime, I'll beat myself up and starve myself like I used to.  I deserved all of this and I'm sorry for hurting you, especially when you were the only one who stood by me through everything.  I should be focusing on winning you back, but I'm focusing on offing myself instead.  You were completely right about everything. You deserve better and I love you.  Don't be mad at me when you find out. Update:  <e2> Went from numb to crying </e2> .  Fuck. 
I see them as just my mind's way of tricking me into playing	I'm depriving it of what it wants (dopamine/the rush from the game, etc)	I have some rather amusing things happen personally.   <e1> I see them as just my mind's way of tricking me into playing </e1> , because  <e2> I'm depriving it of what it wants (dopamine/the rush from the game, etc) </e2> .  I figured it might help me to write a few of them down here. One is that I will hear many of the sound effects from Dota 2 in real life
My	it	My doctor and I decided to take me off of Cymbalta after two years of being on it, and we're going to try Saphris instead.   I'm on a lot of other meds (trileptal, vyvanse, adderall, cymbalta, buspar) but we believe the Invega is causing a lot of the symptoms I don't like.   I'm just. . . flat.   I've been very very depressed for a long time, and haven't had any mania in at least a year.   My brain is cripplingly foggy and I'm constantly tired, along with being very irritable.   I've been reading some reviews on Saphris and many of them say that they've had great results switching from Invega to Saphris.   Doesn't make them drowsy, makes the irritability cease, makes them feel much more awake and aware than they were on other meds.   Has anyone else tried it
Short	hours	Short CLIFFS: Known about my ADHD my whole life, finally decided something was wrong, got adderall, made me feel wired, then tried vyvanse, made me feel good and a little wired for 4 hours, then i would crash.  I then added a 2nd dose around 3pm, finally felt good from 9am-9pm, perfect week, got so much done.  Come Next Week! Worst Week every, i could fall asleep so easily, but i couldn't stay sleeping.  3-4 hours a night, even this wonder drug couldn't keep me going.  I got an Ulcer, felt unsocial, I just had to quit cold turkey.  Present Day: Cliff Solutions:Is Vyvanse Not possible for me? as I eed a 2nd dose.  The reason i say that is 30mg is perfect but only lasts 4 hours
Im	:)	Im forty days in! It's such a huge difference in how I feel.  I finally feel balanced and stable.  No more death defying highs and lows during the day. I am much more relaxed, better focus.  Most importantly I am much more content with my situation.  I have let go of my resentments, learning to be a better person.  I am not perfect and sometimes I feel bad, sometimes I'm jealous, sometimes I'm sad and lonely. But it is ok.  It is OK, it's not a quick-fix, I'm not floating on a pink cloud nor have all my problems been resolved but I am better equipped to deal with anything now. And for that I am happy :)Also I want to start doing yoga, would be happy to hear some experiences how that works with starting in a group and such.  I know nothing about that :)
I can't work minimum wage jobs	all the anxiety attacks	What do you guys do for money?  <e1> I can't work minimum wage jobs </e1>  because of  <e2> all the anxiety attacks </e2> , and am currently living on six hundred a month via social security.  Crashing with my only real friend, also on ssi, and I'm hungry and my anxiety is getting worse the longer I lack stability.  I'm anxious and hungry and want to hear some positive stories!
I	really	I have severe, severe depression.   Have for years and years, not just im sad today. 1.   I have no health insurance2.   I am very poor3.   I live in Austin TXWhat options are available?  Like really
Currently	depression?	Currently Sick Of It, and Monster, both by Skillet describe pretty well how I'm feeling.  When I get depressed I turn to angsty teen music even now that I'm 17, but at least I got away from the Three Days Grace phase.  I have been in a deep anxiety/depression combo spiral down for a while and 2 months ago finally hit rock bottom, and Survive by Sick Puppies is the song that made me want to start fighting, not sure why it just clicked.  What are some of your experiences with music helping you deal with depression?
I'm not really satisfied with that diagnoses	DSM stuff says an episode lasts a year at the longest	Hello, I am a 20 year old woman here who has experienced depression since I was ~13.  But  <e1> I'm not really satisfied with that diagnoses </e1> , since  <e2> DSM stuff says an episode lasts a year at the longest </e2> .  I have suggested dysthymia to my psychiatrist as a new diagnoses, but she denies it since, dysthymia symptoms aren't bad enough to be thought of as depression.  She thinks I've had something along the line of three subsequent episodes of depression
So	example	So I have a friend that I've recently become pretty close with.  She's very social and fun to be around, but sometimes she does things that really get to me. She is extremely privileged and has a tendency to brag about things without realizing it.  This mostly affects another friend (also quite privileged) because she has pretty strict parents (mostly her dad).  The thing about this is that when my friends get sad or anxious I do too.  And this causes Friend B to get upset so I do too. Friend A also pressures me into situations she knows I'm uncomfortable with.  I'm kind of the baby of my group and don't want to drink or smoke (weed) with them but she says stuff like my life goal is to get Meowria drunk.  It's gotten to the point where I can't tell whether or not she's joking.  The weird thing about this is that she has actually been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and takes meds for it.  I don't get why she doesn't understand how much her behavior affects me. She also doesn't seem to understand when a joke isn't funny anymore.  For example
the anxiety	waiting for my acceptance decision	There are a lot of different things going on in my life right now.  I'm dealing with trying to transfer to a different college (and  <e1> the anxiety </e1>  with  <e2> waiting for my acceptance decision </e2> ), trying to find someone to take over my apartment lease, and trying to transfer jobs.  My brain feels like it is stuck in a loop just thinking about these things over and over.  I hate being stuck in limbo and not knowing about what is going to come in the future, and I don't know how to handle this.  I'm so worried about not being accepted at this college, and I don't think I'll find out for like a month, and I don't know what I would do if they reject me. 
So	star	So some of you (Maybe 20 in total) may have seen my last post on here about 1 month being porn free and what changed, and well I have a small question.  I ended up getting to 103 days but I think I deserved to reset my counter and here is why. . . . I mentioned in my last post that I managed to get a girl friend, after about a month of going PMO free, and we are still very happy together and this is where my question comes in.  I saw a video on /r/sex called Nina Hartley's guide to eating pu**y The video was 18+ (obviously) but it wasn't porn like you would think.  It was Ms.  Hartley and some other porn star
First	me	First off, I know I have the correct diagnosis.  I take my medication everyday.  But sometimes I feel like it is all in my head.  Like maybe I am making it all up.  My friend (who is a therapist and is licensed to diagnose people) said that she really didn't see me cycle.  She doesn't notice the hypomania but she does notice the depression.  That was last year. . she finally got to see me go through a hypo manic episode (it was a mixed episode so it was not a awesome time).  Sometimes I think why do I feel these things? Nothing horrible happened in my past.  Sure I was bullied but there are worse things I get mad at myself and start to worry that maybe nothing is wrong with me
I'm	life	I'm not confortable talking to people about me, nobody knows my life, even my closest friends.  But now, I just feel like writing, and reading your stories makes me feel less sad and i remember that i'm not alone, suffering. It's been as long as i can remember that i hated (my) life, the first time i really wanted to die was when i was 11, but i never had the courage to do it.  I'm not even scared of death, it's more the what if it fails? that scares me.  I failed so much in my life
I recently got scammed	I am really pissed off	Hi and thanks for reading.   <e1> I recently got scammed </e1>  and  <e2> I am really pissed off </e2> .  I am usually very docile but I have no intention of letting this slide.  I have ways of hurting (legal) the person that did this to myself and my daughters. . . she knew I don't have a lot extra but she didn't care. I am so damn mad and I've never felt this much anger before. . . I'm not sure how far to take it and if I will know when it's time to let it go.  Thanks. . . any suggestions are welcome!
Curious	job?	Curious what people here think about this: askamanager. org/2015/06/i-racked-up-20000-in-personal-charges-on-my-company-credit-card. html# commentsOn the one hand, I've seen versions of this play out with many ADHD people in my life, from having cars repo'd to bank accounts frozen to ruined relationships over owed money.  But I don't know if I've ever seen it cross over into potentially criminal territory (embezzling/wire fraud).  It sounds like this guy has issues both with impulsivity/trouble planning but also financial illiteracy. If this was someone you knew, like your friend or relative, what would you tell them? If you were their employer, knowing how their actions could be related to ADHD, would you fire them or try to help them repay the money and keep their job? 
my lack of focus and energy	make the same mistakes  again and again	When I was little I really liked playing sports, but I realized the older that I got,  that  <e1> my lack of focus and energy </e1>  would cause me to  <e2> make the same mistakes  again and again </e2> .   Even if someone would try to show me or correct my form, I still wouldn't be able to do it right.   This would cause a frustrating situation and make me want to stop all together.   Because of so many bad experiences with this problem, I have decided to avoid pretty much all team sports and competition.  Even with certain video games, I can't get the basics down and keep losing which is boring for the other player and makes me feel worthless. 
I have stayed dry	I have had trouble sleeping, I was throwing up yesterday (not sure if related) and felt very feverish	[I posted here beginning of the week]( reddit. com/r/stopdrinking/comments/381toe/coming_out_of_lurking_for_over_2_years_please_help/). . .  -- <e1> I have stayed dry </e1> .  It's been really hard, and I think I've been pretty snappy at my boyfriend.   <e2> I have had trouble sleeping, I was throwing up yesterday (not sure if related) and felt very feverish </e2> .  Boyfriend said I was burning up when I felt cold as ice.  I feel a little better today, but I don't know if stopping is the cause, or if it's just exacerbating a nasty cold.  -But, I haven't had a drink.  Tonight we go over to his parents' house for BBQ and I know there will be beer or wine.  My throat is getting dry and tight thinking about the possiblity of a drink, but I don't want to give in.  I really want to prove to myself that I can do this.  -I haven't decided if 100% sobriety is for me or if I need to spend the next portion of this year simply proving I'm strong enough to abstain, but I know that today, I will not drink. -Thanks guys. 
Hello,	all?	Hello, I am a (in three weeks) 15 year old male who has a sexting addiction.  The last time I relapsed was May 3rd, but I came verrrryy close today.  What I will do sometimes is create new kik accounts and find people who would want to sext with me.  Lately, I will just chat with them for sexual pleasure, but I feel just as guilty as though I did if I officially relapsed.  I have been doing well lately, but every once and a while this comes around and kicks my ass.  For those of you who have had sex addictions (not just sexting), any advice? What should I do to kick this SOB once and for all? 
This	haha.	This is really weird but whenever I'm really sad my sense of humor tends to go haywire.  I laugh TOO MUCH as if to compensate for the sadness I feel inside.  For example, I'm the person that is left laughing after everyone's already done, I'm known as the happy friend.  Literally I cried once when we were watching a movie and my friends were so surprised, they told me they had never seen me in a bad/sad/angry mood.  They told me I was always happy and laughing. Maybe I should become an actress haha.

Ok	depressed	Ok so here goes. For a long time I had tried to ough it out with my depression and other mental problems.  I sought treatment and feel so much better.  I don't even remember how it felt when I was depressed
I	again?	I am somewhat new to the whole anxiety thing.  I've had it for a few years but in the past couple of months it has gotten worse.  I have already missed work or had to leave early several days and I can't afford to do it again anytime soon. I am on 15mg of Buspar a day and I feel like it helps lower my overall general anxiety but if I start freaking out or having a panic attack I might as well be taking breath mints. I've already started having a health anxiety related panic attack at work tonight but it's kind of mild compared to how some of my attacks are.  What can I do to try to calm down until I can see my doctor or a therapist again?
I've	well!	I've been coding a long time, and, up until my diagnosis, I had no indication that I had adhd.  Now that I am aware and have spent a lot of time understanding it, I can spot patterns in my working habits that contribute to procrastination, losing focus entirely for long stretches, etc. One example would be when compiling or building code, installing packages, etc.  where I am stuck in my tracks until it finishes.  In these situations I often, almost unconsciously, head to reddit or facebook or something.  Then I'll see a neat article or 20, comment on a friend's post, etc.  Before I know it I've got 20+ tabs open and an hour has passed, meanwhile whatever it is I had been doing has long finished and my train of thought is gone. So, what types of things do you do to stay on task? Any particularly good strategies? How do you distract yourself during these downtime moments that last from 1 to 5 minutes without letting the adhd take over and getting lost in something like Reddit?For those who aren't in software but have similar issues at your job, I'm happy to receive your input, as well!
As	reading.	As the title says, I don't like life and I don't want to live.  I don't have family or friends that can be hurt, nothing will be left behind. I just want to know if there is something else out there I can't see.  I feel indifferent about all things people say it makes life beautiful. Thank you for reading. 
I'm	winning.	I'm sure this probably gets asked all the time.  I've been having a very difficult time getting out of a suicidal depression lately.  It's consuming me.  I can think of a hundred different reasons to die and two reasons to stay alive.  I've been in the hospital multiple times, been on several different meds, tried CBT and DBT.  There's only one way out.  I'm fucking trying but I'm not winning. 
Came	day1	Came here to say I'm glad this username has not been taken.   It sums up how I feel about my problem.   Not yet ready to use my regular account but hopefully this sub will be seeing more of me as I fight to recover.   # day1
For	why.	For the most part, when in public or when talking to parents and other family members, even if I'm VERY angry about something, I can hold in my anger for quite a while.  But when I'm with my two brothers, anything they do for some reason, it just pisses me off so much.  If they leave the door to the kitchen open after getting something, I can close it for them maybe the first two times, but after that, I get angry as hell and yell pretty much at the top of my lungs.  I've even gone as far as to hurt them (nothing serious, punches on the back and pressure points) and I'm sure if I don't do something, I might do something more serious.  I'm not kidding here.  My brothers can do almost anything and it is like a trigger and i get SO ANGRY and I don't realize it until after I've let it out.  I'm not angry at all whilst typing this, but if my brothers were to walk in I would suddenly become extremely angry/irratable out of nowhere.  I don't know why. 
Those	:)	Those of you who suffered with anxiety, social anxiety, depression as well as adhd, what was your journey as far as treatment with meds goes?Did you start with anti-depressants to get better emotionally, was it notice-able? Did you then later cope with adhd with or without meds, or did you start with those first and realized anxiety and depr.  tapered down once you got your life more under control and gained confidence?Where are you right now?Please include med types and the dosage used (if it's not too much of a hassle) :)
Hey	experience.	Hey guys, a little over 30 days sober and just discovered this subreddit.  Did anyone else not have dreams during the time they smoked daily/went to bed high? Maybe that was the alcohol as I am an alcoholic and harder drug addict as well but I woke up this morning after having the most vivid and amazing dream I've had in more than 6 years! Was just happy and wanted to see if there were others with the same experience.  
I was diagnosed in office by my pyschaitrist a few months ago	I looked over some gre practice tests and the tests aren't difficult but I am the worst when I have to do things very quickly	So  <e1> I was diagnosed in office by my pyschaitrist a few months ago </e1> .  I'm certain my parents were ignoring my Adhd from my early youth.  I looked at the GRE requirements for a diagnosis and they seem harsh.  I can't afford a lot right now as money is really tight and I doubt my insurance will cover anything that isn't completely necessary.   <e2> I looked over some gre practice tests and the tests aren't difficult but I am the worst when I have to do things very quickly </e2> .  I'll either get super focused on one problem and waste time or I do it too quickly trying to save time and mess up the questions.  I had to take the sat a bunch of times to get decent scores on the separate sections.  &amp;nbsp;Tldr : What is the easiest way to get the GRE to accept my diagnosis so I can get a little extra time? &amp;nbsp;EDIT: i live in NYC fyi
It's	ish	It's been 365 days since she looked up from a tear stained letter and told me she loved me too. . .  It was a moment of pure happiness for me and now months after we have broken up I am completely blocked out her life.  Usually I would use this as a trigger or excuse to get drunk. . .  But not tonight I just got a haircut and I'm sitting in and reading articles in order to get my mind together before I go back to college in September.  I have been invited to 2 different events and I am sad I am missing them but I have resolve.  It has only been 5 days since I last had a drink and I haven't seen too much benifits yet but I'm happy. . . ish
I removed all meds over this summer	I'm only taking one class and wanted to see if there was better doseage to go about my days with a lower IR form and no more Lexapro	I have been prescribed Adderall 25 MG XR throughout my past year in law school with Lexapro 10 MG to counter the anxiety sides.   <e1> I removed all meds over this summer </e1>  because  <e2> I'm only taking one class and wanted to see if there was better doseage to go about my days with a lower IR form and no more Lexapro </e2> .  I switched down to Adderall 10 MG IR, but it doesn't last all day and I don't feel like the aggressive go-getter I use to be.  Is it possible the Adderall 25 MG XR without the Lexapro was the right answer, or is a lower IR dose (possibly 15 MG IR) better? Just wanted opinions of people who've been on same doses in school.  Thank you!
I find that i'm afraid of leaving the house	the urge of needing to use the toilet	Hey guys i was wondering whether or not anyone else faces this issue?  <e1> I find that i'm afraid of leaving the house </e1>  due to  <e2> the urge of needing to use the toilet </e2> .

I constantly obsess over it, and this odd feeling of time flying by is what worries me the most	I cannot stop obsessing over these thoughts, and I currently feel extremely worried and scared of the future and the passage of time	Hey, I was looking for advice on how to stop worrying about the future.   <e1> I constantly obsess over it, and this odd feeling of time flying by is what worries me the most </e1> .  Like, last weekend just felt like yesterday, and now that it's Monday, I feel like the weekends will come and go so quickly, and it will be the holidays and then the end and then the cycle repeats.   <e2> I cannot stop obsessing over these thoughts, and I currently feel extremely worried and scared of the future and the passage of time </e2> . I was looking for advice as to how to stop these obsessive thoughts, and how to enjoy my time as it goes.  If this cannot be, how can I create the feeling of slower time?Thanks.  
Hi	tips?	Hi there, I may be the only person who is this way; or perhaps I'm not.  I had a problem which made me anxious.  This problem has a solution, and I've received an over-abundance of reassurance that the problem has been solved and/or can be solved.  Regardless of how much evidence there is before me that this problem is solved or won't occur again; I still dwell (read, crushing anxiety) on things such as: - what potentially could go wrong;- what if things dont work out; - what if I'm anxious about this forever. .  - I'm anxious about being anxious. . .  - I fear my anxiety will make the problem worse. . .  I don't need to go into the problem; as I could apply this line of worry to anything in my life that bothers me.  Has anyone else ever worried about something so much, even after being told that everything will be OK? It's a major negative though process, and accepting someones assurance should be more than enough to placate my worry, but I can't seem to let it go.  Any tips? 
I am hesitant to attribute anything positive to ADHD	I think it is truly awful if the modern understanding of this disorder is correct	 <e1> I am hesitant to attribute anything positive to ADHD </e1> , because  <e2> I think it is truly awful if the modern understanding of this disorder is correct </e2> .  There is nothing about it I like or would keep, given the choice. However, one interesting side effect of the disorder is that it keeps me honest.  Because I can't pay attention to anything that isn't worthwhile or beneficial.  I can't force myself.  If something isn't inherently worth doing
I'd say that it's easier to be a Christian in recovery	you have something tangible in viewing Jesus Christ as your Higher Power	This might be an odd question, but are there any other UUs out there who are in recovery? When I entered the rooms of NA back in 2012, I started attending services at a UU congregation.  It helped a lot.  However, I always see Christian approaches and Buddhist approaches to recovery and a Higher Power.   <e1> I'd say that it's easier to be a Christian in recovery </e1>  because  <e2> you have something tangible in viewing Jesus Christ as your Higher Power </e2> .  I'm not too familiar with the Buddhist philosophy of a higher power but I do own a 12 Step book based on Buddhism.  But what about UUs? If you are one in recovery how has your congregation helped you become happy
my psych diagnosed me with depression	what was making me sad was my body image	 <e1> my psych diagnosed me with depression </e1>  and at the end of the day, i realized  <e2> what was making me sad was my body image </e2> .  despite everything else ive done, i truly believe that my inability to love myself is rooted in my physical insecurity (fat kid growing up, no attention from the opposite sex) im 6'0, 173 and a competitive fighter, but to be honest, im still not happy with my physique and it makes me sad and if im bloated with water on certain days or i ate more than i should have, i dont want to see anyone and i get self conscious. i keep thinking if i just get the ripped body i always fantasized about as a fat high school kid, ill be happy

So I just wanted some tips or anything for how I can manage to talk about my depression. 
My	statements	My girlfriend has dealt with binging and restricting for nearly 20 years.  She experiences the feelings of being overwhelmed about things I have come to consider 'normal parts of being an adult. ' Most recently, she graduated from a clinic for others suffering similar issues.  She struggles with her body image and has the most severe shame-spiral reactions I've ever seen in a person.  I'd like to be able to have conversations about the hard stuff, and I'm okay if I have to ease into them, but I know that if I ignore the conversations for her benefit, I will grow resentful of not being able to share my feelngs. We practice I statements
A	jobs?	A key part of dealing with ADHD is knowing that it is easier to break larger projects down into small steps with small regular rewards vs having a singular larger reward at the end.  In a way, being paid hourly is like a little reward every hour, whereas a salary is a larger lump of money but on fewer intervals.  Would you say that hourly paying jobs are easier to stay motivated in than salaried jobs?
I got this small forest in my back yard and it needs to be cleared out.   I am far to lazy to do it the normal cut shit down and cut it up and all that bullshit	I've come up with an idea for some kind of unholy cross between a snowblower garden tiller and lawn mower	For me it's building shit, mainly catapults and potato guns or things that are in generally overly complicated way to over powered and super dangerous.   Anyways  <e1> I got this small forest in my back yard and it needs to be cleared out.   I am far to lazy to do it the normal cut shit down and cut it up and all that bullshit </e1> .   So  <e2> I've come up with an idea for some kind of unholy cross between a snowblower garden tiller and lawn mower </e2> .  Now I just need to find some one to design it.    and yeah I just had to tell some people about this. 
I end up not working, missing out on social activities	I made time to work but fail to my thoughts bounce around like a rabid pinball	So.  I've finally been officially diagnosed with ADHD after years of being stuck behind my studies, failing university, getting so anxious on working that  <e1> I end up not working, missing out on social activities </e1>  because  <e2> I made time to work but fail to my thoughts bounce around like a rabid pinball </e2> . . .  well you know the deal.  (Though I would suppose I was fortunate to be diagnosed at 21 which is considerably earlier than other people)Anyway.  I'd like to ask you guys about your various experiences in fixing your lives and perhaps some recommendations about how I could fix mine, like time management apps and the like.  (I apologise if the question is a little broad) Also, I'm starting with dexamphetamine as prescribed by my psychiatrist, currently in the process of testing out the right dosage for me.  I'd love it if some of you could elaborate your experiences with this drug.  Thanks in advance.  A lot. 
And	me.	And it scares me.  I'm broke and can't afford my meds, and it's getting to me.  I feel confused most of all.  Just letting you guys know, feel free to ignore me.  
I started getting stomach pain	everytime I freak out, I get constipated	I have never posted here before, but here is why I am freaking out.  So I started having a chest pain on the right side of my chest and o thought nothing.  So I looked up the symptoms and I read a story about a girl who died instantly and she was 19, then I saw a boy who was 16 and died from it, and then  <e1> I started getting stomach pain </e1>  (because  <e2> everytime I freak out, I get constipated </e2> ).  Haven't been able to sleep and I'm scared.  I also get bloated with excess gas and don't have the best diet.  I'm not as inactive as I ised to be because I was homeschooled for a year and a half so, I need help to calm down.  I'm going to the doctor today to see if it isn't because even though it is rare, I feel like I have contributed to it.  I also have bad acid reflux everytime I eat and drink something I shouldn't.  So help please.  
Some how I am still keeping my cool	I know if I allow myself to get angry I will enter into that negative thought process	I wont get into the back story because its way to hard to explain but this is how my morning started.  My wife and kids took me to my truck this morning so I could go to work and when we pull up my son asks me what happened to my door handle.  I look over to see the handle completely gone.  Someone had broken into my truck.  After getting in to inspect what was stolen I see the ignition ripped open.  This wasn't just a break in, someone had tried to actually steal my truck.  The dome light had been busted out and everything was torn apart.  The ignition is now so fucked up that my key wont start it.   <e1> Some how I am still keeping my cool </e1> .   <e2> I know if I allow myself to get angry I will enter into that negative thought process </e2> .  Even though all this shit happened, I will not drink today.

Since then, I've been through a significantly depressive episode, complete with trial &amp; error med changes.  Now, I'm slowly coming out of the depression.  Do you think it is too soon to start dating? A big part of my depressive thinking centers around being single and also not having many friends.  
I'm	thoughts.	I'm on day 46 and most of the time it has been pretty easy not to smoke. The thing is, that i have such good memories of smoking.  When i think about cigarettes i don't think that it's disgusting to smoke, like nonsmokers obviously do. This may seem weird, but I dreamt of smoking a cig about once a week since i stopped.  The first weeks I felt guilty in my dream and threw it away, last week I finished it^^. What do you guys think? Could this be the first dangerous phase to start again? Is this even a phase? Did you have similar experiences 1 and a half month in? Will the positive feeling about cigarettes ever go away?Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Do any of you carry around a daily notebook/pad to keep things organized? I find that when I actually take the time to write things down neatly, it seems to calm everything down.

my relationship is spiraling out of control	I still look at porn, but shit it's so embarassing that i clear it.  She takes it as clearing my tracks for naughty picture trading	Porn addict or just a shitty person. . .   <e1> my relationship is spiraling out of control </e1> .  For 4 years I have dragged a wonderful woman through the wake of my lies and deceit.  Neither of us want to let go, but I'm afraid it's too late.  I had an obsessive addiction to naughty online chat rooms and picture trading.  I had the hardest time stoppong, but I feel I've found a way out.  But my nervous habits of clearing search histories re opens and ugly wound every time she searches through my phone to find nothing.   <e2> I still look at porn, but shit it's so embarassing that i clear it.  She takes it as clearing my tracks for naughty picture trading </e2> .  Other than the obvious get real and get out leave her alone option. . . . I just need a release. . . . or something.   Help me. . . Tldr no good bf can't shake past of cheating and relationship falling apart. 
Okay	Afterwards	Okay so three things have concerned me recently, and I'm wondering if it's just a typical experience of anxiety or something more serious to check out. I sometimes get unbearably overwhelmed with depression very suddenly and can't even stand, so these usually happen while huddled on my floor.  I am probably bad at coping.  1.  I have vivid, intense internal conversations with myself, but they're so. . .  Uncontrolled.  It's like there's multiple entirely distinct trains of thought conversing in my head.  I know they are me, but they interrupt each other and all have different agendas.  They refer to me and eachother by name.  I tell them to get out of my head.  Their names are all my name.  Afterwards
in the morning i feel disgusted and even more motivated	i class myself as a non smoker	I have had around 5 cigarettes in the time 25 days i have been cigarette free (lol).  This is only when i drink i give in,  <e1> in the morning i feel disgusted and even more motivated </e1>  -  <e2> i class myself as a non smoker </e2> .  Does anyone have any advice besides stopping drinking?
my line of work	I can typically smoke whenever I want	I've finally have made the decision to attempt to quit again, and unfortunately during the most stressful time of my life for various reasons I'd rather not discuss.  I've tried vaping, chantix made me insane, and nicotine gum just made me puke.  I've tried to read the Allen Carr book, but the way it was written was mind numbing to me.  I'm thinking of trying patches this time around but don't know where to start with them.  I've been smoking from the time I was 17 and am now 35 and nowadays I tend to smoke a pack and a half a day.  Currently I'm trying to reduce my smoking by whatever amount I can by just telling myself to wait a little longer before I have one.  It doesn't help that due to  <e1> my line of work </e1>   <e2> I can typically smoke whenever I want </e2> .   Really just looking for advice for stepping down with the patches and an app to help me keep track. 
When i snap out of it, sometimes i feel the need to end a meal	it's tedious to continue to eat	I wonder if this is an adhd thing, do you resonate?Basically i often sit down at the dining table, start eating, start getting completely lost in thought and from there:.  my thought flow has accelerated to such a degree that i'm completely out of the present moment and my eating is following it without me realizing (i'm stuffing food and eating REALLY fast).  <e1> When i snap out of it, sometimes i feel the need to end a meal </e1>  because  <e2> it's tedious to continue to eat </e2> ? (not sure what i really feel there).  If i am alone it is a lot more likely to happen, and trying to resist falling into the thoughts and stay in the present creates anxiety in my stomach and restlessness. .  i just start pacing around and it feels so natural and comfortable.  I walk around the kitchen with absolutely no purpose and i'm eating something simultaneously and i'm just thinking about random stuff. . .   The pacing around makes the empo of the whole thing more comfortable and i don't get anxiety. It's as if its my natural state

I don't know, i just felt the need to share and get some advice from you all.  I'm not chomping at the bit to get a drink but the thoughts are there and i just had to tell someone who understands, she usually would have been the one to listen to me. . . i feel like I'm ranting now.  Thanks for listening
Tell	Please.	Tell me what's so good about having low GPA, no secured future, divorced parents, the only other person besides my mom getting money is me, living in a household that is always breaking and I'm the one that has to pay for it and i s living with 3 other siblings; One older and two younger brother/sister that constantly annoy you and doesn't do any work.

I	side.	I thought I would feel better When I joined the military.  I thought it would make me feel loved and worth something.  I thought I would be noticed. And I sit here on my 21st birthday, on a 24 hour shift that no one would cover for me.  No wishes. Just sitting here.  I wonder why I'm not loved.  What did I do to make everyone ignore me? They ask what superpower you would have, but I already have invisibility.  I cannot connect to people.  I have tried everything.  I don't have any hope.  No beliefs.  Nothing.  I wonder why every day.  Why am I even here?If I'm not happy and cannot change it without death, then why am I alive?I look forward to the unknown of death.  It's more appealing than the known.  I am just treated like shit.  Beat down and hurt. So why am I here? I probably even posted in the wrong subreddit.  I can say I tried, and failed.  I thought it would all get better.  But the grass is dead on the other side.  
I can be blinded by my room	because the sun shines in at full force every day, but I can still sleep through it	For this upcoming school year, I desperately want to do better in school but it's really hard (and it sounds stupid) for me to wake up.    <e1> I can be blinded by my room </e1> ,  <e2> because the sun shines in at full force every day, but I can still sleep through it </e2> .   I fall into this vicious cycle of sleeping late, and being unable to sleep and either missing class or zoning out because I lack sleep.   I'm primarily a night person. . .  and it's hard for me to be alert any time before 10/11am.   I've tried just about everything but I always come back to this cycle.   For some reason, (and  I think it's my anxiety) I can't ever fall asleep unless I'm drained.   Any suggestions?Edit: Thanks everyone for your suggestions! Even I didn't personally respond, I appreciate it all.  I'll let you know if it works out.   I hope it will.  :D
I	existed.	I feel like such a burden to everyone around me.  I've been diagnosed with MDD when I was 17, and now, 3 years later and I feel exactly in the same place.  No amount of meds or hospitalization or therapy can stop me from constantly trying to plan my own death.  Unfortunately, I don't have enough pills to ensure my death in my sleep.  I'm currently living at my girlfriends parents house, sleeping on a blow up matress and spending all day switching between video games and TV, trying to find something to occupy my time.  But I'm not like a lot of people on this sub.  I have a girlfriend who loves me, friends who care about me, people who know I'm depressed and do everything they can to help.  But nothing works.  I wish I didn't have to deal with this anymore.  I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, but I could never do that to the people who care about me.  I wish I never existed. 
I've	Thanks.	I've been Adderall now about six days and I still don't quite feel right.  It helps with concentration, but I don't quite feel my best.  I was on 20 mg a day and cut down to 10 mg today.  I don't want to quit too early before my body adjusts, but at the same time I realize this drug may not be for everyone.  Thanks. 
Does	again.	Does anyone ever get super down after visiting parents for the weekend? I've lived on my own for a few years now, but every time I leave it feels like I'm leaving for the first time again. 
I've	out	I've been depressed for as long as I can remember.  Every now and again I get sick of always feeling like shit, and have one of those No.  I am not going to put up with this anymore.  I am going to change things! moments and try and sort my life out

talking to/drinking with these people and I don't know what to do	I feel so anxious	Hey reddit! This is my first post, so please bear with me. I struggle with moderate social anxiety, and being put in a situation where everyone knows each other and I only know one or two people is pretty much my worst nightmare. My boyfriend's best friend, whom I have met, is throwing a house party in 2 days.  My boyfriend will know most of the people invited, as it is mostly people from their extensive friend group.  There will probably be 20 to 25 people there and I don't want to end up clinging to my boyfriend all night, but  <e2> I feel so anxious </e2>  about  <e1> talking to/drinking with these people and I don't know what to do </e1> . Making it even more complicated, my boyfriend and his friend (basically the only 2 people I'd feel comfortable talking to) will be DJing the party, so I'll be on my own for most of the night. I just need some tips on getting through this night--my boyfriend is really looking forward to it and I don't want to back out of yet another event just because I'm nervous.  Has anyone been in a similar situation?

Like when you do something slightly wrong and affects another person or just from driving in general.  I know this happens to me and sometimes I almost shut down from it and can barely drive anymore.   Was just wondering if this is something that happens to anybody else or if I'm alone in this. 
I	know.	I just turned 21.  My whole family is dead, I don't have a job, it's hard for me to be interested in things. I was planning on going back to college in the fall and getting a part-time job.  But I am concerned that I will probably never have a job that I enjoy, or even on that I can support myself on. I really don't enjoy anything, I don't get up in the morning feeling like there is something I want to do.  So I don't know. 
since i had missed so many days	i was forced to go on independent study (home school, basically)	when i was 15, i began pretending to be sick to get out of school, just occasionally.  this turned into me doing it a couple of days in a row every other week, and soon enough,  <e1> since i had missed so many days </e1> ,  <e2> i was forced to go on independent study (home school, basically) </e2> .  at first this was a dream come true, i can sleep in, do whatever i want for the entire day, and still hang out with friends when they got out of school.  this was my freshman year of highschool.  as sophomore year started, i began to become distant with my friends from school.  i started making much more internet friends (reddit, different gaming communities, etc. ), and i soon stopped talking to my friends from school altogether.  after about a month of that, i began getting texts like are you dead? XD or are you ever coming back?.  i did not answer these. i am now 18 and after 3 years of being an isolated hermit
One	Reddit.	One of the only perks to having ADHD is the double-edged sword and being able to hyperfocus.  After reading all your guys' lovely answers, I tried all those options out and everyday since that post, I've been using melatonin, waking up incrementally earlier, eating earlier, and cutting caffeine out at 5pm, and it happened. . .  I woke up naturally for the first time in a very long time.   I even fall asleep earlier! I know this is just motivated right now by my impulsive personality of wanting to do this, but I just feel so happy knowing some solutions and actually doing it.  It'll be a test of time to see if I can keep it up, but for now I feel like I'll actually make it to classes now.  Thanks Reddit. 
I am always worried	my job	I'm a 26 years old man.  I beleive I'm healthy but I have some anxiety problems.   <e1> I am always worried </e1>  because of  <e2> my job </e2> .  I'm working as an accountant  and I'm always worried about every little problem.  When one gets resolved and I could be relieved I find a new one shortly and I'm stressed again.  It's not hard to find something to worry about in my job. Sometimes I can't fall asleep or wake up early and thinking about this.  It greatly reduces the quality of my life. I'm looking for ways to stop this. 
So	it!	So happy it wasn't real! I woke up so stressed about it!
I	appreciated!	I just started taking Vyvanse today.  I haven't taken any ADHD meds for about 5 years.  I can definitely tell a difference right away but I am curious to know what other people's opinions of Vyvanse are.  What do you do guys like or dislike about it? Anything good or bad about compared to other medications? Any side effects to know about? Any feedback would be well appreciated!
I	it.	I feel like it has helped me.  It doesn't make me physically hyper, it makes me feel calm and I think I've been less depressed since I started taking it.  Like I don't sit around overthinking about everything, which is what usually leads to my terrible moods.  Does that sound like it's working properly? I really don't want to be taken off of it.  The only problem I've had is I get really worried about my heart rate (It hasn't even gone up a lot when I take the medication, though) and sometimes it gives me anxiety.  But I don't think the anxiety is a direct side effect of the adderall.  I've always had bad anxiety, especially about medicine or anything to do with medical stuff.  I feel like if I get my heart checked out and they say it's fine, this anxiety will go away, but I'm afraid this will make him unsure as to whether I should be on it. 
I'm	thing!	I'm on day 5 of quitting (yay!) and yesterday afternoon I started feeling sort of, loopy? Almost like having low blood sugar or a touch of vertigo.  Has this happened to anyone else?I would also like to thank this subreddit for being here.  All the positive encouragement is a really great thing!
We	Ok	We had a major life event in our family this week.   A death that rocked us all to our core.  Prior to diagnosis I'd have been wacky on sleep, eating crap, caring for everyone else, ignoring work, making excuses, and getting more and more anxious and depressed at fucking up. This week I made a concerted effort to:1.  Sleep 7-8 hours nightly; using melatonin every night even when I didn't think I needed it2.  kept up with my exercise routine.  Ok
I've	stop.	I've noticed that as my social and general anxiety has grown that I've grown more and more anxious about my health.  I flip out if there's even a hint of something going wrong.  And then when I end up googling even the tiniest of symptoms my mind starts racing and I basically shut down because of the panic and all rational thought flies through the window.  Anyone else have any trouble with this? If so, how do you attempt to control it? It's slowly taking over my life and it needs to stop. 
So	you	So I'm 18 and on summer holidays at the moment, I really need a job but thinking about applying for one and having one triggers really anxious feelings.  It's not the working side of it, or interacting with people, I have good social skills and a good work ethic.  it's the actual not being able to do the job properly and being Rubbish at it kind of deal- this happened in my last job as a waiter where I was under a lot of pressure, and I'm worried about letting my future boss/ employees down-   I obviously won't be applying to the same field of work.  Could someone please give me some advice in how to tackle this, I don't have anyone to talk to about it.  Thank you
Two	wrong.	Two days ago I developed a fever with no other symptoms.  At its highest it reached 38. 5 celsius.  Last night I randomly noticed a bunch of small swollen lumps on my neck that are sore.  Also the muscle in that area (from my left part of my neck to my shoulder) are intermittently sore.  My fever dropped today but is going back up again.  I went to the doctor (before I had noticed the lumps) who just checked my lungs and said they were clear and that I have the flu.  I think my lymph nodes are the things in my neck and I'm obsessively looking up symptoms of lymphoma.  They keep saying online that a lot of cancers start with a fever and I'm going crazy because my fever isn't accompanied with a sore throat or anything.  Please someone help calm me down.  I've never had swollen lymph nodes before I'm so scared that there's something wrong. 
So	me	So I'm new to the subreddit and haven't had a chance to read much but this is an official call for help.  My OCD basically comes in the form of what I've called broken record syndrome.  I will ask somebody (particularity my mother or wife) if they're either mad at me
I've	back.	I've done pretty well for a long time.   I have had the same group of friends for 5-8 years now.   Lately however I feel as if I am a burden on all of them.  I am guessing that it's all in my head, but I can't shake the feeling of being bad mouthed behind my back, or people just agreeing to hangout to appease me.   That's definitely not what I want.   I would much rather be left alone than pitied.   Sometimes my anxiety gets me so worked up I feel sick, and ready to vomit.   I can't for certain say that they hate/dislike me. .  but it feels that way.   Maybe I am picking up on things signals that aren't meant for me, maybe I'm paranoid. .  It seems like the right time to go back into hiding, and see if anyone is left when I come back.  
My ex continued talking to me almost every day, it was nice	I still felt like she needed me	4 months ago my S. O.  left me for reasons undisclosed.  I guess she got bored with me, my last 2 relationships quoted that as the reason to leave and I don't blame them.  All I want is stability and a routine but that's the people who attract me appear to always want the opposite.  I stopped trying now.  <e1> My ex continued talking to me almost every day, it was nice </e1>  because  <e2> I still felt like she needed me </e2> ,until a week or two ago when she told me she was seeing someone and quickly we drifted apart.  Now she barely ever picks up the phone or replies to my texts.  It's fine. It's strange because I don't want to be with her anymore, and I know it.  I feel calm, and content with the idea of taking my credit card, leaving to some exotic country, walking around for a day or two and then quietly end it somewhere where the people in my life wouldn't have to see me. 
Just	guys.	Just last week I posted on this subreddit.  I was in a fog and I got a little to close to comfort in ending this battle with depression once and for all.  But a few people spoke to me.  Although I was unable to reply much, or didn't have the tenacity to do so, the messages I received changed my perspective.  I'm still down and sad, but I'm not suicidal anymore.  So thank you.  I have a newfound hope because of you guys, and I couldn't be anymore greatful.  Also, I want any of you who are feeling suicidal or down to know that you can message me.  After realizing how strong the words of others can be in terms of stopping suicide, I wish to pass this experience onto others.  Again, thank you guys. 
Amazing	Mark	Amazing journey.  I did this by listening to others; being open to changing my belief system; living one heartbeat at a time; calling my sponsor daily; going to meetings; giving it my all for my family; meditation and prayer; going to AA meetings; loving myself more than the bottle; working the AA steps; fellowship with other sober people; being authentic; being vigilant about my daily routines and daily readings and doing what I'm told as opposed to what I want.  Peace to all of you here on SD it's make a remarkable difference to be a part of this group of people.  Mark
I'm	sucks.	I'm really struggling today with anxiety and fear and worry at work.   I have a meeting in 20 minutes that I am dreading.   I feel like I'm doing a terrible job at work.   I work from home and usually drink when I work.   I use it as fuel.   Now that I'm not drinking I can't seem to get much done, I have zero motivation, and I dread speaking with anyone.   I keep pacing around and feel like my heart is beating a mile a minute.   This really sucks.   If I drink then the anxiety will go down for a little while at least.   But I'd really like to get through this to the end of the day, take my licks as they come, without drinking if I can.   This sucks. 
A	advice?	A couple years ago I felt very depressed and had some struggles with eating and self harm.  I was very nervous to talk to my parents about speaking to a therapist (at that point I was still in High School), but eventually I did and I saw her for a short while before stopping and going off to school.  In the past month or so, however, I have felt myself start to slip back into that depressing mindset, and have began to slip back into old destructive habits.  I'm very nervous to speak to anybody about this.  I'm home from college for the Summer and I have pretty much no friends.  I want help asap but I'll be going back to school in a month or so and I feel like it will be a waste of money and time for my parents.  For some reason I keep thinking that if I just ignore it it will be fine but that's proving to be wrong and I have nobody to talk to.  Can anyone offer any advice? 
Whilst	empty?	Whilst generally over the last year I would say i have felt depressed 95% of the time, some days sare worse than others.  For me today is one of those days.  I feel like my soul is hiding.  (Melodramatic, but thats how I feel)What do you guys do to try and make the empty days not so empty?
one	bad	one friend tried helping me, shes a really great person and i know she knows exactly how i feel but i cant do shit.  im still in the same old pit constantly wishing to die all the fucking time.  and i know im a disappointment to her.  for fucks sake.  no, im a disappointment to everyone, but ive come to terms with that.  but i cant stand the feeling of being so to her, she already deals with a lot of shit and then im just there fucking useless piece of crying shit weighing down on her shoulders AND I CANT EVEN FUCKING CHANGE ANYTHING  i want to die so fucking bad
I	ADHD?	I ask simply because:One can observe that even people with ADHD have varying impairments with varying degrees of severity.  Further, some people with ADHD excel at certain tasks that others with or without ADHD experience difficulty.   &amp;nbsp;Is there a consistent difference that makes someone definitively ADHD versus non-ADHD.  Is there such a thing as borderline ADHD?
I have no idea what to write	I feel nobody would want to hire me and the application will sound ridiculous	It's my first job I have to search for and it just seems impossible.  I panic over the thought of having to go and personally hand them out (sending them is not an option because I feel like it gives me a better chance to get the job to go out and do it. . . ) and writing an application is even more frustrating and panic-inviting.  I deal with GAD and I'm really scared that when I hand them out I mess up or come off as awkward and I really do not like selling myself short and  <e1> I have no idea what to write </e1>  as  <e2> I feel nobody would want to hire me and the application will sound ridiculous </e2> .  It's seriously starting to tear me apart inside as I really need a job but I have no idea where to begin and my anxiety for everything about it just stops me.  I really want it so much but I don't know how to handle it.  Any advice or experiences would be so much appreciated.  Thank you. 
My hands are numb just typing, i can barely feel them and every time i touch my wrists i'm in agony	i've managed to bruise my bones	So usually when i get angry, i hurt myself in some other way e. g.  punching, cutting, scratching, hitting etc.  I have been clean from cutting for 117 days but i still punch/hit/scratch myself every time i'm angry or sad.  Anyone know how i can stop this?  <e1> My hands are numb just typing, i can barely feel them and every time i touch my wrists i'm in agony </e1>  because  <e2> i've managed to bruise my bones </e2> .  This is not how i wanna live my life. 
Yeah,	alive.	Yeah, so.  Basically stuck as I cannot explicity  say I am suicidal to the degree I am, as that would mean, either voluntary in - patient treatment *not gonna happen* or forced *not gonna happen* either as both scenarios are massively weaved into the PTSD I have from in patient treatment. I was raped several times by a member of staff.  I told another member of staff about it and she laughed.  I was degraded, humiliated, made fun of.  Physically, mentally &amp; emotionally abused. One option to get out even if I don't get out alive. 
I'm	anymore.	I'm deep in a slump right now and struggling to go on.  The entire summary of my life is that I am a waste of space slowly burning my wick until inevitable death.  Sometimes there are highs and lows but overall I have no feelings about my life a all, sometimes I am happy and other times existing itself is suffering, but I've gotten to the point where it just feels like nothing, everything is nothing, endless nothing that expands in both directions of time forever. There's no greater purpose, there's no end goal, there's no one who expects anything of me.  There are no rewards or big reveals at the end, there is no punishment either, there's no point to anything.  I just exist and waste air and food and money, I do the same thing every single day or I don't do the same thing, none of it makes any difference or matters.  I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I	happening?	I have been on Vyvanse (50mg) for the last 3 years and I have had episodes of high heart rate (115 bpm+) occurring right after eating meals and lasting up to 5 hours after regardless of meal size and frequency.  I also get a brain fog and feel extremely lethargic but can't fall asleep in this state.  I have found others on ADHD forums that have had the same symptoms but with no conclusion as to what is going on.  I had food allergy tests and liver enzymes, thyroid hormones, and other blood tests to rule out being sick.  How do you guys manage this symptom and any thoughts as to what is happening? 
My	hanging	My stomach feels like shit and I feel anxious.  Im going out for the first time today with a friend and I usually dont have this type of anxiety, im scared of it beung awkward anf screwing up.  We talk a lot and think a like and im a close friend but I have this fear ill fuck up and itll go bad.  I also have a fear of being planted (dont know if thats the right expression in english) left hanging
After	anymore.	After embarrassing myself (again) yesterday while having family over, I've decided to give up drinking for good.  I clearly have trouble with moderation and always end up being mean, loud, and obnoxious.   Not to mention the cost, empty calories, and being hung over the next day. . . it's just not worth it to me anymore.   
I'm	well	I'm lucky to have some amazing people that I can call close friends and this past week, when I was away at week long event with them, I explained to them exactly why I wasn't drinking.  Unfortunately, or actually maybe fortunately, it wasn't until a couple of days had passed and one asked me seriously awkward questions in front of several people why I wasn't drinking.  The next day I was still uneasy about the previous night's questions and eventually just was about to go off for a run (I've been running since April - I have an athlete friend who's raining me - just for health/fitness purposes) but the questioner caught me in the hall and we ended up having a really important talk.  She's a great person and admitted that she has considered rethinking her alcohol consumption as well
I'm	tired.	I'm not content with my body, I've never been. I got a lot of defects that can't be corrected. A fat person could go to the gym and lose weight. A person with crocked up teeth could go to the dentist and get their stuff fixed. But I'm balding, hair implants aren't effective and a wig would be too ridiculous.  Balding at a young age means your death. Average people doesn't want ugly people around them. The pool of girls you could interact with cuts down probably to 1% as if you weren't balding. I hate my body, my genetics.  We only have one life and I'm forced to live it with this body, which I don't like. I want to give up on everything, no point on living like this anymore. I hate looking at myself everyday in the mirror, I barely do it honestly anymore, I can't take pictures of myself, I hate who I am. I am too tired. 
I	hospital?	I have been feeling pretty terrible lately, to the point where I've decided to start going to therapy again.  I hate so many things about myself and I really just want to die sometimes.  I am terrible in social situations.  Once I start talking I cant stop and its embarrassing.  I say things without thinking and just ramble about nonsense.  I am also a lesbian and I really dont want to be even though if I came out of the closet everyone in my life would unconditionally support me.  I am hoping therapy works for these things (it didnt last time) I cant actually ever tell my therapist that I feel suicidal (right?) It is probably mandatory that I be brought to a hospital or something if its found out I am feeling this way.  I really just want to talk to someone about how I feel but I dont have any friends who i would feel comfortable talking about these things with.  All of my friends are really just acquaintances who I dont speak about serious mental disorders with.  What should I do when I feel like killing myself that wouldnt end with me in the hospital?
I	listen.	I know it's caused by a specific trigger (doctors offices).  I've tired going through all the potential horrible situations and talking myself down but my guts don't seem to listen to my brain.  I've also tried drugs (Imodium etc) and they work kind of but it's not a great thing to be constantly taking them every single time I have to go to an appointment.  I was hoping for some advice on how to de-escalate my anxiety when my guts wont listen. 
Been weedless for a week after what seems like a very long time of smoking day in, day out	I've found myself becoming increasingly irritable	 <e1> Been weedless for a week after what seems like a very long time of smoking day in, day out </e1> .   <e2> I've found myself becoming increasingly irritable </e2>  and honestly don't know how something I had once thought of as harmless is now causing some noticeable withdrawal symptoms.  I still love pot and feel like it's attributed to some good qualities of mine, but abusing it has just turned me into a goddamn vegetable.  I feel like I've learnt as much as I can from it and would like to drastically cut down my usage.  Haven't been exposed to it for a while but I'm afraid that when I do I might not be able to resist a toke.  As of now I'm trying a tolerance break for about a month, to see how sobriety feels like.  It's been kinda shitty so far.  
I feel used	I was there for her through so much, and now that she's improving, she doesn't want to be with me	My girlfriend of the past 3 years just left a sober home to live with roommates.  She and I shared a place when together.  She now wants to break up just as she is getting her life together.   <e1> I feel used </e1>  because  <e2> I was there for her through so much, and now that she's improving, she doesn't want to be with me </e2> . I don't really care to drink anymore (I never drank to a destructive degree) and would be far, far happier to have her in my life.  What is she going through? I want to appeal to save the relationship, but I don't know if she wants to get herself straight first, or what.  I want her to do what's best for her, but I also would be devastated to lose her. She doesn't appear interested in a break
I'm pregnant, which means I cannot take my meds and probably will not be taking them for a year after birth due to bfing	I am feeling so frustrated and overwhelmed recently	 <e1> I'm pregnant, which means I cannot take my meds and probably will not be taking them for a year after birth due to bfing </e1> .   <e2> I am feeling so frustrated and overwhelmed recently </e2> .  I just started my own in-home daycare and I feel like I am drowning under all the responsibility! I am managing but I can't help but remember how normal I felt while taking Adderal :(Is there ANYTHING, anything I can take that is safe for pregnancy? Thanks!
I'm	time]	I'm having a really difficult day for many reasons, and . . .  my roommate left for work leaving a bottle of wine on the kitchen counter.  I am really tempted, but I know that if I have a glass I'll just down the whole thing. I wish they would keep it in their room.  I guess I'll discuss it later, but I don't want to be unreasonable about it. [Edit: I know this isn't about weed, I'm just posting because I'm quitting both alcohol and weed at the same time]
I'm refusing to get help out of fear that medication will alter me.  It's redundant though	I've been self medicating with drugs and sometimes alcohol	I've been pretty depressed for the last two years, but it's really been recently that I want to hang myself and escape this miserable body.   <e1> I'm refusing to get help out of fear that medication will alter me.  It's redundant though </e1>  because  <e2> I've been self medicating with drugs and sometimes alcohol </e2> .  What hurts the worst is that I'm going down the same crappy path similar to my alcoholic father.  I'm so embarrassed that I dropped out of college because I couldn't stop getting high everyday.  Stuck in a shit job where you can be replaced tomorrow.  Surrounded by condescending co workers and some pretty arrogant people.  I moved out of my mom's last year, and it feels like they don't want me around.  Like I'm an impediment.  I'm nobody and I've accepted that. 
It's	tested?	It's been an up and down rollercoaster till now, constantly questioning whether or not I should get tested and telling myself I can do it if I just buckle down, but I finally went in to my college's counseling center and they helped me set up an appointment with a psychologist who my counselor really recommended. Right now though, I'm pretty scared.   What did you guys feel before getting tested?
I've	different.	I've taken it twice and it helps me feel somewhat calmer but I slept way too much and I don't feel rested.  I think it might be making my depression worse, too.  (I have both anxiety and depression, I was primarily interested in treating depression, but my psychiatrist didn't seem to take it seriously.  I'm getting a new one. )Edit: I'm gonna add that I was doubtful about it, but I've been waiting to get on medication for so long that I thought I might as well give it a shot. I don't want people to think it's inherently bad just because I don't like it either, I just think I should try something different. 
I know for a fact that it's definitely gotten worse this year	I've been under a lot of stress this whole time	I've been dealing with anxiety in some form for some time now (which I only realized with therapy), perhaps a few years, and it only ever feels like it's getting worse.    <e1> I know for a fact that it's definitely gotten worse this year </e1> , if only because  <e2> I've been under a lot of stress this whole time </e2> . I have been in therapy, but it never lessens the anxiety I have.   It seems to maintain myself at a certain level, though not always.   Whenever I go to a session, there tends to be focus on something that has happened recently, which sometimes helps for that, but in general my anxiety level still is pretty high. Just recently something happened that caused my anxiety to spike, and I was just feeling like I'm never going to have less anxiety.  :(  What can I do?Medication was suggested at one point by an older therapist, but right now I'm starting with a new therapist (due to appointment restrictions with the old one), and it hasn't come back up.   Plus, I'm kinda scared of the effects/side effects. Does it/can it get better?
It	happy.	It keeps getting worse and I can't anymore.  It's one thing after another, for 39 years.  I want it to be violent and terrifying in the end like my younger years were.  It's only a matter of time, now.  There's no stopping it, and that makes me insanely happy. 
So	relationships.	So I have recently been thinking that I may have SA.   Around a year and a half ago I attended an event for a hobby of mine.  I didn't know anyone but I tried to make conversation.  I remember feeling overwhelmed with nerves.  I remember I had quite a strong coffee before hand which might no of helped.  Anyway my hands started shaking and I caught people pointing and laughing.  I felt really embarrassed and I think its effected me.   I found that I will replay embarrassing or negative moments from my day over and over in my head, especially whilst trying to sleep.  It got so bad that the only way I could sleep was by smoking weed.  I realized after about 2 months that this isn't healthy and decided to stop, which is when I had a moment of clarity and thought this sounds like social anxiety.   I have this awkward throat clearing habit as well when I'm at work and have to talk and I've also noticed that my voice gets lower and my throat feels constricted.   I feel like it's effecting my overall mood and therefore my relationships.   
Dear	out.	Dear reddit,I know it may seem harsh that I'd call my mom a bitch, but if you knew her the way I did you'd feel the same way too.  She is the biggest bitch on the planet and I really wish I could tell her how I feel.  She only cares about her self and never bothers to ask how others feel.  She always talks negatively about all her kids and never fucking has anything good to say about them.  The sad thing is she talks negatively about everyone to her friends to, which really makes me feel more hurt.  Feel that way privately, but openly talking about your kids that way? Fuck you are words I'd love to say to you one day when you're alone and have no one to care for you, that'll be the day when you're dying in an empty room wondering where your kids are that'll be the day bitch you will regret everything. sorry, had to get that out. 
[Gatti	right?	[Gatti vs Ward I - Round 9]( youtube. com/watch?v=x2tPAhdsY34)His pure heart in the toughest of situations is so inspiring to me.  He could've stayed down on the ground from that agonizing liver shot, but he got up and kept going.  Anyone else would've given up in the midst of that round.  He had so many courageous fights before he was mysteriously murdered (probably set up by his loco wife). . .  anyway, just wanted to share. It may seem random and off topic, but this has been a really important part of my struggle with anxiety.  Anything that keeps your boat afloat, right?
I	here?	I had a manic episode that included a lot of psychosis and delusions.  I went into the hospital for a few days.  I took some strong meds while I was in there and I think I've finally slept them off.  But now I feel numb.  Where do I go from here?
Hi	classes	Hi anxious folks! I'm withdrawing off Lexapro for the third time and I was wondering how people managed to live life off meds.  Every time I try to get off, I always wind up right back on in a few months and I want to break that cycle.  Some details: The first time I went off was when I graduated college.  Thought Oh I'm not stressed about classes
(I'm	week.	(I'm 28, living alone)For a second month in a row, I usually have 2-3 beers a day.  I'm never over my limit, it just feels a bit sad to be sober.  Particularly sad to be getting older.  I never wanted anything stronger than a beer.  I enjoy the taste a lot - also it's incredibly hot where I live.  If I'm out of beer - I wouldn't be desperate to go to the shop.  If I didn't plan to get groceries, I wouldn't go just to get a bottle.  Should I be worried? Please be open about it.  Not sure if relevant, I cannot speak to my mother without having had a bottle or two - it just drives me mad.  When slightly drunk - I'm chilled and can ignore provocations.  She's not a bad person, just got too much of nervous energy.  I tried to be a good son, but can't handle it no more at this point.  She did a lot for me when I was little.  We don't speak often, maybe twice a week. 
[Me	day!	[Me 1 - Anxiety 0]( imgur. com/jzNIAbA. jpg?1)  I would like to share this today.   1 - I survived traffic this morning without getting anxious.   2 - No heart palpitations, shortness of breath, tremors, sweaty and shaking hands, blurry vision or dizziness!  3 - NO fear of being busy dying!  So I decided to count my blessings this morning instead before panic kicks in again.   Today I am thankful for:  1 - My wonderful and supportive SO   - My healthy and happy son  3 - Friends  4 - Having a job  5 - Having a home, food and clothes 6 - Being able to use all my senses.   7 - Having plenty of talents My goal today is to try and stay positive.  Here's me, wishing everyone a splendid day! 
But	victory.	But all I have today, and it has been great.   Today's Daily Reflection inspired every bit of this day.   May you all find peace.  :-) **A Priceless Gift** *By this time,in all probability we have gained some measure of release from our more devastating handicaps.   We enjoy moments of which there is something like real peace of mind.   To those of use who have hitherto known only excitement, depression, or anxiety-in other words, to all of us-this newfound peace is a priceless gift. * I am learning to let go and let God, to have a mind that is open and a heart that is willing to receive God's grace in all my affairs; in this way I can experience the peace and freedom that come as a result of surrender.   It has been proven that an act of surrender, originating in desperation and defeat, can grow into an ongoing act of faith, and that faith means freedom and victory. 
I pissed off a path in my side yard where no one could see me	because I was afraid of a stain in my bathroom and what it could be	I visited a therapist today 100 miles away who specializes in OCD.  I visited him because of an episode that happened 2 1/2 years ago.  To make a long story short, 2. 5 years ago, for 4 months,  <e1> I pissed off a path in my side yard where no one could see me </e1>   <e2> because I was afraid of a stain in my bathroom and what it could be </e2> .  When I had to sit down to go to the bathroom
I	compliments/reassurance?	I feel pretty constantly like I am at best a burden and at worst a girlfriend from hell to my SO.  I've come to depend on him in a lot of my anxious moments, but I need to get out of this reassurance-seeking cycle, and I can't.  Is there a better way to calm myself down, that doesn't involve fishing for compliments/reassurance?
you	this?	 you must be happy with yourself.  - Does anyone else disagree with this?
It's	outside.	It's so weird to me that other people have so many friends and so much going on in their lives.  I'm socially isolated and rarely leave my home.  When I do go out, I see so many groups and couples and conversations and it just reminds me of everything I've never experienced.  I just wish I was normal like every one else so I don't feel like such an outsider.  I don't really crave company, I just want to be like everyone else.  It feels like I'm going into another world when I go outside. 
I	.	I feel so useless, depressed and alone.   Maybe I need somebody to talk to. . . 
This is a great burden	even after going through one bout of anxiety, I know another will come (which of course, leaves me in a state of agitation for an extended time period)	 What I mean is that when I'm anxious over something, I usually get very anxious (or occasionally, an attack), about 4 separate times.  Specifically, the first is finding out I have to do the event, the second when I realize it's close (rather abstract and unpredictable), the third is when I wake up in the morning and/ or the night before, and the fourth is during.    <e1> This is a great burden </e1> , because  <e2> even after going through one bout of anxiety, I know another will come (which of course, leaves me in a state of agitation for an extended time period) </e2> .  Often times, if the event is social, or very important I will have an attack, with the third or fourth stage being the most common for attacks
I	month	I sound like a petty little child. . . I'm just so bitter and jealous seeing happy people living normal lies.  A friend offered to pay me ridiculously little for a job, I'm so broke this month
My work productivity, which was extremely poor to begin with, has become non-existent, and I'm forgetting more things than ever	as I'm so overwhelmed and distracted	Very long story short, I have been preliminarily diagnosed with ADHD-PI by my pcp, and am waiting to hear back from the psych to schedule an appointment.  I believe any appt won't be until September at the earliest.  I feel like I have begun recognizing my unhealthy coping mechanisms for what they are, and they're crumbling.   <e1> My work productivity, which was extremely poor to begin with, has become non-existent, and I'm forgetting more things than ever </e1> ,  <e2> as I'm so overwhelmed and distracted </e2> .  The thought of surviving another 30-45 days in this state before having a professional to talk to about it is almost too much.  Any advice on making it through?
I can handle it much better	since one year i also have a sever anxiety disorder which makes life even harder	Hello dp/dr, I had severe dp/dr for about 5 years now.   <e1> I can handle it much better </e1> ,  <e2> since one year i also have a sever anxiety disorder which makes life even harder </e2> .  I can cope with a lot of things and weird symptoms of dp/dr.  One thing what really makes my life hard is not being able to enjoy sex.  I do not have a girlfriend right now.  I still want to date girls and have one night stands but on the other hand i feel so depressed and numb while i have sex and especially after ( i ask myself:  did i just have sexxx???? ) So guys how do feel when you have sex?  How do think i can feel better?
I	hurt	I had it planned for me to kill myself after the Fall Out Boy concert tomorrow, but I don't want to wait anymore.   I've gathered pills from every where.  From cabinets, over the counter, my co worker.  I've been accumulating a pile for almost three weeks.  This has to work.  I am so afraid it will hurt
I	done	I have a bad habit of forgetting to fill my adderall xr before I run out sometimes and right now is one of those times.  I'm not really worried about it because I don't have anything I eed to get done just stuff I kinda want to get done
Now I have to worry about actually getting food poisoning	since I don't feel completely sick but feel anxious with a minor stomach ache	If it is food poisoning I will vow to never, never and I mean NEVER! eat fast food again.   <e1> Now I have to worry about actually getting food poisoning </e1>   <e2> since I don't feel completely sick but feel anxious with a minor stomach ache </e2> .  Also have to worry about eating anything that is not fully cooked for a couple weeks.  That's it I'm just going to eat foods that don't spoil or can give me food poisoning.  Fruits, I'll eat just fruits. 
It's	anxiety.	It's as if everything I do is weighed down by thoughts like I'm not smart enough or I don't have all the answers or I'm not good-looking enough.  I don't know how to simply get past all this comparing myself to others.  It's as if I don't want to be my own person, I just want to be a combination of everyone else's good qualities.  It's making others around me worried and I'm afraid of falling deeper into anxiety. 
This	genres.	This started to be a problem for me after two years in of playing guitar.  I learned how to play a lot of songs by ear and now if I listen to a song that has guitar I get distracted from what I was doing and start to think about how I would play it.   It doesn't help that I can't study well without listening to something through  headphones to block out other sounds.  I usually listen to rap or electronic now when I study but I wish I wasn't so easily distracted when listening to other genres. 
This	cry?	This is the second time somebody I've tried to make a friend has blatantly stopped responding when I message them.   The first time he wasn't too close and it was taken as passive aggressive.  When I saw him in person he'd known what he did and the animosity was tangible.   This time, though, it's somebody if known for years.  I opened up to himself than I have most.  When I talked to his friend he had his phone and spend the weekend with his friend.  Over a week to respond but he hadn't.  This man owes me money, on top of it all, a lot of it.  He was somebody I'd considered a friend.   How do to cope with such cold cut, unforgiving rejection? Repeated cases of avoidance and blatant signs that YOU AREN'T WANTED.  No sugar coating, saving face, or excuses.  You've been isolated as the problem.  You've tried and change, but it doesn't work.   What do I do other than cry? 
Been	bullshit.	Been depressed since as long as I can remember.  Sometimes I feel like I'm schizophrenic, but I don't know if that's worse than my reality.  I'll never share a real laugh with a friend, a real kiss with a lover, a real embrace even from my mother.  There's always the doubt.  I accept that.  It's part of my life.  If I was sure it would be the end, I'd kill myself in a heartbeat.  I have to die some time, right? Since I'm here I just want to run out the clock.  All I want is to come to peace with what I am.  I don't want to be strong, or smart, or drugged, I'm just tired of bullshit. 
I	YOU	I graduated last year and taught of getting  specialised in my field by attaining masters degree.   But since then I am just putting my plan off regularly thinking about some other reasons related to my family(which is not going to help me personally) . . . . I regret not moving forward but again I am kind of living low without excitement and pleasure  I was pushed forward by my classmates regarding project work and ve always restricted myself to average grades  I had few other plans as well but I just lose focus thinking this would be great or the other one is better. . . .  Problems like unable to make eye contact or unable to concentrate after few minutes have been over years but I ve noticed them now  My friends drive so swiftly but I am so much confused it takes triple the amount of time to make side reverse turn Having anxiety attacks since two odd years TL:Dr its been over year and half and I am unable to move forward in my professional life due to lack of goals anxiety  THANK YOU
Hey	ferry!	Hey everyone!  Just was wondering if anyone has any apps for android they could recommend for to-do lists? Been having a bit of trouble recently needing to do something and forgetting about it/not writing it down.  On a side note does anyone have any hints of tips on improving adherence to writing things down in a to-do list? Thanks! Sorry if this is slightly convoluted, currently hurrying from a train to not miss a ferry!
Hi	you!	Hi all.  Was diagnosed ADHD prior to entering law school and was prescribed Adderall 20 IR MG  and then Adderall 25 XR MG and suffered from severe anxiety going into my second year.  I added Lexapro 10 MG to counteract the anxiety and it seemed to help at the time, but my motivation was gone and I felt emotionally numb all the time.   I just finished the year and came off everything, my relationship and life seems to be falling apart.  I got back on Adderall 10 IR MG and although it seems to be helping a little bit, I'm lacking the aggression and presence I had.  I was alot more friendly and clicked more with my gf on the lexapro than anyone else and when I came off, we don't click but I click with everyone else.  Anyone else have these sort of struggles? I'm not sure if I'm bored with the reality of my life or depressed.  Thank you!
I've	.	I've undergone several med changes over the past few months to address a depressive episode.  At no time during this period did I have suicidal plans.  It's been more of the feeling that if I didn't wake up ever again, I wouldn't really mind.  Along with the uncontrollable crying, hopelessness, negative thoughts, isolating, and inability to function at work.  I'm now on four different medications (wellbutrin, lamictal, lexapro, and seroquel) and the dr.  is adding a fifth (lithium).  I got sick yesterday from the lithium &amp; was told to try taking it with a larger meal today.  How do you know when enough is enough as far as med changes? Maybe no drug combination is going to help.  Maybe I need to figure out a way to get by in life the way I am now (alternating between tearful and feeling flat).  Only, that wasn't working so well for me, which led to the med changes. . . 
Yea,	blind.	Yea, its an anxiety group for teenagers.  My therapist keeps telling me that everyone feels exactly the same about the group as I do but I still can't shake the feeling that I'm about to throw up everywhere.  Also, I cry in therapy.  Just regardless of what its about, if I'm talking about me personally I cry.  What if I cry in front of everyone and its awkward? Or what if everyone's already friends and I'm that one kid in the corner alone until it begins? Or what if we do ICE BREAKERS  What do I even expect going into this ugh I'm a nervous wreck right now :( a few days ago when I was going through a depressive/hyper anxious period I even considered taking a few shots before I came in just so I wouldn't be so freaked out (I won't actually, I just consider dumb things when I'm down).   Anyway, what the hell do I expect? I hate going into things blind.  
Hi!	experience?	Hi! I'm curious to see how other people have responded to topiramate.  I've taken it before but had to be taken off of it due to side effects.  The first trial ended in a suicide attempt.  The second, months after the first try, I was very agressive, violent and had a lot of homicidal ideation.  Which is completely out of character for me.  I'm a quiet, nonviolent, gentle borderline.  Well to other people, a completely different case when it's directed at myself.  In any case, I was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience?
I	Unfortunately	I have only just discovered this sub. . .  I've mostly been a reddit lurker but in recent weeks, I've really started to get overwhelmed by the ADHD and thought maybe this would be a good place for support.  My short summary - I'm 34/F - diagnosed with over-focused ADHD with OCD symptons.   I mostly worry about EVERYTHING.   I come up with every possible negative solution (despite rationality) for things and spend countless hours worrying about these absolutely absurd scenarios.   I've been out of work for nearly 8 months.   I was laid off and had a 6 month severance and thought I'd find a job long before the time ended.   Unfortunately
I	Fuck.	I finally decided to look into health insurance.  I knew open enrollment was closed, but I heard you could apply for medicaid year round.  That works, since I have no income at the moment.  So I go and fill out the application.  Get this back:  Based on the information you provided, the new federal health care law provides that you could be eligible for free or low cost health care through Medicaid.  However, the state of TX has chosen not to offer you this new health care coverage at this time.  . . .   So if I want to do something I literally have to wait until the new year.  Why is American healthcare like this? I heard Texas is bad with giving out medicaid anyway, but really?  Fuck. 
After	helped	After two months of relief, hate, frustration, joy, crying, anger and on and off depression; I've sort of just accepted it.  ADHD is a part of me, and my personality.  I have forgiven my self for never paying attention.   - For being easily frustrated.   - For being obnoxious.   - For being unfiltered.   - For crying easily.   - For always being late.   - For my anger.   - For never being prepared.   - For forgetting small things all the time.   - For doing stupid reckless stuff.   - For never Reading The Fucking Manual.   - For saying hurtful things to others.   - For abusing alcohol.   - For not being able the to just get a grip.   I have forgiven those who saw me struggle and never helped
I'm	:(	I'm so upset.   I care so much about animals, always have.   I can't shake this horrible feeling.   It makes me sick to my stomach and it's keeping me up tonight.   I just can't deal with knowing that I murdered an innocent animal.   I took its life.   I don't know what the animal was because it was dark and I couldn't see but it was cat sized.   I can't stop thinking that it was a cat and I murdered somebody's cat.   This is one of the worst feelings.   I've been through some shit but without going into detail, running over that animal really affected me.   I just think of how much I love my cat and how sad I would be if someone ran him over.   :(
I	threats	I got really worried and stressed 4 months ago about something ridiculous and I literally just snapped and I haven't been the same.  I started viewing everyone as threats
Hey	privately.	Hey all.  I'm in desperate need of a hand.  My friend admitted she has sex to take her depression away, and she won't listen.  She is constantly threatening her life if I approach her about it.  I'm running out of ideas.  Can anyone help?Edit: some information I am only willing to share privately. 
I wouldn't have to worry about anything for awhile, which I know is irrational	I would still have to deal with things and they would probably even build worse	I'm having a bad day and feel like seeing if anyone can relate to a particular feeling I get often.  I'm easily overwhelmed and I constantly want to be taken care of which makes me feel lazy, useless, guilty, and burdensome.  I often fantasize about getting injured or really sick, so that  <e1> I wouldn't have to worry about anything for awhile, which I know is irrational </e1> ,because  <e2> I would still have to deal with things and they would probably even build worse </e2> .   Anyway, just feeling particularly bad about it tonight because I've been house sitting alone and haven't felt like leaving the house, even though there was stuff I wanted to get done. 
I'm not really sure about a compromise	telling him to never get frustrated at me beating myself up is about as realistic as me just stop being sad or anxious	I know that dealing with my freakouts can be frustrating, and I know he's only human and cannot be patient with them 100% of the time. . .  but when I'm freaking out about something and he gets frustrated my brain mid-freakout takes it as what the hell is wrong with you why are you so stupid you're driving him away and it makes the freakouts and depressed moments more frequent. . .   <e1> I'm not really sure about a compromise </e1>  because  <e2> telling him to never get frustrated at me beating myself up is about as realistic as me just stop being sad or anxious </e2>  Any suggestions on how I can let him know how appreciated he is?
I have rhythm, but can't stay in that pocket	I get distracted and lose count	Are there many of us out there? The reason I ask is because a lot of my problems as a bassist seem to stem from my ADHD.   <e1> I have rhythm, but can't stay in that pocket </e1>  because either  <e2> I get distracted and lose count </e2> 
Now I'm very afraid to quit	what I may have been suppressing with weed for the last 20 months of daily smoking	I set a quit date for my birthday (yesterday) about a month ago.  I have the typical story on this thread: letting weed take over my life, smoking to function normally, letting relationships burn away, etc.  I ran out of weed about a week ago and told myself I wouldn't smoke again until my birthday, which would be my last day.  I held to that and I smoked a few bowls yesterday and haven't smoked today.  But this was easily the most depressed day I've had in years.  I have always dealt with depression and I think I'm just now realizing the real reason I smoked is to deal with it.   <e1> Now I'm very afraid to quit </e1> .  because of  <e2> what I may have been suppressing with weed for the last 20 months of daily smoking </e2> .  Has anybody gone through something like this? Any advice?
So	JustBPDthings	So I was in a short, intense relationship a couple of months ago with a girl who claimed to be a lesbian but left me for a dude.  I was devestated.  I loved her and wanted to be with her FOREVER.  She left the state to be with him.  I kept in touch with her bestfriend to kind of keep tabs on her.  Through her friend I learned that she was unhappy with this dude and might possibly come back.  I was excited at the possibility of a second chance with her.  Well, I was watching the friend's kid and me being nosey and a schemer, I went through the friend's mail.  Finding out friend's last name, I looked her up on Facebook, then went through her friends to find my ex.  I was unable to cyber stalk her previously because I never knew her full name.  I find out she's engaged!? Wat.  I am crushed.  But she also says where she works and what city she lives in on her Facbook.  It's not far, maybe a 100 miles.  Thinking of taking a trip lol.  # JustBPDthings
I find the last one quite suspicious	as half the information leaflet of that one reads  o tests conducted and no reliable literature	It went pretty smooth.  Well, except the part when I was informed that it's required to have a family member or relative present to see a doc and had to wait half an hour for my mom to arrive.  (I wonder if this is strictly a China thing, or because I went to a specialized psychiatric clinic?) The doctor was quite understanding too, even asked me if a blood test would be okay since it's pretty natural for someone obsessed with contamination to be afraid of that.  Got prescribed Paxil, Sediel and some weird mix of Piracetam/Cerebrolysin/Chondroitin sulfate plus a whole bunch of vitamins and stuff.  Anything I should know taking these?  <e1> I find the last one quite suspicious </e1>   <e2> as half the information leaflet of that one reads  o tests conducted and no reliable literature </e2> . . .  probably want to discuss with the doc next week if it's really necessary since I get obsessed with losing track of my meds and the more there are the worse it gets
So	sad	So we decide So we side So I decide  Suicide I'm so sorry So sorry I can't even explain All the things thoughts and  No thought for even a blame  Not you not then not even him I don't really know why  It's just not really just one thing  I love you I do  And I'm so incredibly sorry  I know of the things We still would love to do But I'm empty and done There's nothing really more left  I'm no real fun There's just nothing more left  Please forgive me It's not your fault  I'm just kind of lost But I know you've always fought  I love you Please don't be sad 
I'm	better?	I'm just now realizing how I completely destroyed a 2 year relationship, that was almost entirely characterized by me wearing down a wonderful person and really darkly affecting them for so long.  It's really scary to realize how differently I was perceiving my reality, even though I know help is finally on the horizon.  Does it ever get less scary to deal with, and does my control of this thing have a chance at getting better?
I'm	shit.	I'm still not certain whether it would have been free anyways or only through the SumoApp promotion, but I signed up anyways:* The SumoApp page:  appsumo. com/workflowy/* Just going there directly:  com/An over 50% probability, I don't end up using it, but the whole *idea* of using something like that certainly appeals to me.  Right now, it's a blank page.  I didn't even know until I started searching for others that there was a wiki category called 'DESKTOP OUTLINERS':*  wikipedia. org/wiki/OutlinerI don't want anything that requires me to download software or clog my phone with apps.  I know it's not an outliner but right now Google Calendar saves my ass from forgetting to do shit.  
I feel cancerous, and I don't know what to do other than avoid everyone, in fear that I will destroy all my positive relationships	I can't control - or sometimes notice! - my emotions	Like a lot of ADHDers, I have problems regulating my emotions.  My feelings have always felt justified, for the most part, in the moment.  But a recent outburst at work (angry texts to my boss. . . WHYYYYYYYY) has me feeling overwhelmingly guilty, humiliated and just so damn depressed.  I just want to lock myself in my room.  This seems to be a common vicious cycle: Overreacting to something innocuous (or sometimes not so innocuous), before processing my emotions; outside perspective shows I was in the wrong; I may fight it and argue, but deep down I know I fucked up; I can't stop obsessing over the fuckup, feeling like I ruined everything and everyone things I'm an idiot. And I just can't seem to stop kicking myself.   <e1> I feel cancerous, and I don't know what to do other than avoid everyone, in fear that I will destroy all my positive relationships </e1>  because  <e2> I can't control - or sometimes notice! - my emotions </e2> .  Does anyone else have these experiences? How do you cope?
After	this.	After years of struggling for having ADHD, anxiety and depression, most of the time.  I just ask myself why I can't be normal and no matter how much I tried everyday with treatment, exercise , good nutrition, meditation and every single way to avoid anxiety, impulsiveness, feeling sad I just can't and I wonder if we are just like that, that's our nature that's how we meant to be? And maybe is the society that requires from us to be what we are not so we can fit in? Is possible that if we can be in a community were all of us have ADHD and or anxiety and or depression, we will be fine, would we put on ourselves impossible standards or would we just live with our characteristics or symptoms as the normal way to be?Note 1: sorry for my English I am not native English speaker. Note 2: this is a question, a real concern I have and not an affirmation, I just like real arguments and real opinions from those whom like me know about this. 
Hi	highly	Hi I want to kill myself, I don't post on this site or use it much .  I turned 17 recently and got my higher(A levels) results back , and upon reading I know I have officially fucked it.  I got 2 B's in higher English and Music and a D in higher biology, I tried really hard to get good grades and I fooled myself into thinking I would get three A's .  What's more cocked up is that I had the opportunity to get 5 grades instead of just 3 , I was just not bright enough to do higher maths and I crashed higher drama .  What makes me sad is that I genuinely did exceptionaly well in my practical performance of the crucible (worth 60% if the grade) even though I was told a couple month's prior my acting was ot higher standard by my own guidance teacher .  I remember the invidulator saying that day how she would mark everyone highly 
I	before?	I don't know why, but during running I feel normal.  But right after I crash and start to feel depressed and anxious again. Have you guys felt this way before?
I've	here	I've been depressed for as long as I can remember.   My family is rife with mental health issues, and I suppose I inherited, at least.  a predisposition.   Of course, growing up in a household with parents who hadn't wrangled their own demons wasn't exactly healthy for a kid.   Regardless, looking back, even my earliest memories are tainted with grief.   I've let it develop me into a pretty shitty adult. I could ramble about what lead to it here
Meh.	improved	Meh.  Been suicidal for a long time now.  Always put it off as I thought stuff would improve in the future. But I have now realized that it is all not worth the effort.  Sure, my life could improve if I put in the effort, but I am so far away.  I am too tired, and I don't have the willpower or resolve to make any effort.  The only thing that scares me about death is what if I didn't die my life improved
I	this?	I have this problem where noises people and things make drive me nuts.  it's starts of annoying and then it gets me extremely angry.   It's mostly people though.  From the noises they make while eating (including chewing and the sound of the utensils hitting the plate) to sniffling, coughing, sneezing, throat clearing, breathing loudly, nail clipping, humming tunes and the list goes on and on.  It gets to a point where I feel like they are doing it intentionally to annoy me.  Sometimes I think I would be happier if I was deaf or hard of hearing.  I consciously try to keep my self from getting annoyed when I hear things the bother me but I just can't seem to put the noises in the background.  Is there anything thing I can do to control this? 
I'm	emotions?	I'm using a throw away account for my own reasons. I have been getting irrationally angry since middle school.  Lately, it has been towards everyone, family, friends, strangers, and loved ones.  I get angry at almost anything and once it happens, it doesn't stop until it resolves.  It can be very taxing and I will often times punch and throw things.  I used to smoke weed everyday.  It helped with my depression, anxiety, bad self image, and it would overall help me to suppress my anger.  Is that healthy? It got rid of everything that would start my anger, but I have recently been forced to stop.  The anger has come back and it gets worse.  It is becoming more frequent and harder to stop.  I'm yelling and throwing things.  Was that healthy to use Marijuana to suppress it? Also, are there anything else I can use to stop these emotions?
I have a very hard time trying new things, which is hard for me	I am currently on a 4 month holiday	I suffered from severe depression as a teenager and while I am no longer depressed I have since developed anxiety over the last few years (24F).  I do all the usuals, cancel things at the last minute (usually I break down and cry and beg my partner to not make me go somewhere).   <e1> I have a very hard time trying new things, which is hard for me </e1>  because  <e2> I am currently on a 4 month holiday </e2> .  Right now I am in New Zealand snowboarding.  Except, I am sitting inside the cafe because I'm terrified to go out (and while I am a beginner, I can do the basics, and I've been maybe 5+ times).  I have just found this sub and have yet to really try and cure my anxiety.  I am scared to buy a self help book or tell anyone I want to meditate as I am scared of their judgement. So my question is, do you ever tell people about your anxiety as an excuse or explanation for your behaviour?
The first two weeks felt like Hell	I decided to quit smoking at the most stressful time at my job	 <e1> The first two weeks felt like Hell </e1>  because  <e2> I decided to quit smoking at the most stressful time at my job </e2>  but I made it through.  I am proud that I made it this far.  Just felt like sharing how close I've gotten.  
It is to the point, where I wake up in the middle of the night from weird anxiety dreams like getting served summons from my ex boyfriend to appear in relationship court	I still don't want to be friends or talk to him	One of my biggest things with my anxiety, is if I start to get a lot on my plate, I start to avoid every thing.  Responsibilities, people, activities.  Basically everything that isn't sitting on the couch watching tv.  I start to get a racing heart checking Facebook.   <e1> It is to the point, where I wake up in the middle of the night from weird anxiety dreams like getting served summons from my ex boyfriend to appear in relationship court </e1> ,because   <e2> I still don't want to be friends or talk to him </e2> .  I know I can get rid of a lot of the things that are causing this spike, but I freeze up when I start to do anything.  The fact that I cleaned my mess in the kitchen when my sister (also roommate) asked was a fucking miracle.  I feel a vibrating in my limbs when I think about how much I am making things worse, then the inevitable vice on the heart feeling, so I bury my head deeper, avoid more, and let the vicious circle continue.  
My	family.	My dad had asked me to go and drive him somewhere to get his car fixed, but I would be playing games I guess.  He shouted at me about and I knew I deserved every moment of it.  I can't even go as far as to open willingly help my own family. 
I'm depressed	loneliness	Everyone mentions its the way to go, but I don't really understand how to do it.    <e1> I'm depressed </e1>  mainly due to  <e2> loneliness </e2> : hardly any friends, never get invited to things, and no relationships.  Internally I feel like those are the only things that make me happy (friends inviting me, girls interested in me).  That being said:What tips do you have to help find inner peace and love? I've heard responses like you just have to start doing it.  I have tried but I still don't look forward to just hanging with myself all day, especially when friends post happy pictures with a group of people on social media. 
I unsubscribed from this sub for a while	I was starting to get a handle on my depression	You'd think I would've learned by now.   <e1> I unsubscribed from this sub for a while </e1>  because  <e2> I was starting to get a handle on my depression </e2> . . .   but here I am right back because I forgot the cardinal rule of depression.   If you try to beat it, it will punish you. I wake up every day and hope and pray that this is the day that a car goes over the line and takes me out.   I've finally resolved to locking myself in my house and not leaving anymore.   There's no point in anything anymore.   I've lost all hope for ever being happy again. No obligations to vote or reply or anything, I just needed to rant somewhere and this is the only place I can do that without feeling like I'm pushing my problems onto someone else. 
Absolutely	now.	Absolutely anything. Certain books, activities, anything. I'm totally desperate right now. 
Lately I've been having a lot of trouble falling asleep	I'm afraid of losing consciousness	[warning: potentially anxiety-inducing thoughts ahead]  <e1> Lately I've been having a lot of trouble falling asleep </e1>  because  <e2> I'm afraid of losing consciousness </e2>  and my body reawakening with a new consciousness.  In essence, Im afraid sleep is like dying.  Compounding this, my girlfriend and I, who have been together for many years, are still not living together - just occasional sleepovers - and I find that I face that fear much worse when she's not there. 
This	notes.	This hasn't really been a thing for me up until recently but it's been getting under my skin and I was just curious if anyone can relate to this.  So yesterday I was working on a course I've been doing for a long while now and the particular section of work that I was having trouble with finally 'clicked' and I was completing / understanding it no problem.  Today rolls around and I continue where I left off and fall flat on my face.  Things I had written yesterday just don't make any sense today and I had to basically backtrack and re-learn everything from yesterday.  This happens much too often and it's really frustrating, I'm just curious if anyone else goes through this and can provide any sort of tips to retain this information? I've even tried writing notes. 
I'm	.	I'm 25, male, and I've always been high strung.  But lately, like in the last week, I've just been pissed off and I can't find a reason for it. In the past I've had issues letting go.  Like if someone pisses me off in any way it's hard for me to get over it.  It sticks in my head.  Over a few hours it has always subsided.  But in the last week I've just been in a terrible shitty angry mood and its starting to interfere with life.  I don't even know why I'm pissed off anymore.  I just am an can't shake it.  I wake up in a bad mood and go to bed worse. Any suggestions? I might hire a Psychiatrist but I don't think I can afford one. . . 
I	skills.	I have some social anxiety issues.   I probably do better than most people that have it.   The only time I get anxious is if I have to talk to people I don't really know or talk to a semi large group. I have noticed that sometimes I talk slow when speaking to people.   Sometimes I'm focusing on what to say and what the other person/people will think of me while I'm talking.   I also have noticed that there is a general lack of body language. I didn't know if discussing these issue with a therapist would be beneficial or not.   I wasn't sure if maybe I needed to just put myself in more social situations to develop those skills. 
In	easily.	In a couple weeks I'm going to go take my permit test for driving and I was wondering if ADHD (I think I have it) will affect driving in anyway cause I can get distracted and stare into space very easily. 
Today	be/G74vJ2etQYk	Today I stumbled upon the Easy Way to Stop Smoking movie on youtube and just now I finished watching it! I feel like a new person! I don't want to smoke anymore and I'm certain I won't! Everyone can find that it's easy to stop smoking just by watching this movie in one sitting without any distractions.  I just wanted to share with everyone this wonderful cure.  It will cure you only in one hour! Afterwards you'll be an extremely happy non smoker again! So. . .  here's the link: be/G74vJ2etQYk
I end up wasting away entire days	I don't want to go outside or talk to people	I have to go to an office to deliver my resume to them.  This could potentially be a good oppertunity for me, but I am really afraid right now of going down there and talking to them in person.  I have been sitting down, doing nothing for about 4 hours now.  I've read this could be a symptom of depression or social anxiety, however I don't know how thin the line is from this and just general laziness.  This happens to me quite a lot, and  <e1> I end up wasting away entire days </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want to go outside or talk to people </e2> .  I end up sitting quietly in a room without eating or drinking anything. 
For	However	For over six months now, I've been suffering from near uncontrollable anxiety.  It seems like whenever something good happens to me, my mind will do everything in its power to make me afraid and turn it bad.  My bf, who has been supportive over the past few months, is becoming irritated with me and recently threatened to break up with me if I don't stop.  I've told him repeatedly that I have little to no control over it, but he dismisses them as excuses and tells me to get over it.  However
I'm a student and hate my life and have for a while but i haven't gone to the college therapy service	i think they will tag me as someone who is irresponsible and it will affect my job prospects	 <e1> I'm a student and hate my life and have for a while but i haven't gone to the college therapy service </e1>  because  <e2> i think they will tag me as someone who is irresponsible and it will affect my job prospects </e2> .  Who can they tell about what is said in hypothetical talk sessions? Also: i totally distrust physicians but am trying to get over it; I've been down for so long i need to know there is help out there even if it's only someone who's paid to make me feel better. 
Alright	funk.	Alright I have 3 boys, a wife, a messy house and am super overwhelmed today.  Looking for some insight or some inspiration to do more than just survive.  This week I am taking care of the kids while I wait to start a new job.  My wife has a busy week at work and I am feeling pretty useless at home.  Cant take good care of the kids and maintain the house.  Did I mention we have a broken dirty car that has been sitting at my wife's work for a week.  Embarrassing to me though she doesn't care about the car.  Ugh.  Just feeling whinny and don't see a way out of the funk. 
I've	together.	I've been extremely anxious, lonely and depressed lately.  You all have been a wonderful help from time to time so could we all just have a thread where we could unload our shit? I know this happens in individual posts but let's do this together. 
I danced around it	in my experience people get really defensive if they are confronted about being an alcoholic	Hello, first off this isn't for me but a buddy.  Today a friend of mine broke down.  And it all sounded very familiar because my brother is in the program.  I grew up watching his struggle with alcohol and substance abuse.  I've also watched him have success with his on again off again relationship with AA (mostly on these days).  Anyway i let my friend talk and he cant just be happy alone.  And with out getting to in depth it all came down to him needing an escape from him self.   <e1> I danced around it </e1>  because  <e2> in my experience people get really defensive if they are confronted about being an alcoholic </e2> .  But ultimately i suggested AA And it took a while and a few bro tears but he was really receptive.  I told him i would go with him, sit out side if need be.  I told him I would find a meeting and we could go together.  I really just want him to get through the door even if he has to lean on me to get there.  But after looking into it.  Their are all these different meeting types.  Like open
the emotional damage put a strain on us and a few weeks later I ended the relationship	I learned this wasnt the first or second time she's tried	So me and my ex of 2 years were happy we were engaged and trying to save for an apartment.  One night before work I was playing a game and she was in the bedroom.  She texts me saying good bye and I come in to find she had swallowed all her anti depressant medications.  Thankfully we got an ambulance and no permanent physical damage but  <e1> the emotional damage put a strain on us and a few weeks later I ended the relationship </e1>  because  <e2> I learned this wasnt the first or second time she's tried </e2> .  I felt that if she tried something like this then how could she really love me or know if she would do it again.  Now I just feel lost and don't know how to feel about her or the situation.  
This	course.	This probably happens 75% of the time- when I am doing something on the computer that is focus/thinking-intensive (such as applying for jobs, essay writing, playing games) I will get an increased feeling of nervousness.   Usually I am able to calm myself and surpress it to SOME degree, but it is still there.   It has nothing to do with the task itself, just the feeling I get from staring at a computer and having to think and focus.   I actually get a feeling of pressure in my eyes/face area and I have to make a squinting expression while I stare at the screen- sort of like a tick I guess?  I also grind my front teeth.   There is just this feeling of pressure that needs to be relieved but never does.   Sometimes I am able to catch the feeling quick and try to calm myself down, but then the nervous feeling just creeps back up 5 minutes later.   For the record, my vision is pretty good- slight astigmatism but nothing I need to have glasses on for.   I also have generalized anxiety of course. 
And I'm getting more sleep	I'm so fucking bored	It's been over a week now, I'm doing great.  There's some benefits in that my decision making is faster and I'm more capable in social situations - but I suspect these are symptoms of me getting more sleep than anything else.   <e1> And I'm getting more sleep </e1>  because. . .  <e2> I'm so fucking bored </e2> .  Getting high always helped me enjoy the downtime and, without it, I'm just bored at night. It's making me have second thoughts.  I really enjoyed smoking a doob at night and playing some games, that 'total switch off' was fantastic and I'm not getting that any more.  Do I go push myself towards moderation, or stay on the straight and narrow?
Hey	anything?Thanks!	Hey there!Until I am able to find a FT job in my profession, I am working at a bar.  This bar allows smokers, and the majority of patrons do smoke.  Last night we were incredibly slow (for example, a whole three people at one point. ) THAT'S when the urges hit.  I was so bored I didn't know what else to do with myself! The entire cleaning (and extra cleaning) list was already completed.   So, what do you all do when you're at work, it's boring, and you have the freedom to just kill time doing anything?Thanks!
I	shared.	I have just finished reading the book.  (Well, I listened to the audio book as I went about my day) First of all, I wanted to say that the book was very well done and that I would recommend it to anyone seeking support to kill the addiction.  I've been smoking for about 10 years.  Over this time I've tried to escape numerous times for family, friends and significant others but I've always felt as if I've been giving up a part of my life.  Over the past few weeks I've been lurking on this sub and I have been overwhelmed by the stories and support that users have shared.  
Hacking	co-quitters.	Hacking up brown slimy stuff has been a good motivator to me this last week or so.  For almost a decade I've been cramming that tar deep in my body, gross but happy to getting it out.  Figured out the other day that I took almost 1. 5 million puffs before I quit now.  That's a lot of breaths of sticky smoke.  I know it will be a while before my body recovers totally.  Well, almost.  Permanent damage has been done I suppose.  Breathe fresh my co-quitters. 
I	delusion.	I have a delusion that has been pretty prominent throughout my life, and tormented me mostly.  But ever since I've been talking about it with a supportive friend, I'm starting to appreciate or even like it sometimes? I was wondering how many of y'all are comfortable accepting/liking your delusions and how to stop feeling guilty for often enjoying this certain type of delusion.  
I'm	me.	I'm a 23 year old female and have always been a bit shy.  Recently, things are becoming more difficult for me.  I always have low self-esteem and I'm always worried about what other people think about me. No matter what club or job I joined, I always have a feeling that I don't belong there, and that the people there are enduring me.  
I do have problems falling asleep	my thoughts race when I lay down at night, but I've found using audiobooks to distract me allows me to fall asleep in 10 minutes instead of an hour. A few weeks ago, though, something changed	Tl;dr:  Got stressed about missing seizure meds, few weeks later had chest and arm pain that ended me in the ER three times, and last night I could stop crying.   Am I now an anxious person?  If so, what do I do?I've never thought of myself as an anxious person.   <e1> I do have problems falling asleep </e1>  because   <e2> my thoughts race when I lay down at night, but I've found using audiobooks to distract me allows me to fall asleep in 10 minutes instead of an hour. A few weeks ago, though, something changed </e2> .   For reasons I won't get into here, I found myself without my seizure medication for 24 hours.  I haven't had a seizure in 10 years and when I started feeling what I thought were pre-seizure feelings - as I described in [this thread]( reddit. com/r/Epilepsy/comments/3grhi0/missed_a_few_doses_of_dilantin_how_long_until/) in /r/epilepsy, I did get scared.   Having a seizure is an awful thing; I don't ever want to do it again. However, after I started taking my medication, the weird waves that washed over me didn't stop immediately as they usually do if I've forgotten to take my medication.   Throughout the next few weeks
It	better!	It was early in the morning and no one was home so I decided that this would be the day I do it.  I grabbed some rope out of the garage, found out how to tie a noose and got the whole setup completed.  I get up to make sure i was all set.  I then kicked the table over but the rope snapped at the middle and I fell flat on my ass.  I was silent for a second but then I started laughing uncontrollably.  It was the greatest laugh I've had in years. EDIT: Wow guys thanks for all the kind responses! Makes me feel a bit better!
I've	themselves?	I've been suicidally depressed most of my life.  I'm 33 now.  Earlier this year I was hospitalized four times until I finally received a round of ECT.  The treatment helped dramatically and I was better for about 4-6 weeks.  Now I'm suicidal again.  My pdoc recommended maintenance sessions but I'm hesitant.  The memory side effects are real.  I don't know if I can handle ECT that often.  I could really use someone to talk to about this.  Hopefully someone who's had maintenance ECT themselves?
I'm 99% sure the reason I'm freaking out so much	I got fired from my last job at a pizza place for taking a sick day	I started this job about 3 months ago and it literally could not be going any better.  My supervisors and managers all gave the owners great reviews about me and I already got a raise.  I woke up two hours late today and I would be at least an hour or two late to work so I decided to take a sick day.  As soon as I sent the email, I started having an anxiety attack thinking I'm going to get fired or they think I'm a wimp (I work construction) and my mind is just racing.   <e1> I'm 99% sure the reason I'm freaking out so much </e1>  is because  <e2> I got fired from my last job at a pizza place for taking a sick day </e2> .  I had bronchitis and got a doctor's note but they fired me anyway. Anyway, I'm 19 and in a great union so I know my job is safe but I can't knock this feeling.  I'm glad I typed that all out, I needed to share with somebody. 
I'm	kids.	I'm not afraid of the meeting.  A friend in recovery is taking me and I know I have the love and support of her and my family.   What scares me is how much I have to lose with my family by being honest with them as I progress.   I'd love to hear stories of spouses and families sticking by through thick and thin during recovery.   My fearful mind worries my wife could leave and take the kids.   
So	can.	So I made it. One full year without touching a single goddamn drop of poison.  So today, I'm going to allow myself to unabashedly feel pretty damn proud of myself.  I will celebrate with a pint of Ben and Jerry's.  I will call my friends and meet up for lunch.  I will do any number of things I couldn't/wouldn't do when I was passed out at the bottom of a bottle.  But most importantly, I will post here and thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for supporting me when I needed it and for slapping some sense into me when I needed that even more. So again, thank you all. And to everyone starting out (cliche alert!!!), hang in there.  You can do this. Really. You can.  
Is	me	Is it possible for someone with(or even without) cronic anxiety/stress to be completely shocked and over run when finding out something about someone you know well? Someone I work with was arrested  and charged with some serious allegations.  The employer is suspending him from work without pay until it's gone through court.  Since learning about it 24 hours ago i was in a mode where i felt Holyshit as if it was acute stress disorder.  This isn't something which affects me
I	computer	I woke up at 10 o clock today and I've done nothing but reddit since.  I've had nothing to eat or drink, I pissed once in a water bottle, been smoking a lot of weed, and have just been posting like crazy to reddit.  I can't stop and it's ruining my life.  I haven't turned in an assignment from work and it's 3 days late now and I just keep letting it slide.  I don't know how to put down the computer
I have no motivation, depression takes its toll.  I have had to constantly get fillings, root canals	smoking	I am a younger man, almost 21.   <e1> I have no motivation, depression takes its toll.  I have had to constantly get fillings, root canals </e1>  because of  <e2> smoking  </e2> (used to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day).  I became less energetic, more socially awkward and scared of just social interaction.  I work out 5/7 days of the week.  I am about to have to have another couple of hundreds dollars worth of dental work done.  I just need some help, something to follow to get over the hold of marijuana. (Lives in the US)
So	do??	So basically worrying about the possibly-debilitating effect of the antibiotic Macrobid has ruined my birthday.  Big surprise.  It's been this way for nearly a month, why would it end now?I can't tell if the perceived numbness and weakness in my left arm is purely a symptom of anxiety or my body wasting away from the toxic neurologic effects of that medicine.  I've been the the ER but that was a little while ago and this wasn't present then.  It's getting worse along with my anxiety, which rules every waking instant of my life now. Worried about ending up in a wheelchair or physically numb and distant forever from this.  The very thought is eating me alive.  Oh, and I've got another UTI which needs to be treated sometime today.  Got amoxicillin for a tooth infection and I thought you could take that for a UTI as well. . . ? So worried about creating antibiotic superbugs, being on them so much. What a horrible birthday.  I've tried and tried to get over it but I can't.  What can I even do?? 
My	again.	My boyfriend is in the midst of a bad episode for a few days.  I have done everything I can as to not overwhelm him.  He just keeps talking about self hate and how is is a loser and worthless(which he is not) he said he is better off dead and might as well kill himself and it scares me.  I don't think he would, but I know his thoughts are obsessive.  He quit taking all meds about a month ago.  Should I make him go to a psychiatrist? I don't know what else to do.  He is open to taking meds again. 
I can't really do more than 20mg in a day	the come downs are rough	**Edit: just found this article. . . apparently I'm not alone in this problem!  com/the-average-worker-is-only-productive-for-3-hours-a-day/**Title says it all.  This only really holds true for my desk job.  If I do work in the morning, I'm useless after lunch.  And visa versa- if I do nothing all morning, if by some miracle I get back on the ball after lunch, it's only for 2-3 hours. Part of this might be my adderall wearing off, but  <e1> I can't really do more than 20mg in a day </e1>  because  <e2> the come downs are rough </e2> .  Sometimes one 10mg pill twice a day can do the trick. . . other times when I take a 10mg I don't feel it at all. I'm happy when I'm productive and working hard.  I'm miserable and cranky when I'm procrastinating.  You'd think it would be easier to just do what makes me happier. . . -_-
my Dr says I have adhd and has prescribed me medicine	I'm only asking	 <e2> I'm only asking </e2>  because  <e1> my Dr says I have adhd and has prescribed me medicine </e1> , but I don't see the need.  Also, as I'm depressed and anxious I would prefer answers pertaining to issues that are not adhd comorbities.  Thanks in advance
I know I look weird now.  I know when this has happened before, people get mad at me for this	they think I hate them for not saying anything	Does anyone else feel too tired to talk sometimes? Right now, I'm at my company bbq, running on 5 hours sleep and feel like crying because I'm just too tired to talk to anyone.   <e1> I know I look weird now.  I know when this has happened before, people get mad at me for this </e1>  because, <e2> they think I hate them for not saying anything </e2> . I don't hate them.  I'm just exhausted and confused as to what to say.  
So	this?	So I have been dealing with what I think is anxiety for quite some time now.  About twice a week it flares up, and I get extremely anxious.  Those suck, but at least I understand what's going on, to some extent.  What's worse is the day to day feeling.  My mind is in fear of things that I don't seem to fully understand so I end up wandering around, not being able to focus, or finish a single train of thought, no matter how simple the thought.  It's like I've growth fearful of thinking, and my unconscious mind is preventing me from doing so.  Has anyone else felt like this?
I am a man who cannot have fun, laugh, or look at other men	i always feel anxious and nervous	Help!!! Therapists of Reddit!!!  <e1> I am a man who cannot have fun, laugh, or look at other men </e1>  because  <e2> i always feel anxious and nervous </e2> .  But around women I am a social butterfly and I always have a great time with them.  How can i change my habits of awkwardness and socialize with the other half of the gender spectrum?
Title	title.	Title says most of it really, noticed that pretty much everyone elses dosage that I see is quite a bit less, even for the extended release, just wondering if it's all fine?Peoples experiences with similar dosages?Additional possibly useful information:* Diagnosed ADHD-I (ADD?) about a month ago* Been on Methylphenidate Hydrochloride (Tranquilyn) 20mg twice a day for a month* In the UK so drug options are limited, and changing my prescription is a hassle, but neither I nor my Psych wouldn't be against itSuffered on/off from: * Random nosebleeds (never had it before) * Light headedness (had it before)* Overheating* Heart freaking out/overworking * Dulled consciousness  * Light sensitivity  * Irritability  * Euphoria * Similar crashes to what I assume a MDMA/Cocaine come down is like where I have literally no energy, focus for about a day, happens 1-2 times a week TL;DR: The title. 
I	in?	I was always known to be the super mellow guy that goes with the flow of everything.   It's one aspect my wife loved in me.   Since having a child I find myself getting angry and snapping quickly.   Not just things that involve my daughter, to everything.   I can feel myself quickly getting to that point of destructive anger and then nothing else around me matters.   I hate myself for that especially when i'm driving.   If someone is turning left where they shouldn't be I get aggressive.   Then I think 2 seconds later why did  I do that. . . it delayed me maybe 5 seconds so who cares  I completely regret what i've done.   What are some quick things I can do when i feel the anger rushing in?
on my first day I was made fun of by these two other guys that work for her	I can't drive	Hi, I'm a 22 year old female and I don't know how to drive.  I've gotten a few driving lessons before from my sisters boyfriend but despite having more than 5 lessons I'm honestly terrified of driving.  I've tried everything in order to not be scared but I honestly can't help it.  I work for my older sister and  <e1> on my first day I was made fun of by these two other guys that work for her </e1>  because  <e2> I can't drive </e2> .  They kept making jokes and it really hurt my feelings and as great as it would be to prove them wrong. . . . I just mentally and physically feel like I can't! I'm just too scared! :( it's really sad and I know that I'm not the only person in this world who is over 20 and can't drive but it's extremely hurtful when people laugh or make jokes about it.  They don't understand that it's basically a mental disorder.  
In	supportive.	In those 5 days I noticed I had at least half a dozen opportunities to drink, and would have got wasted at least once if I wasn't actively resisting it.  My stomach feels a bit better and I started getting back to exercise, though it still gets irritated easily with heavy food.  I told a couple of my best friends and they have been supportive. 
It's like you're trapped in this little world, unable to do the simplest of task	people are around	Your heart racing.  Sweat dripping.  Stomach aching. You're like an outsider.  Watching all the people laughing with one another.  Best friends going out to eat, a boyfriend taking his girlfriend to the movies.  A lonesome man walking into the bar, greeted by a friendly bartender.  And then you, wishing you could do this too.  Be as *smooth* with conversations.  Not feel like you have to run at the invitation to a birthday party.  Not feeling sick by the simple hello while walking into the store. But you can't help it.  You're seemingly doomed to this fear of social situations.  You may not even know what it's from.  When you were little, people called you obedient, calm, respectful.  Maybe even shy.  Now look at you.  Thought to be rude, snobby.  Too good to talk with others.  But really, you just have social anxiety. Stuttering.  Slight blushing.  Shaking.  <e1> It's like you're trapped in this little world, unable to do the simplest of task </e1>  just because  <e2> people are around </e2> .  They said you'd get better.  They said you'd open up. But it's social anxiety. It just isn't that easy. 
I'm feeling a bit down and pretty anxious; I've been trying to get some kind of help, hopefully disability benefits	my anxiety and all that	 <e1> I'm feeling a bit down and pretty anxious; I've been trying to get some kind of help, hopefully disability benefits </e1> , because of  <e2> my anxiety and all that </e2> .  I used to work in retail, but in very short spurts because it stressed me out so much that I'd hurt myself during work hours or go home and do it.  I told them that, and they still sent me 4 letters (not sure why 4) today saying they don't think I'm disabled enough.  My mom has some experience with benefits and all that stuff (through her work) so is going to help me appeal, I'm just feeling so tired and so bad about myself I guess.  It took a lot for me to go to the SSI doctors and stuff and tell them how I cut myself and opening up about my issues (I have problems being around other people too, so that was really tough) and it just sucks being told that o
I've	shatters	I've got a really bad habit of throwing my controller whenever I get angry and I need something else I can throw that won't break something and I can put back together if it shatters 
Today	now!	Today I found the guts to compliment the attractive Starbucks barista when I got my coffee.  I don't know where I got these guts, but man, oh man, am I glad that I found them.  Fuck you social anxiety, I'm going to strike back now! 
I	around	I had a ticket to a show.  I arrived alone, 20 minutes early, pulled on the locked door to the bar as the bartenders inside watched me.  Then I ran upstairs to the resteraunt portion, looked around, and came back down to the entrance.  Someone working there noticed me, I asked where the show  was and he pointed to the wall right next to me where they post the times and said doors open at 8.  I didn't show up.  I wandered around
I couldn't even bring myself to get up from the bed	I am a sobbing mess	I don't know where to turn to, so hopefully someone can help me out.  A few nights ago I was so sad (and also drunk) that I cut myself pretty deep.  I went to a walk in clinic and then was escorted to the hospital by cops.  I wasnt suicidal; I was sad and unsure of what to do.  It was a cry for attention, something I now know.  Last night I was having a wonderful evening and this morning I woke up and  <e1> I couldn't even bring myself to get up from the bed </e1>  because  <e2> I am a sobbing mess </e2> .  I feel so alone yet I know I'm not.  I can't pin point my sadness, I just am.  So, like the title says, is it okay to just cry because I'm sad? I feel bad for crying, but I have no other way to express myself right now.  
4th	effects?	4th week of medication now.  I don't feel as down but feel kinda numb/sedated.  I also tried to fap but it was hard to stay erect and also hard to achieve orgasm.  Anyone else experiencing these effects?
I had to stop taking my medication	it didn't allow me to eat during lunch	I was lucky enough to go on vacation in South America and there eating schedule is very different from North America, so  <e1> I had to stop taking my medication </e1>  because  <e2> it didn't allow me to eat during lunch </e2> .  So now I have to be ready for the real life again and I've kinda forgotten what it feels like on medication, wish me luck.  I expect it to go swimmingly.  :)nEDIT: it went Alright, I made it to all the things I wanted to get to, but I overall felt more aware, the sad part is I was backstabbed by someone who told me I had gotten a job, but then went and hired everyone they needed without telling me, well better luck next time.  
During	spend.	During the summer I got my first car, card, and job so money has been flowing a lot.  But when I got a first taste of shopping by myself and shopping has been giving me this happy rush feeling now.  Even going to Walmart getting a toothbrush makes me happy.  It's so hard trying not to browse websites for sales every minute for sales or sales.  I'm currently trying not to spend anything unless I absolutely need it like face wash or school supplies.  I think my problem now is wasting my money on stupid food like coffee at Starbucks and Tim hortons.  Paying with cash doesn't seem to help and feels the same as paying with card so all I can do now is hoard money like there's no tomorrow.  Clothes are still like my babies especially shoes but I don't want to make my mom mad and keep wasting money so I'm pledging to save and not spend.  
It doesn't seem like it's outside the realm of possibility	I somehow ended up in a place that's very hell-like at least once	I'm afraid of going to hell.   <e1> It doesn't seem like it's outside the realm of possibility </e1> , since  <e2> I somehow ended up in a place that's very hell-like at least once </e2> .  Life is a cage.  Love feels like a trap.  Anyone feel me? I just want this to stop.  Everything that should be frivolous is taken so seriously.  There's pain everywhere and people will actively attempt to justify it, even admire it.  Like rationalizing it makes it any better.  I want this to stop.  I want this to stop.  I want this to stop.  I want this to stop.  I want this to stop.  I'm not going to do it but my mind is fucked beyond repair.  Thank you for listening. 
My	anxiety?	My kids have outgrown a lot of clothes/toys/etc from their first couple years.  I was in an abusive relationship with their father so it feels like those early years items contribute to my anxiety just by having them in storage.  I've sold a couple bags but I want all of it gone.  For some reason the idea of throwing it all away makes me feel a lot better than giving it away.  We don't have any donation places and people on Facebook yard sale sites just lie about needing things and resell.  I think its the physical act of throwing away the items that will make me feel better.  But then I feel guilty for not donating.  So I've been holding onto the items and get Anxiety just being around them if I go to my storage building for something else.  How do I choose what to do? Do I do what's I feel is better for my healing or donate, something that is adding anxiety?
for years I might have problems with attention, but it's gotten a lot worse after college	my schedule isn't as rigid and my future is more undefined (I'm 24 now	I've thought  <e1> for years I might have problems with attention, but it's gotten a lot worse after college </e1>  since  <e2> my schedule isn't as rigid and my future is more undefined (I'm 24 now </e2> .  Thinking about going to see a psychiatrist about a diagnosis. Just curious to hear what your tipping point was if you were diagnosed as an adult. 
The	again.	The title was just something I thought of today when I was sitting down under a new and very soft blanket my mum got me.  I thought I'd share that with you guys.  Hopefully one day we'll be in the warmth again.  
She's	monster	She's known I have depression and anxiety for a few years, my old therapist even told her she was the reason for my anxiety and part of the other thing.  Then she told me never to see her again.  Over the past few months i feel like things are getting worse for me, mentally.  I don't have any close friends to talk to anymore, and my really depressed talk got tiring, so they've told me to keep it to myself.  So I have no means of ever getting any of this stuff out.  But the real thing today is that my mom, who said she was hiding away a monster
it's	crying.	it's been a year i was diagnosed with anxiety.  one time when i was in the hospital (because of anxiety) with the heart rate tracking monitor attached to my finger, i kept looking at the monitor' screen to check the rate.  It went blank for some unknown reason.  the sad story that might make a normal person laugh is that i actually thought i am dead.  i took the monitor off my finger and put it again but it was still blank.  i looked at the bed where i was lying to check if there is a corpse and i'm just a spirit now. i went screaming at the doctors to bring back the rate on the screen. sadly they were laughing.  everytime i think about it i feel like crying. 
I started thinking about  my landlord and how he left his tools and gardening supplies for me, well organized and in immaculate condition.  As a result I have kept them organized as well	I don't want to be held responsible for them	So this just happened.  I was responding to a discussion here on organization techniques that don't work for ADHD and  <e1> I started thinking about  my landlord and how he left his tools and gardening supplies for me, well organized and in immaculate condition.  As a result I have kept them organized as well </e1> , because  <e2> I don't want to be held responsible for them </e2> .  Then I got to thinking about how at work one of the ladies kindly lets me use her small coffee machine and high quality coffee (as opposed to the tub of coffee available to everyone).  She cleans out the machine time she uses it and so I feel compelled to do the same thing.  Even though at home I NEVER clean my coffee machine.  My point is that whenever I am in charge of someone else's property where they took good care of it,  I feel compelled to keep it nice and spend way more time taking care of it.  I just wish I could apply this mentality to my own belongings.   Oh, here's the link for the thread that inspired me.  
After	weekend.	After today, I will be one week sober.   There have mostly been downs, but I just keep reminding myself why I'm choosing this path for myself.   I'm a sub for k-12 in my county and today (while at a middle school) I got a call from an elementary school I've subbed at asking if I would be interested in a long-term position for their EMI class.   It's just two children and the Aid and myself.  Cozy, with all the time in the world to devote to the two children.   EMI, for those who are unfamiliar, stands for extremely mentally impaired.   I think this will be a great learning experience for me and it will be a relief to have a steady job for the next few months.   PLUS! the pay is better after working so many consecutive days. The teacher I'm filling in for did not quit.   She's going on maternity leave for her first child!  Oh! and my credit went up! I officially have GOOD credit. So, please, wish me luck and I hope you all have a great weekend. 
circumstances I can't discuss due to the sub reddit rules	I've been having a really hard time getting to sleep	Because of  <e1> circumstances I can't discuss due to the sub reddit rules </e1>   <e2> I've been having a really hard time getting to sleep </e2> .  I've been awake for 53 hours now and I'm starting to hallucinate a little bit but what scares me more is that occasionally I could swear I hear someone in my house calling me while I have my headphones on listening to music but thats not the case.  Anyways, earlier today I was actually tired but forced myself to stay up to avoid messing up my sleep schedule any more than I already have.  Have you ever gone so far past the point of being tired that you aren't tired anymore? That's how I feel right now.  I can try lying down in the dark with my eyes closed but I just feel a huge rush of energy flowing through me.  Besides sleep aids or alcohol / drugs does anyone have any tips for falling asleep? I've tried several methods I've read up online and also took a few melatonin (since it's naturally occurring) but I'm still up.  I'm pretty much open to any tips at this point.  
I	.	I have my Math mid term exams, starting tomorrow.  I've not studied enough; my friends are wondering why I keep asking them how to solve easy sums.  I know I'm smart; I passed last year with 100%.  I can solve hard sums and ace everything normally, but now, I feel like an idiot.  I've been mild to moderately depressed, and I self harm.  I want to punish myself for my stupidity.  My mother saw my marks from scratching myself really badly, and she yelled at me for being an idiot.  Today, I just cracked a really tough sum which everyone was having trouble with, but my mom got into a fight with me later on, making my mood go straight down.  I tried talking to her about it, and asked that I wanted to see a therapist.  She got furious and told me that I was perfectly normal.  I'm afraid; I don't want to disappoint everyone with an A.  Everyone in my family, and my teachers expect an A*.  I'm panicking, and I'm punching myself in the face, now.  Help. . . Sorry if this seems broken up; I'm trying to crack a stupid 2 mark sum. . . . . . 
When	up??	When you have to be up late and feeling a bit sleepy what do you do?I know coffee for most of us makes us calm and focused.  I have to be up late tonight and didn't sleep well last night and got up super early, are there any tips you have for staying up??
So	effects)?	So I'm really bad at starting new meds and I need some help/encouragement.  I've been taking Xanax for years to control my anxiety and panic attacks.  I've tried other antidepressants on and off, but I never stuck with any of them.  I've been having terrible anxiety lately and can barely go to work.  The Xanax alone isn't cutting it anymore.  My doctor prescribed Zoloft 50mg for my depression and anxiety.  But I'm afraid to take it. Has anyone tried this medication? Did you have any luck (or horrible side effects)?
I can't tell if my disappointment	I don't know enough, and I got my hopes up for just one of the many ways to address this	[This is why I went in]( reddit. com/r/ADHD/comments/3ghdtx/help_49_year_old_male_wadhd_at_his_wits_end/) to talk to my doctor for the first time about medicating my ADHD. He recommended we try Escitalopram first.  10MG a day for a month, and see if it helps.  Anyone else have experience with this solution?I am really disappointed.  I really wanted to get onto an ADHD drug specifically.  But  <e1> I can't tell if my disappointment </e1>  is just because  <e2> I don't know enough, and I got my hopes up for just one of the many ways to address this </e2> . I am also disappointed because I've been told this takes a week or two to kick in.  And I really wanted to feel a difference today. Anyway, I am going to go through with the prescribed month of this.  And meet with my doctor again to see where I am at that point, and what course to take next. 
For	experience?	For me personally I become nauseous and occasionally will vomit from it.  If my depression becomes soul sucking and breaks me down for multiple days at a time it can induce a seizure (I'm epileptic).   What do you guys experience?
I have, however, been diagnosed with ADHD	the mood swings	I haven't officially been diagnosed (it's a long story), but I have a very good feeling that I do have BPD since I fit most of the criteria listed in the DSM - V (I study mental health and counselling and have access to the text).   <e1> I have, however, been diagnosed with ADHD </e1>  because of  <e2> the mood swings </e2> , irritability, impulsive behaviour, etc, (on top of the attention deficits) so I'm prescribed stimulants to get my school work done.  They're helpful. . . until they wear off.  Some of the all day medication I've taken in the past has actually managed to make me feel suicidal out of seemingly nowhere, or has otherwise given me a full on nervous breakdown.  I'm wondering if anyone else has experience with BPD and ADHD and taking stimulants? They literally make all of my *suspected* BPD symptoms so much worse but going without means I have the added stress of not doing well in school. . .  its a bit of a catch 22.  
Concerta	anyone?	Concerta has transformed my life.  I went from being completely hopeless to having a lot of confidence to apply myself in the job market, and produced such a strong master's dissertation that the university wants to publish it with me.  This was against my earlier situation, where I was failing courses and very low on confidence job-wise. My dose went up to 54mg from 36mg.  I had a two-day medication holiday before starting the new prescription. Surprisingly, the 54mg dose, since I started, has not had nearly as much of a noteceable effect as 36mg.  I notice old behaviours creeping back in: checking Reddit and Facebook in middle of work tasks. . .  reading news for 2 hours, procrastinating on work. . . Has anyone else experienced this effect after having their dose increased? This seems very strange to me.  What was your experience?I should note that my dose has actually been increased accidentally - my doctor issued a 54mg prescription but we did not discuss increasing the dose.  Somehow I only noticed today that this was different from the dose I had been taking (typical ADHD memory I guess). . . Any advice from anyone?
there's no one I can exert my anger on	who can I feel angry on if it was technically my fault	I have given up on big joys of life, I thought I had depression under control, enjoying small things, trying to make people smile, being confident, spontaneous but today just shattered me.  It was such a simple thing, it is what I call a tax on clumsiness, a fine for losing a ticket, and yet I skipped work, ceased exercise, I don't know if I'll go to college or work tomorrow.  I'm just weak,  <e1> there's no one I can exert my anger on </e1>  since  <e2> who can I feel angry on if it was technically my fault </e2>  Yet everything feels like getting in my way to be more productive.  Suicide is knocking on my doors yet again, alluring me with her sweet, sweet promises of comfort, but would I have the guts to take her on the offer? I don't know.  No one's going to understand that I feel relapsing again, they'll lock me up again if I as to squeak about it.  It was such a promising day. 
I can't really take naps	how long it takes me to fall asleep	Long story short, I went from 30mg/day straight to 0, and still only feel slightly less sluggish today.  I attribute it to being anemic and/or having an autoimmune disorder, but I do miss having energy. How do you guys tackle your exhaustion on slower days?I'm posting in this sub because ever since I quit Adderall, coffee has been essentially knocking me out.  I've given it multiple times since coming back to college, and the timeline is always the same: 9am, drink coffee-based drink.  9:30am, feel a little scatterbrained.  10am, start yawning like crazy and struggle to keep my eyes open during lecture.  11am, go back to my room and practically fall asleep standing up. The downside is,  <e1> I can't really take naps </e1>  because of  <e2> how long it takes me to fall asleep </e2>  (I have a tight class schedule and little time to study).  Coffee has been making me more useless; I'm both confused and curious as to why I'm now getting that ADHD paradoxical reaction I've always heard about.  Half a cup used to have me wired
Just wondering if it's likely to make me feel as crappy as the first week I started taking it	it's midterm season and it would suck to have to go through that + midterms	Hey, quick question.  Asking here because I have to play phone tag to contact my doctor, + they're not open until Monday. Currently on 10 mg of cipralex, but it hasn't been working as well as it used to.  I called about increasing my dose maybe, and they told me that it would be fine if I just took two pills (making my dose 20 mg) and got back to them with how it was working for me in a few weeks.  This was all by voicemail, so I couldn't just ask then.  <e1> Just wondering if it's likely to make me feel as crappy as the first week I started taking it </e1> ,as   <e2> it's midterm season and it would suck to have to go through that + midterms </e2> . Thank you!
Hi,	locally.	Hi, is there anyone in Liverpool UK? Just curious really.  Could rant about ADHD locally. 
Trying	distracted.	Trying to figure out how the hell I can do this.  Everytime I get exhausted and take a break, I either 1) never go back to the task at hand or 2) am always even more distracted when I do return.  I set alarms, make schedules, take my meds, etc.  But I always seem to be able to rationalize procrastination when I need to return to work / study.  Any advice?tl;dr take break while doing task.  Either never go back to task or return to task super distracted. 
I'll admit that I do feel detached from my emotions	I see them as unruly things prone to clouding my judgement	Before I got sober I got super-invested the intimate relationships I had.  They were my higher power, even to the extent that I could stop drinking.  My SO became my new drug.  In trying to please the other person and make them happy, I  lost myself.  Now I am aware of that I am very guarded of my level of investment; maintaining that I am more invested in myself than in the other person.  I have been described as cold, calculating, inhuman,  out of touch with my emotions. . .  Yet I feel very aware of my own needs and that I am responsible for my own happiness.   And the other person is responsible for their own happiness.  I can't make you feel anything.  Not really.  <e1> I'll admit that I do feel detached from my emotions </e1>  in that  <e2> I see them as unruly things prone to clouding my judgement </e2>  - I try to postpone interactions when I become emotional, returning after I have had a chance to calm down and regain awareness.  But it distresses me to think I come off as cold.  What are your thoughts, reddit?
I even stopped seeing my precious therapist	they told me my depression didn't matter and I didn't matter	I don't know if this is even the right place I just. . .  I feel horrid. .  I want to cry. .  I feel useless. . .  I feel like I should kill myself or cut and yet I promised myself I would never do anything to upset anyone. . .  It doesn't help that everywhere I apply every where and I keep getting You aren't suited or We don't need you.  I get they found suitable workers I'm happy for them. .  Just. .  My depression my family refuses to acknowledge that my therapist and others have seen feel like they refuse to help. .   <e1> I even stopped seeing my precious therapist </e1>  because  <e2> they told me my depression didn't matter and I didn't matter </e2> . . .  Why I'm so depresased and such in high school I was practically locked in my room with nothing but my XBox
I	?	I used to get depressed more than half a year ago but it went, and I honestly thought I was getting better.  Now I've moved back to uni it's come back, and I hate it.  I don't want to get out of bed or do the most basic chore.  My anxiety is bad as well, I always feel like people are looking at me, judging me.  I've started drinking a lot of alcohol and now I can't seem to stop myself.  I keep dreaming that I kill myself, and it's beginning to scare me.  I don't know what to do, I really don't want to go to the doctors or anything.  I just get so lonely. . .  Anyone know any coping mechanisms that doesn't involve alcohol ? 
Either I'll take a day off, or just take it on and off for a few days	I don't need it	To be clear I take my medication regularly, but sometimes I don't always want to be on medication.  <e1> Either I'll take a day off, or just take it on and off for a few days </e1>  because  <e2> I don't need it </e2> .  My question is how bad is it for you to take Adderall, or any ADD stimulant medication on and off? Specifically on your brain, I can only assume dopamine levels etc being so inconsistent can't be good.  Also does anyone know of any websites where there's more information about this? I feel like there's isn't the best information about ADD meds out there already, but lately I've been curious on what it does to your brain when taken inconsistently. 
I don't plan on being ADHD tested	as I'm already taking meds	For a long time, I considered ADHD to be a faux-disorder.  I frequently argued with people on Reddit and real life about it.  Last week, I switched from Nuvigil to Adderall to treat my narcolepsy.  While the Adderall kept me awake, it also rid me of my anxiety and depression I've had for years.  I am calm and collected in a way I have never been before.  While  <e1> I don't plan on being ADHD tested </e1>  ( <e2> as I'm already taking meds </e2> ), my doctors agree that I likely have it.  I guess life has a sense of irony!
The endless searching and especially tense interviews with no call-backs. . .	it all causes me a substantial amount of anxiety to the point where thinking about it makes me nauseous	I need to find a full-time job again and I don't know how I can do it this time.   <e1> The endless searching and especially tense interviews with no call-backs. . .  </e1>   <e2> it all causes me a substantial amount of anxiety to the point where thinking about it makes me nauseous </e2> .  How are people with low self-confidence and insecurity issues actually hired for professional jobs? The old adage fake it til you make it can only go so far.  I feel like the interviewers will see through my lack of confidence pretty quickly. 
So	there.	So I was excited at first for group therapy but I think I went to the wrong type of group therapy.  The biggest problem was that it wasn't geared at people with anxiety.  It was just people with problems.  One lady was being taken advantage of from her son by taking all her money.  Another guy was bipolar.  One guy suffered from ptsd and only one other lady dealt with anxiety although oddly enough she seemed so calm. It was a couple of hours of people just sort of spilling their problems.  I just sat there the entire time listening.  I need direction.  I need a group that's going to help me get out of my shell.  I sort of need to be told what to do.  Does that sound right? Is this what social anxiety groups should be like? I'm going to keep searching to see if there's anything else out there. 
you're nervous and shy and eye contact scares you these days	you avert your gaze by default	It's like noticing God is looking at you.  Like, right at you.  Focused for a split second of his eternity entirely on you.  But  <e1> you're nervous and shy and eye contact scares you these days </e1> , so  <e2> you avert your gaze by default </e2> , only to blink back immediately to catch His eyes, but they're gone.  Just an empty space next to your friend, whose voice slowly fills your ears again.    It's so fleeting and makes you wonder if you saw anything at all.  But you can't explain this floating feeling your heart makes every time you think of it.  And you cry on cue, even with a wistful smile on your lips.    That's what a moment of hope feels like when you're depressed.  It feels like God starting to look your way.  .  
I don't think it's a nervousness thing	it hasn't bothered me in a while	i am curious whether this is a thing that other ADHDers deal with more than others.  I recently looked up the statistics and it's rarer than i thought (something like 7%).  I'm wondering if it's more highly represented in people with ADHD. I have always been nearly totally unable to urinate around other people.   <e1> I don't think it's a nervousness thing </e1> , because  <e2> it hasn't bothered me in a while </e2> . Recently, i started medication (Concerta) and since, i've had no issue with this at all.  i've also found my social anxiety is down so that could be related. 
he diagnosed me with moderate Pure-O OCD	intrusive thoughts that stopped me from doing certain things or going to certain events	hello.  new to OCD. to keep a story short.  job sent me to a new psychiatrist and  <e1> he diagnosed me with moderate Pure-O OCD </e1>  for  <e2> intrusive thoughts that stopped me from doing certain things or going to certain events </e2>  (I thought it was social anxiety.  maybe OCD can cause social anxiety? if anyone has an answer to that I would gladly accept it).  the doc started me on Fluvoxamine at 200mg (ultrarapid metabolizer of the medicine).  and what I have noticed more than anything was that I seem to have an increased anxiety while driving (which I never ever had. ).  before I could zip around with the best of them.  now I am super jumpy at cars switching lanes and braking and fear going higher speeds.  there are other things that I have never batted an eye at that are causing me a slight disturbance, but the driving one is a big one.  my original question is: does anyone who has used  Luvox/Fluvoxamine or any SSRI ever have increased anxiety during use or starting the use of one? 
I	way?	I recently started dorming at a very social university.   I have minor social anxiety but I would say my circumstances have forced me to step out of my comfort zone, in a positive way.   However, there is always this mindset when I speak to certain people that they just see me as a resource to them.   For instance, if I meet someone in my major, I feel as if they are adding me to their collection of connections.   whereas if I meet a random person and we just talk, sometimes I can sense that they are just seeking a friend.   I know this thinking is flawed but does anyone else feel the same way?
I	anymore.	I am eligible to receive extended time during exams and can choose to take them in a low distraction environment.    I am in a class that is very difficult and having extended time on the exams would be really helpful, but I am very close with the professor.  He is one who has strict testing policies with no extra time allowed.  (My Uni accommodation trumphs this) He currently thinks highly of me and I want to approach him to ask for my extended time I am eligible for but I don't want his opinion to change such that he doesn't see me as a high caliber student anymore. 
I'm	do.	I'm a constant ball of anxiety and stress.  I get so angry all the time.  It's gotten to the point where I'm tired of waking up and dealing with it.  I can't even force myself to leave the house.  I've put on 22 pounds in a month and a half I lost my job.  I feel pathetic but I can't get ahold of myself I feel like I'm spiraling out of control.  It's taking everything I have not to freak out.  I'm just so lost.  Idk what to do. 
the time pressure and impending doom	made me go into hyper focus	I'm not really sure why I do it anymore.  I used to think that it was because of  <e1> the time pressure and impending doom </e1>  that  <e2> made me go into hyper focus </e2> , but could it be because of something else?  I have a theory that it has something to do with my sleepiness and/or the lack of distracting sounds (I also have Asperger's too but I'm not sure if I have hypersensitivity because of it or ADHD) as well as the timed pressure that looms over me.  Dunno.  The one thing that I DO know is that if I could get the same motivation that I get 1 hour before an assignment is due and use this motivation during the DAY, then I would take that over a stupid all-nighter any day.  Seriously.  That's the only thing that I can be certain of: I fucking *hate* all-nighters.  But what choice do I have?

It just makes me really sad	I don't want to be medicated forever	I was diagnosed with a major episode of depression back in 2011, and I've been on medication ever since.  About 2 years ago I was put on zoloft, I was on 150mg but once I started to feel better and not have as many panic attacks I put myself down to 100mg.  In the past couple of weeks I've been having panic attacks and bouts of obsessive worrying, and I think I may need to go back to 150mg.   <e1> It just makes me really sad </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want to be medicated forever </e2> .  I was always anxious as a teen and young adult, but it was never this severe, and I don't want to be anxious for the rest of my life.   There's no one I know personally that has an experience similar to mine, and it's hard to talk about it with friends and family, so I'd just like to hear someone else's experience with anxiety and medication. 
I nearly broke down in tears	there was a song that fit what goes on in my head on a daily basis	So, earlier today, I was listening to music, when my favorite band, Bring Me the Horizon came on.  One of their new songs, Avalanche, came on, and for the past two weeks or so, I've listened to that song at least twice daily, and I could never figure out why.  It just seemed to resonate with how I feel with my ADHD.  I listened to the track commentary by Oli Sykes, the lead singer, just to find out that he himself was recently diagnosed with ADHD.  And Avalanche was written about his experience with this monster of a disorder.   <e1> I nearly broke down in tears </e1>  that  <e2> there was a song that fit what goes on in my head on a daily basis </e2> .  If you guys get a chance, listen to the song and really listen to the lyrics.  They mean so much to me and I hope they can for you. 
I just don't know how I will take stuff like people laughing and mocking it	I'm goimg to be in the audience too and it just seems so embarrassing	Today I'm presenting a short film in front of an audience, I ran into a lot issues during pre and post production and I think it could've been a lot better than it ended up being but I'm still very proud of the sole fact that I made it.  However, I'm very nervous about how people will react to it, it's not a personal story or anything but  <e1> I just don't know how I will take stuff like people laughing and mocking it </e1> , especially because  <e2> I'm goimg to be in the audience too and it just seems so embarrassing </e2> .    Anybody knows how to deal with this sort of feeling?
Hi!	now	Hi! My husband has pretty severe ADD.   He FINALLY saw the light and got himself on adderral  and it's been night and day!! It's him but better I would have to say.  He's focused and calm and SO MUCH HAPPIER.   He feels great and the biggest improvement I've noticed is that he isn't aggravated by every little thing.    His ADD makes him easy to get irritated and overwhelmed.  The medication has been a godsend to me.  I don't have to top toe around certain situations that I know would overwhelm him.  (I'd love to not have the Reddit brigade of jerks telling me to divorce him over this last sentence please- ADD is part of his personality and he's a good person--anyone married to ADD/ADHD knows what I'm talking about).    My question is will there come a time that my husband might say I'm in control now
Everything has felt flat for some time	I find everything boring	 <e1> Everything has felt flat for some time </e1> .    <e2> I find everything boring </e2> .   I want stimulation.   No amount of surfing the web, reading books, watching movies, exercising, or any other activities have scratched the itch.   It's time like these that illicit drugs are most inviting, but I'm saying no.   It'll be nice to be really into something again and do it in a sober manner.   I'm aware of the irony but I will welcome some hyperfocusing right now. 
You	it.	You can look st my previous post via profile if you want the details but essentially I'm really sad lol.   Any of you have tips for how to get out of it. 
I feel nervous	I said something wrong or everyone is ignoring me	Nobody comments on my posts in here and I don't know why.  I posted 2 posts in this subreddit and hardly got any reply or comments.   <e1> I feel nervous </e1>  that  <e2> I said something wrong or everyone is ignoring me </e2> 
I'm	you?	I'm going through a break up again.  We took a month and a half break and tried working it out.  My short temper has caused issues in the relationship.  This is the second guy I've dated that has called me out on my short temper and just being easily mad over little things.  I'm tired of fighting with people I care about.   Has anyone tried Meditation? How has it worked for you?
Hi	though!	Hi Everyone,  This is my first post here.  I was diagnosed with ADD around 6 months ago and since then have been put on Ritalin which has been working quite well for me.   I live in Australia and have been working with an insurance broker to organise income protection insurance as my wife and I have just purchased a house and are hoping to have children.  The broker came back to me today and said that the main insurance company he deals with and a few others have flat out denied my request for insurance due to my diagnosis.   Has anyone else come across anything like this? I was expecting an exclusion on mental heath at most but not a flat out rejection .   Some reading mentions discrimination laws, I thought I would check here before getting in too deep though! 
getting annoyed	my newsfeed is to slow	Maybe this is not the right sub, but I am interested in your thoughts regarding my situation.   I am currently unemployed and I have a lot of time on my hands.  It is not like a have cravings for information when not on the pc or a fear of missing out on social media, but when I am online one way or an other, I feel I lose control over my ability to stop surfing the web.  I will sit at my computer until I have to run to the bathroom.  I often get hungry or thirsty but neglect to act on it.  I postpone anything that will require my attention for more than just a minute.   I ping pong aimlessly between Facebook, Youtube and Reddit  <e1> getting annoyed </e1>  that  <e2> my newsfeed is to slow </e2> .  It is like I am waiting for the perfect moment to do something other than being online.  It is not quit time for dinner yet
Hey	Pharmacy.	Hey all.  Throwaway account here, longtime lurker.  I was just curious how much everyone here pays to see their doc and get scripts filled.  Also, what pharmacy do you use?  With my insurance (Unitedhealthcare HMO) I pay $ 10 for my monthly GP visit to get my script and $ 20 for Vyvanse (generics are only $ 5 but sadly Vyvanse is still brand. ) I use Costco Pharmacy. 
They also offer ear plugs	the rooms aren't completely sound proof	and wooOOOOW IT WAS FANTASTIC.  My uni has a little building built into a hill so most of it is underground, and it's sole purpose is to provide a private, distraction free test environment for students that need it.    Anyway so the lady at the desk was super nice, she showed me my test room, the washroom and the break room (one of my accommodations is breaks that don't take from my time in case I feel myself getting off track and want to clear my head for a bit) which has a little kitchenette.  (finals are 3 hours, I get time and a half, some people get double time, if you're writing an exam for six hours, you're going to want a snack break)   So the room just has a desk against the wall, facing opposite the door so you can't see out the window, and a little wall mounted fan, in case it gets toasty.   <e1> They also offer ear plugs </e1>  as  <e2> the rooms aren't completely sound proof </e2> .  The lady asked if I wanted warnings at certain time points but I said no.  I was allowed to take in my snacks and hinking putty
Anyone	.	Anyone taking meds and also have issues with sex?  I am 21 male and have been having these kind of issues for years now.  Basically I find it a lot harder to get and maintain an erection while on Vyvanse (still difficult without vyvanse).  And I also feel disinterested in having sex or any kinds of foreplay for some reason.  I have tried Viagra but it only gives me an erection that disappears right before intercourse.    I am feeling so frustrated. . . . 
i've hit rock bottom multiple times	i feel totally hopeless	 <e1> i've hit rock bottom multiple times </e1> .  i quit drinking, i think i can start again, i start, i quit.   <e2> i feel totally hopeless </e2> .  i have never really liked the idea of AA.  and i don't want that to be my only way sober.  i find i start drinking again due to my anxiety levels.  i just get bored and look for a problem.  everything in my life is beautiful, great, fun and full of love. .  and when that happens i itch to drink.  it's like my conscious wants me to fuck it all up.  i don't know how to cut the bad people who i only see when im drinking.  i function, shit gets done but i end up hating the person i am.  the next morning i'm depressed and even more anxious.  i know i need to requit again but this time i feel like what's the point? i'm scared and hopeless. . .  and reaching out.  please help me. 
I	visit	I used to have a few good friends, and I would hang out with them and have no problems.  Now that I have gotten married and moved to a new city (an hour an a half away from home and old friends), I have gotten really shy and less outgoing.  With old friends, whenever they say Oh when you visit home we should hang out! When I do visit
I	more	I was in a meeting with two of my group members from school and a professor the other day.  We were talking about what he assigned us to do.  I was telling him that I had spent an hour searching for results in this search engine, and still hadn't found anything.  He went on to say that I should have spent more time looking and I told him how difficult that would be for me without breaks because of my ADHD.    Then he told me that I had to stop using ADHD as a crutch and that I'll eventually grow out of it.    I don't know how you guys would react to that, but after a moment of shocked silence I told him, I don't think that's how it works.  He also said that he takes letters of disclosure that students give him and makes paper airplanes out of them.  It's almost like he was trying to wind me up.    There's more
I've	support.	I've been on jury duty this week.  This morning in line at the cafeteria, the man wearing a suit in front of me (I assume he was an attorney) had the look of a heavy drinker: puffy eyes, bloated face, red skin, tiny beads of sweat on the brow.  Maybe I am prejudiced, seeing something that's not there.  But anyway, it made me think about my own life and drinking habits.     The myth of the 'functional alcoholic' is insidious.  Unbeknownst to this individual, anyone can see that 'functional' is no way to live.  I remember being in this man's shoes, struggling to keep it together and act professional.  Just get the job done.     I'm happy with my decision to move beyond functional.  I hope others do so as well.  Thanks to everyone here for their support. 
Some	:'(	Some days I'll be happy no matter what.  I'll have all the energy in the world to do anything I want or need to do.  I'll be able to function at either of my jobs, in grad school, around the house, with friends.  Other days I can hardly get up out of bed.  I feels like my entire life is crumbling around me.  I worked so hard to get into grad school and now that I'm there, I'm failing my classes.  I saw the school counselor and several others in recent years, but no one can help.  The only thing that will end my lows is killing myself.    I'm 22, trans, and alone and that's how I'll be when they find me.  I don't want to burden my friends or what remains of my family with feeling depressed or suicidal.  I told my mom that I used to cut myself, and she said she knew the entire time and that I was a failure.  My dad can't stand to be around me.    I'm a failure.  I'm so sorry.   :'( 
I'm not really sure what to do	the decision affects the conclusion of my article somewhat	Currently I'm writing a short article for my University's newspaper about psychiatric disorders, mental health, and my experience of living with ADHD so far.  But I'm having an internal conflict about whether to write the article anonymously or not.  On the one hand, the article is a call for people to stop downplaying issues of mental health (like telling depressed people to just be happy, or people with ADHD to just stop being lazy) and I feel that if I identify myself publicly like that as having a psychiatric disorder that it may help break down some stigmas and barriers and help people talk about these issues with their friends.  On the other hand however, I fear having the article listed under my own name, in case future potential employers might find it and use it as a reason to not hire me.    <e1> I'm not really sure what to do </e1> , because  <e2> the decision affects the conclusion of my article somewhat </e2> .  I need some help figuring this out.  
Just up went from 20 to 40 mg of Latuda on Wednesday	Sometimes I feel great	 <e1> Just up went from 20 to 40 mg of Latuda on Wednesday </e1> .   <e2> Sometimes I feel great </e2> , I'm happy have enough energy to make to through the day and enjoy myself.  Other times I'm not depressed but it feels like I have no feeling.  I don't enjoy anything and I just feel wrong.  It's hard to explain but I just want it to stop.  Honestly I think I would rather be depressed then feel like this.  At least depressed I feel something.  Last night was pretty rough and I thought maybe if I sleep when I wake up I will be better.  Today is better but still no great.  This is so hard. 
i have to write it down somewhere where im anonymous	i do it here	hello i just dont know what to do currently, but  <e1> i have to write it down somewhere where im anonymous </e1> , so  <e2> i do it here </e2> .  im 26 and have been affected by ocd basically since puberty.  there are phases where i generally have it under control, but right now its just so strong again.  and its not just the rituals, the compulsions, but the fear in my head.  i feel like anything i do is leading to disastrous results and that i need to stay strong and not let it take over, but its just so much.  im literally fighting the urge to cry, but i really dont know what to do right now.  i hate this illness, i hate that it takes control over me, i hate that it paralyzes my entire life, i hate that i cant enjoy anything without feeling that this joy is in constant jeopardy.  i have no clue what to do right now
22M.	ready	22M.  My life isn't as shitty as I feel it to be.  I come from a decent family with a steady income and have graduated from higher education.  I have a good job.  I have a great gf.  My dad is a bit emotionally abusive, but otherwise my life is pretty good.    I've had suicidal ideation for 4 years.  It used to emerge when I was upset, now it is daily.  I researched and planned, finding a pain free method.  I stocked up on the necessary supplies.  I'm ready
Edit:	help	Edit: sorry about the title.  I meant emergency.  My bad  I currently live in New Zealand but I have some person I care about within the US.  Assuming I had this person's address, is it possible to alert 911?  Just gathering info to help secure this person's best interests.   Thanks so much for all your help
Ritalin	do.	Ritalin has opened my eyes.  For the first time in my life I sat down with a task and i just finished it.  40 pages of history reading done in 1 hour, just like that.    It has finally brought my brain under control.  I feel like when i tell myself to do something it just does it, nothing gets in the way, the little things don't make me lose focus, I can just do it.  Its amazing what a little pill can do.  
I'd gone 2 weeks without drinking	felt really proud	I'm 18 and for the past year or so my weekends and days off have consisted of finding a way to get some sort of alcohol in me.  I have a long line of alcoholics in my family.   <e1> I'd gone 2 weeks without drinking </e1>  and  <e2> felt really proud </e2>  but my buddy came back and ya know old habbits.  I went a little over board and woke up late for school, missed my midterm and had to call in sick to work due to the hangover. . . . anyone have any ideas on how to get/stay clean? Open to all options. . 
It	down	It may sound like a horrible idea, but I really don't know what to do any more.    I'm 17 and in 11th grade, every single morning I wake up and can't think of anything else but dying.  None of it seems worth it, it's like I'm throwing what little time of my life I have into something that makes life even less fulfilling and more depressing.  Sure, I definitely sound like a whiny little bitch, but there's other things I want to learn.  I don't want to dedicate my time in a place where the teacher just goes write this down
I did this	I had been catching myself getting irrationally angry at my friends out of envy	A little over a month ago, I deleted my twitter account and deactivated my facebook account.   <e1> I did this </e1>  because  <e2> I had been catching myself getting irrationally angry at my friends out of envy </e2> ; I felt like they were living the lives I wanted but couldn't have.  I took time away in order to work on my own life.    Upon some reflection this morning, I'm wondering if not being on social media is actually helping perpetuate my depression.  Not having to face the world has forced me to work on myself, but it is also serving as a form of isolation.   Given this, is being off social media actually doing more harm than good?
I	customer	I thought some folks here might benefit from a resource I discovered and started using a while back.   A lot of computer programmers like to have music on in the background when they're working, but if it's the wrong *kind* of music, it can be more distracting than helpful.   Too many lyrics, or too many of certain kinds of changes. . .  it can just drag you right out of your task.   I'm a programmer who has ADHD (first diagnosed as an adult over 20 years ago), and I started listening to this stuff, and I found that it helps me a little bit when I want to focus on *anything*.   The pieces I've listened to are kinda ambient background-type stuff, without lyrics, and without sudden changes in tempo or volume or anything like that.   Sometimes, they help me block out some background distractions without being distracting themselves, which has been great.   Anyhow, here's the link:   net  (I'm not involved with it, just a satisfied customer
am frustrated as hell	I have no family or friends that really get my issue	Please forgive this rant.   I just dumped another bottle down the drain and  <e1> am frustrated as hell </e1>  and  <e2> I have no family or friends that really get my issue </e2> .  Every morning and afternoon I tell myself I'm not going to have any tonight.   But when I get home from work, the habitual actions of cracking open a beer or pouring a glass of wine just take over without so much as a thought.   It's not even until I get through that first one that I remember what I had told myself.   And by then I'm fighting the notion that, well I already screwed it up today
I	feeling?	I have posted a couple times on here recently and I have just now finally started taking medication for my adhd.  my doctor prescribed me 15 mg adderall xr and the first day was great and everything and I'm starting to feel the effects less and less but I suppose thats pretty normal but thats not really what my concern is.  Since starting it I keep having this feeling of impending doom, like I'm forgetting something that I should be worried about.  Its really weird.  Like theres something I am supposed to do and I can't remember or something.  does anyone else ever get that feeling? 
I went to a psychiatrist mostly	focusing issues	 <e1> I went to a psychiatrist mostly </e1>  because of  <e2> focusing issues </e2> .  I was almost certain I had adhd.  I got diagnosed with ocd, anxiety and depression.  I was put on prozac and for the first week I was kinda able to focus for some reason.  It went back to the usual lack of focus.  But now I've been on it for about 6 weeks and for the past 2 weeks I've been having more ypical ADHD symptoms and my focusing has gotten even worse.  I used to zone out and get intrusive thoughts from the ocd
the	control	the last few days, after eating dinner, i've still been hungry, despite finsihing my food completely.  I have taken pristiq for about 2 weeks now (100mg) and i took it last year, don't remember why i stopped.    Last time i went from really sad to neutral, for i while i went from neutral to happy (off pristiq) and recently i'm neutral again.  I was thinking, if it made me neutral before, it would change to happy if i start at neutral, if that makes sense.   Anyway i'm super hungry right now.  Has this happened to anyone else? I'm going to ask my doctor when i next see her (for a different issue though)  i would appreciate any answers  also i just read the rules, i am 16f, social anxiety and depression, live in australia and also take yaz flex birth control
I feel like shit	my neighbor opens their balcony door and I can hear their kids in there while I'm standing outside poisoning their air	Whatever my flair says is a lie.   I don't know why I've gone down this path again.  I've recommended Allen Carr's book to so many people.  I've had a couple successful quits, this one lasting for a couple years.  My girlfriend doesn't know.  I'm not allowed to smoke at my job.   <e1> I feel like shit </e1>  when  <e2> my neighbor opens their balcony door and I can hear their kids in there while I'm standing outside poisoning their air </e2> .  I want to enjoy life.  I want to be free from it again.  I want to use my body for good.  Working out.  Eating right.  I thought I could get away with smoking blunts, but that turned into adding a little bit of tobacco, then a little more, then saying Fuck it
Hey	anxiety	Hey r/ADHD, I have a chronic worrying problem.  This problem usually exists when I am not on my medication.  Nonetheless, I often go on the internet and find people saying that extended adderall use can be harmful and cause side effects such as anhedonia.  I constantly find myself worried about how I take this as medicine every day and how it might be harmful in the long run.  Is there any way to combat this worry? Are there any books I can read that might put me at ease? Any advice from you guys?  I've read Driven to Distraction and thought it was excellent.  I have ADHD with anxiety

Hello	help.	Hello ADHD,  I'm a little concerned with the implications ADHD has on my driving ability.  Do you have any tips on staying focused and aware? I keep making major mistakes that are making me feel like I should just park my car from now on.  Please help.  
It just makes me mad	it perpetuates a misconception	Does anyone else get irritated by bipolar jokes? Oh that's so bipolar etc.  Today on /r/StartledCats there was a gif of two cats licking each other and then one freaks out and starts hitting the other one.  The top comment for awhile was I'm pretty sure all cats suffer from bipolar disorder.   <e1> It just makes me mad </e1>  because  <e2> it perpetuates a misconception </e2> .  That's not at all what bipolar disorder is like.  I made a comment on it and ended up getting down voted (big surprise). 
but the thought of speaking up in class, going to a conference, being asked on a date	terrifies me	So I'm sitting here with a therapist's number, trying to decide if I should call to ask about starting sessions or not.    I've had anxiety since I was a child, but it's much much better now.  My biggest issue at this point is social anxiety. . . I'm fine with friends or medium-sized groups,  <e1> but the thought of speaking up in class, going to a conference, being asked on a date </e1> , etc.   <e2> terrifies me </e2> .  Sometimes it's knots in my stomach, sometimes it's a full-out night of not sleeping, probably puking, etc.    My other big issue I guess is that I get so easily distracted by worries.  I'll be studying, and something slightly worrying will come up (I forgot to fill out that form!)
My	because	My twin brother was diagnosed with ADHD-CT at a very early age (VERY noticeable) so I was constantly tested and always came back as negative.   I grew up in a household that had very inconsistent rules (I'd just be getting used to a rule, like always shut the gate, then the new rule would be to always leave it open.   Or I just never knew what I was supposed to do or not supposed to do).     Around puberty I was finally diagnosed with ADHD-PI and I've been battling with it since.   I recently read some things that made me wonder if the inconstancy of my upbringing cause my fight or flight to be permanently turned on and possibly the cause of my adhd.     My google research found that the fight or flight response is caused by an overactive sympathetic nervous system and the symptoms of such is surprisingly similar to ADHD.     I did further research and found that there are two easy ways to possibly suppress the fight or flight response; switching to a keto diet and stimulating the vagus nerve using a TENS machine.   Within a week of starting the diet I felt amazing!  I actually started laughing because
Not	(8am).	Not been in work for 3 days, I just want to curl up in a ball and punish myself.  Need to change my outlook and mind set on life, need to get away from these 4 walls and even Manchester for a bit.  Started on my citalopram last week again after having a break (couldn't afford the prescription) and I feel they're not doing anything.  Been a tough fucking year and I just don't know what to do with myself.   Feels like I've got brain fog, when I'm in my flat I don't want to do anything.  But when I'm out and about I don't want to go back to the flat.   Got a week's wages coming in tomorrow and I'm thinking of just flying to somewhere else in the UK without telling anybody.   Fuck it, I'm rambling now.  Going back to sleep (8am). 
I	you?	I have really bad panic attacks when I'm preparing to do something that triggers anxiety, even down to making a phone call or going outside some days.  I've tried breathing and visualization and mantras and nothing helps.  Has anything (something I can do myself in the moment) helped you?
This would be okay except I have a history of  ot living up to my potential	being unmedicated	My boss/mentor has decided that I need tough love.   <e1> This would be okay except I have a history of  ot living up to my potential </e1>  due to  <e2> being unmedicated </e2> .   Currently he is changing my duties and routine to fit his idea of where I 'should' be.  I thrive on routine and being allowed to do what I need to do.   Any suggestions for handling this brand of crazy/constant routine switch until things settle down and he eases up?

Have any of you been annoyed at the *lack* of empathy you received from another ADHD person? I haven't known enough in person to say. 
Where	difference?	Where do you draw the line between having an anxiety problem and experiencing paranoid feelings? I never thought of myself as an anxious person per se.  Maybe someone who worries a lot and has very low self esteem, but I don't have problems interacting with people and I don't have a nervous personality.  But the feelings of mistrust I've had since I was young have been getting worse, and I feel like I've also been falling into some paranoid ways of thinking.    How do you tell the difference? 
Well,	moron.	Well, i know this sounds embarrassing, but im a 23 y/o guy who lives with my parents and has a part-time writing job.  I gave a government service exam recently, and couldnt get through, the latest in a long line of failures.   I was feeling unwell earlier today, so i was lying on the bed in the morning, when my mom entered my room, began kicking and slapping and abusing me, saying that my illness is a sham, and that im just a lazy asshole.  I had decided to take my writing job further, but my mom says that i should just give the exam again, even though i dont want to.  She forced me to do it.   I could try to a)commit suicide or b)move away, though at present, i dont earn enough, and secondly, my culinary skills are subpar.  Some advice would be helpful.  Sorry for sounding like a weak prick,but im still shocked at my mom's horrid behaviour.   Take care, buddies :) Thanks for taking the trouble to read this idiotic post by  a moron.  
he seems nice	I said yes	I've been talking to this guy online and we've exchanged phone numbers and facebook and stuff.  He asked if I wanted to go out tomorrow and  <e1> he seems nice </e1>  so  <e2> I said yes </e2> .  But now I'm really really nervous about what's going to happen.  He seems like a nice, normal guy, maybe a little bit shy like me but idk.  What if he's really different irl? I'm so nervous about meeting new people and I've never done anything like this before.  What if he says or does something that makes me uncomfortable and I don't know how to respond? 
I find myself self medicating with coffee	it has a different effects on me then others	Been working in the trades for about 10 years and am curious how Adderall would show up on drug tests and if most companies are ok with you taking it at work? Was diagnosed with ADHD at like 6 years old, but stopped taking medication to go into the military and made due without it for 15 years, but have wondered if I would preform better on it.   <e1> I find myself self medicating with coffee </e1>  as  <e2>  it has a different effects on me then others </e2>  and I have problems with verbal instructions a lot.  
I definitely want ADHD to be a central part	it affects me a lot	I'm part of a health profession interprofessional arts and humanities certificate, and in about January there's an event where you have to make a piece of art and have an artist's statement about it.    I remembered that there was a great comment about ADHD was living in a rain of post-it notes, and I'm basing that around my concept for my art piece.    In the middle of my piece, it'll be a person studying for some kind of health science exam in the dark, only illuminated by one light.  Around him, I was to stick physical sticky notes about the negative thoughts of having ADHD or tangents that he might drift off onto.   I want /r/ADHD to be a part of this, so I would really like if some of you could record or comment about some tangents that you've had during your day-to-day living, and definitely some negative thoughts that you've had about ADHD.  No names or usernames will be written (unless you want me to).   I'm also open to other art ideas, but  <e1> I definitely want ADHD to be a central part </e1>  since  <e2> it affects me a lot </e2> . 
her parents don't allow to date until she's 16	as of now I can only see her Friday nights when she can go to the mall	Okay so a bit about my relationship.  I'm 17 and she's 15, and  <e1> her parents don't allow to date until she's 16 </e1>  so  <e2> as of now I can only see her Friday nights when she can go to the mall </e2> .  I myself, I think I am a little depressed and I have anxiety.  She has very severe depression and anxiety.  For some reason, I just cannot think well.  Not only am I a socially awkward Weirdo, but I don't know how to help my girlfriend.  I read somewhere that saying it's going to be okay and such actually make things worse and I just don't know how to help her.  I told her I would come pick her up and we can just drive and she said it would only make things worse
Being	wiggles?	Being ADHD combined type means I have way too much mental and physical energy with zero direction.  Meds help. . . but there's just nothing to channel it in.  I have a thousand hobbies but I just can't find a groove. . .  if that makes senses.    any suggestions? anything that words as a more sustainable trick to calming down the ADHD wiggles?
Hi	:/	Hi everyone, I just really need to vent. . . I am applying for grad school and I need to ask some professors for letters of recommendation.  I am a very, very awkward, socially inept, and anxious person, especially in social situations, and so I am not very comfortable with these professors and am dreading having to talk to them (email is not an option either and so I have to ask them in-person).   I have been googling and trying to understand how to ask them and what materials to bring and all that but I still don't really know what to do or how to do this!! I have no friends or people to talk to to get advice about school things and this constant fear, anxiety, and worry over all this is just tearing me apart right now.  I just don't understand why simple things have to be so hard for me :/
I also am coming down with a cold	which usually messes with my anxiety	So, about 4 days ago I started taking magnesium.  I've been taking two 400mg pills a day in a mix of citrate/taurate/malate/glycinate/succinate.  Since I started my anxiety has reduced greatly but for some reason I've developed a minor muscle tick in my right eye.  It's not noticeable by other people, but I can feel it throughout the day off and on.  I'm also feeling some brain fog, but this was present before the magnesium.  I also had some major achey feels in my body, but those have mostly passed.   I'm assuming that this is just my body adjusting to the magnesium (I was most likely extremely deficient), but I'd love some feedback.   <e1> I also am coming down with a cold </e1> ,  <e2> which usually messes with my anxiety </e2> .   I'm also taking: B-complex (special forms of B vitamins because I've got an MTHFR mutation) Omega-3 Vitamin D (5000 iu, I'm recovering from a deficiency) Probiotics  TL;DR: muscle tick and other symptoms from taking magnesium, wondering if I should just wait it out. 
Reddit,	exhaustion?	Reddit, what do you do to keep your energy levels up? Being depressed zaps enough strength already, but pretending that you aren't wishing to be hit by a rouge train all day is even more exhausting.   What do you do, when you're alone, at work, or with your friends to keep yourself from fainting from pure exhaustion? 
What	tomorrow.	What I mean is, you won't always be aware of ADD (or ADHD) until life really starts to challenge you.  I've been in denial of my attention difficulties until now, where my college classes have gotten difficult and its really begun to challenge my attention and motivation.  I used to be able to get by without studying that much, but now I literally have to sit down and study, and I am unable to do it.  The only way I can study is if chug a lot of coffee or an energy drink which clearly indicates a problem.  I'm going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow. 
I have adhd as well as asthma so they kinda cancel each other out	I can't focus on calming down	Hi, so i'm 19 years old and i've recently been diagnosed with anxiety.  I've been dealing with it for about a year now and I don't feel like anything's been changed or improved.  I've tried taking deep breaths and calming down but  <e1> I have adhd as well as asthma so they kinda cancel each other out </e1>  because  <e2> I can't focus on calming down </e2>  and if I hold my breath too long my asthma flares up which increases my anxiety.  So does anyone have any good tips besides deep breaths?
They've lightened up a bit since I've gotten older	I didn't give them a choice	I'm a 22 year old male who's in his last year of college.  But before I get into that, a little back story:  I have been depressed for as long as I can remember.  I was bullied in high school and grew up mostly without friends.  My dad left when I was born, my mother drank and did drugs and abused me (mentally mostly).  I eventually wound up with my grandparents who were so afraid of today's society that they didn't really want me leaving the house without telling them where I was at all times.   <e1> They've lightened up a bit since I've gotten older </e1>  (mostly because  <e2> I didn't give them a choice </e2> )
I've heard people talk about it here	I figured I'd ask	 <e1> I've heard people talk about it here </e1> , so  <e2> I figured I'd ask </e2> .  Anyone know how much genetic testing to see about med efficacies costs? I'm thinking about asking for it as a christmas present: knowing what meds I can take to feel happy is probably going to make me feel much better than a dvd or two.   Do you know what besides med efficacy gets conveyed? Do you get your whole genome data to hold onto and reference when there's a gene you learn about and want to compare? How much information do these things give? Ideally I'd want a copy of my whole genome to reference later, a cancer susceptibility screening, and information on psychiatric drug efficacy.  It'd be cool to know more about my ethnicity/heritage (my mom's adopted), but that's probably the least important element of genetic testing to me right now.   Edit: [This]( reddit. com/r/bipolar/comments/3j41uz/has_anyone_else_had_dna_testing_to_see_which/) post gave me the impression it is available in some form. 
I	stop.	I have been obsessively self harming myself, wither by stabbing myself in the leg with safety pins, pencils or anything sharp that I can get my hands on, I have been tearing off my own skin out of being upset with something, if I try to stop either one of these behaviours I start chewing on the inside of my mouth until I bleed or I start tearing off my toenails.   I don't know how to stop this vicious cycle but I just want it to fucking stop. 
Somebody	com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0.	Somebody should make some kind of software that incorporates all this. . . I'm frankly shocked that nobody has it would work wonders to integrate all these principles into some software:  youtube. com/watch?v=_tpB-B8BXk0.  
I	do?	I don't know if I am depressed.  But for the past few months, nothing has really felt that great.  Before this, I was always carefree and easygoing.  Now I just feel like my life is going nowhere and I am destined to fail.  I don't know why I'm going to college, I can't comfortably talk to my girlfriend anymore, and I feel like I don't have any real friends with little to no hope of actually meeting any new ones.  I try to do things that I think will make me happy but everything just seems so trivial and pointless.  I just feel like I need to leave everything I have and do something else, but I feel like I can't even do that.    What should I do?
I'm ashamed	I smoked as long as I did	My husband and I just put out or last cigarettes.  We have made the decision, for the last time.   Not only is this better for us, but it will help us be better parents to our one year old.  She makes me want to be better, as a person and parent.   <e1> I'm ashamed </e1>   <e2> I smoked as long as I did </e2> .  I smoked while pregnant.  She is now one year old and I am so tired of it.  She shouldn't smell stale smoke on me or her father.  She shouldn't have been born with nicotine in her system.  I am ashamed of the past, but I am going to change the future.    This time is the real deal. 
if they should subside over time	the whole point of this medication was to FIX these symptoms of my ADHD	I'm hoping you guys can tell me if these side effects are normal or expected from this drug, and  <e1> if they should subside over time </e1> . . .  As  <e2> the whole point of this medication was to FIX these symptoms of my ADHD </e2>  - Not amplify them.   It's been almost 6 hours since I took my first dose, and I just resorted to cracking a beer in hopes that it will take the edge off.   Is this normal?  I've read that the side effects can subside after a few days or weeks, but I am concerned none-the-less.   Thanks!
I was completely anxious	a month leading up to the end of school	I'm talking about more anxiety than usual and it's almost always present,  kind of like fog in your head that shifts your perception of the world (generally in a more negative way)   I have been experiencing this prolonged anxiety state sporadically for a few years now and it always deals with the beginning and end of college semesters.     For instance, at the end of last spring semester  <e1> I was completely anxious </e1>  all the time for about  <e2> a month leading up to the end of school </e2>  but a few days after I got home, I was completely fine.    I am now experiencing it as we near the end of fall semester (and by nearing I mean like over a month away still).  I had been dressing this happening again and it finally started today when my professor mentioned that we only had 6 classes left.  Fuck I thought
So	it?	So I've been looking at an ad lately on the train that basically calls out to me.  It says Do you get anxious in social situations? Feel like its difficult to talk to others? Its for a social anxiety study and how they'll give you cognitive behavioral therapy for a few months if you become a test subject.  I've been thinking about trying it for the past few days and even wrote down the email but I'm too scared to reach out to them.  Does anyone have experience with this kind of therapy? Would you recommend it?
I've	30.	I've always had bad teeth mostly attributed to bouts of depression where I could hardly get out of bed.  I got work done after finally getting insurance and I'm starting to realize that my anxiety is even worse than my depression when it comes to dental hygiene.   I've developed good brushing habits over the years after realizing that I can't allow my mental health to destroy me even more.   But damn, I can't stop clenching my teeth.  I realize it throughout the day that my jaw is almost always locked.  I'm clenching my teeth so hard that I get headaches.  It's so persistent that I knocked a porcelain tooth out of its fixture.   Does anyone deal with this? How do you handle this? I've been given a night guard for night to prevent grinding my teeth down to a pulp, which doesn't help me during the rest of the day.  My grandmother mentioned wearing a mouthgaurd throughout the day but that isn't a realistic option.   I hate teeth.  I lost my smile years ago.  But I really want to prevent losing them completely which in this current route I'll be wearing dentures by 30.  
Kind	tell?	Kind of been struggling lately.  I'm not professionally diagnosed, but I find happiness in little, am numbed mostly, and occasionally I struggle with suicidal thoughts.  I feel like I can be reasonable when posting here, although I hate self diagnosing.    Anyway, when did you decide to tell someone? Who was it and why did you tell them specifically? i feel like I need help, but I don't know who to turn to.  I'm usually emotionally distant and uncomfortable with being that vulnerable.  So. . .  Who should I tell?
After	4:00)	After too many months on Ritalin that I didnt want in the first place, I finaly got Elvanse (Europe version of Vyvanse).   Works a lot better, but my focus is WAAAY OFF.  I cant remember why I went upstairs, or to grab something from the freezer 20 secs after my misses asked me too.  Also at work, if distracted from a task I can suddenly 2 hours later come a cross that task and THEN remember I was suppose to have it finished 1 hour ago.   Could this come from too low dosage? Im on 50mg 3.  week at the time.  Max. dose is 70mg, is it possible 70mg would improve my focus problem? Or just that Ritalin was worked better for me on this area than Elvanse? (Ritalin i took 80mg XR + 30mg IR at 4:00)
I'm always very upset with myself	I stopped	I want to be able to run with friends of mine who will run for about 30-45 minute runs.   I feel like I have the physical capability to run for this long but I get bored or just think of a million reasons I don't want to do it.  When I run by myself I go for about 10 minutes before just wanting to stop, even if it doesn't hurt that much.  I just get bored and don't want to run.  Afterwards  <e1> I'm always very upset with myself </e1>  that  <e2> I stopped </e2> .  Has anyone ever overcome a similar problem or have any tips?  **TL;DR: I need help overcoming boredom during long endurance sports like running. **   
Some	it?	Some people have experienced shit loads of pain and have a clear understanding of their situation and should be fucking listened to.   If I died and was a ghost looking down on my corpse, I might see my parents desperately try to revive my dead body and my younger sister cry with hands covering her mouth and it would be heart-breaking to see but I wouldn't try to grant their wish and bring myself back to life.   Me being alive shouldn't have been what made them happy and if it was and they wanted to put so much pressure on me to satisfy them then there would've been no way for me having any way to survive without feeling like I would be doing the wrong thing with my life.   It's probably not their fault that they wanted so much out of me but it's not my fault if I couldn't help them and felt like I had reached my limit dying from overwork and stress.   Why are people so fucking proud holding their stupid stigmas and then complain when the victim kills him/herself and not do anything about it? 
I	luck!	I tried going cold turkey yesterday and ended up needing two beers last night to stop the shaking, sweating, general awful omg-im-about-to-die feeling.  Luckily those were the last two traces of booze in my apartment.  Feeling good this morning and I have A LOT of work for classes so I'm just gonna buckle down and stay busy.  Wish me luck!
I took my first pill of ritalin	I feel an inner calmness	 <e1> I took my first pill of ritalin </e1> ,  <e2> I feel an inner calmness </e2> , like my brain slowed down a bit.  I also want to know if the positive effects increase with time.  I'm feeling a bit desperate, college is killing me, but I refuse to let anything stop me from getting the education and future I want.  
I	hospitalized.	I am afraid of being involuntarily hospitalized. 
So	or?	So newbie to admitting and getting diagnosed with adhd, and little confused to how I should be feeling on adderall. . .     How I feel is, my mind is so much calmer, and rather than jumping from one task to the next.  I am actually able to stop myself and stay on one task.  But I don't feel this great rush of 'get stuff done' that I always heard people got when starting on adderall.  Why is this? and is this normal?  Also, caffeine.  What is the theory on having coffee.  Should I stop, is it screwing with the adderall or? 
I'm panicking	I'm afraid that I'm going to die a virgin with no girlfriend ever	I think I have a prostate infection.  I put my semen on a napkin and a few days later, it was yellowish green.  I also have the ability to blow myself.  I'm not gay but I think it comes from impulse whenever I do it.  Ever since I finished blowing myself, I had a weird itch at the back of my throat.  I don't know what it is, but my anxiety is telling me that it is an STD.   <e1> I'm panicking </e1>  and  <e2> I'm afraid that I'm going to die a virgin with no girlfriend ever </e2> .  I also don't want to tell my parents that I blew myself.  I'm so scared that I gave myself STDs! I don't want to die! Help me please! I need answers!
I dealt with it	I thought it was part of the growing pains	I started out on Zolaft for Anxiety and it was working ok, but when I went up to the regular dose from the half dose my brain felt wrong.  I cant explain it, it was just wrong.  So we decided to switch to Paxil.  I detoxed a week, and started paxil.  Since starting paxil I have had a panic attack or two every single day.  (up from 3-4 a month. ) but  <e1> I dealt with it </e1>  as  <e2> I thought it was part of the growing pains </e2> .  But then last night I took my usually dose, and went to sleep.  4 hours later I woke up abruptly (afraid, like I had a nightmare or something. ) and my eyes were not working.   I blink a few times and it comes rushing back, a mass of blurriness at first focusing down until it was normal.   I also had a bloody nose, which may or not have been related.   Anyone else have this side effect before? What did you do?    TLDR: took paxil, woke up blind for about 10-20 seconds now I can see normal.  What do?
As	out.	As the title says, I just found the most efficient way to clean my house.  When i'm on the phone I fidget like mad and touch random things, rearrange objects and walk around in circles.  So this evening my best friend rang and I decided to tidy my living room.  We talked for 5 hours and now. . .  my kitchen is spick and span, the oven is gleaming, all the laundry is washed, dried, put away, bed made.  Lets put it this way, I haven't seen my floor in months!  Moral of the story is: put your fidgets to good use!  Now I'm going to enjoy a well earned tea and pass out. 
I	too.	I attempted suicide a little under two months ago.  I wholeheartedly intended to die, but I failed.  I hit rock bottom, and took a look at my life.  I decided to try one last time.   And for the first time in my life, I've been getting better.  Two months isn't a long time, but I'm feeling hopeful for the first time in years, and motivated for the first time. . .  ever.   I've been struggling with mental illness for a decade, and things are starting to look up.  They can for you too. 
aparently	emotions	aparently there are people who can actually function with their depression .  such as getting good grades,doing good in their job,not procrastinating.  and i can't help but be jealous of those people.  I can't get my life together and my depression makes me want to not do anything.  Like i know some people fake it till they make it but i can't fake anything.  If i dred doing work i'll avoid it not tackle it.   i'm also jealous of people who are emotionaless.  I myself have periods of being sad out of no where for either the littlest petty reasons or no reason at all.  I cry easily and get my self esteem and pride hurt on a weekly basis.  I'm basically a giant baby.  aparently other people don't have that problem they are just constantly numb and emotionless.  and honeslty i'd rather be constantly emotionless than be on a rollercoaster of high and low emotions
Extremely frustrated	I have to switch meds again after being on Wellbutrin for months	 <e1> Extremely frustrated </e1>  that  <e2> I have to switch meds again after being on Wellbutrin for months </e2> .  I wish ADHD meds didn't have so many side effects.  Anyone have similar experiences?
I	guys.	I just started on adderall and I'm the inattentive type without the hyperactivity.   I have always been a laid-back chill guy and since I started taking it, it gives me a boost of energy (of course it's basically speed).   But I also know the hyperactive types that calm down a lot.   I'm guessing both types get improved focus, which it's doing for me that's priceless.    Just curious if that seems true for you guys.  
I stopped for a long time	I was embarrassed to be taking a Ritalin based drug	So I used to take Concerta when I was a kid.   <e1> I stopped for a long time </e1>  because  <e2> I was embarrassed to be taking a Ritalin based drug </e2> .  Now I'm 24 and I started a new regimen of Adderall XR.  I know it isn't uncommon to feel anxiety as a side effect, especially when you first start on it.  The thing is my mom just got breast cancer.  She is fighting it and there is a very high chance of beating it.  However this situation has made me face my own mortality.  I can usually cope with realizing we all die some day.  However I am wondering if the anxiety I am getting later on the day over it is related to the Adderall wearing off.  Normally I am very laid back, but I will start to fixate on it and get really doomy and lost in my own head.  How do you guys deal with anxiety and will this pass?
There	strangers	There is no cure. . .  Just painful to exist.  Alone, and without a purpose.    Everyday I struggle to live alone and stay alive.  Why bother when you will never be ok in the end?  Note I am a registered S/O.  I was arrested at 13.  I am 32 now.  Never hurt a fly.  Got busted for literally fingerbanging my victim.  (arrested for the 2 year law).    Fast forward.  Have my own kid (id never hurt)&gt; But I distance myself from her (For the obvious reasons).  It sucks.    I feel like I cant connect with people.  Like I cant date a woman, or raise a child.  I can't get a job anywhere, I cant vote, I cant move about the country freely without bringing up a mistake I made literally 20 years ago.   Even though it was a one time event, the permanent damage its caused to me Mentally Is always going to be there.    I didn't have a child hood that was normal.  I've been threatened by strangers

I'm terrified about it	it's making me feel like I'm becoming a monster	I'm terrified.  ASD/Anxiety disorder sufferer here and I've been having absolutely horrific thoughts about recent world events that are a complete contrast to my beliefs.   <e1> I'm terrified about it </e1>  and  <e2> it's making me feel like I'm becoming a monster </e2> .  I think I'm just anxious about it but I get these thoughts and then my mind freaks out, and I start screaming into myself that these thoughts need to go away. 
I	way.	I hate it.  Sometimes I feel just fine and think I'm about to become better but then badump, I meet someone and realize I still can't say anything without showing how insecure I am and I don't have any confidence in myself.  It's like a flip switch.  I can't stand it and I feel like everyone takes me the wrong way. 
Hi	friends	Hi everyone,  My son is 7 yo and was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago.  One major aspect is the impact on his social life.  I found him so many times crying over the fact that he has no friends and that the other kids don't want to play with him.  To be fair, he is probably very difficult to have around: he nags a lot, disrupts games, tends to barge in on people and try and give instructions.  He is very loud and aggressive when things don't go his way.  As a result, kids tend to be very harsh with him.  He has a group of friends
30	YOU!!.	30 days today! 1month! Got my Star! Struggling but will make it! Just wanted to say thank you for all your support and positive thoughts, don't know that I would have made it this far without this thread! You guys are awesome! When I'm in my down and depressed moments I read these posts and threads and it's very encouraging that I CAN DO THIS!! SO THANK YOU!!.

First	advice?	First time poster.  I am a F(20) in college,  have dealt with anxiety for a long time but was never willing to admit it until the diagnosis.  On Monday I start Zoloft, and doctor recommended counseling sometime soon.   I have never taken medication for mental issues and I am anxious and a little bit scared.  I am already taking 3 medications for physical issues, it's not taking the medication that bothers me.  I think it mostly bothers me that I was not able to take care of this myself, and that I have to admit I need help.    Has anyone else had to deal with this? Any advice?  
I	post	I don't give a fuck about my IQ.  It means nothing if I can't even get out of bed.  Don't fucking try making me feel guilty about being depressed and being smart.    Yeah I'm an asshole for bragging about my fucking IQ.  I'm just a waste of this potential you speak of.  I wish someone else who wants to live could have this so that everybody would stop guilt tripping me about being so smart.    Sorry about this post
I'm posting on r/addiction	he said something along the lines of it feels terrible to be sober	so my roommate has just begun taking buprpion for depression.  he told me his doctor told him drinking was ok as long as he didnt drink with the bupropion in his system.  After I got him to calm down and got him food he has not had any issues.  so far he seems like he is fine but idk how long that will last.   <e1> I'm posting on r/addiction </e1>  because  <e2> he said something along the lines of it feels terrible to be sober </e2> .  Does anybody have experience with this stuff or addictions in general that can shed some light? I've dealt with overdoses before and can handle that before it comes to it.  I took his pills from him because he took more than prescribed. (3 today
I've	worsen.	I've been taking 40 mg of Vyvanse for about 3 weeks now and I was just wondering if anyone else, who is or has taken it, feels certain side effects.   For the most part, I love that I can focus more and have more energy; however, I've been feeling nauseated and even a bit loopy and confused for some of the time.   I've become more forgetful and kind of in a haze of sorts.   My doctor suggested increasing my dose to 60 mg but i'm scared that my side effects will worsen.  
I	me	I recently graduated high school and am currently about to graduate beauty school I used to have a decent amount of friends and we would hang out and have fun but ever since high school ended I don't have any of my old friends and the girls at my beauty school are immature and annoying and talk behind each other's backs I feel like I always reach out to other girls to hang out if I don't reach out they won't talk to me I don't know what's wrong with me I feel like I'm a burden on everyone I would give anything to have a few girl friends who text me and ask me to hang out or just text me first in general I'm so lonely and miserable I've recently started cutting myself I just wish someone cared about me
I've	hey	I've heard that these help calm you down and are relaxing so, I went and purchased one from Barnes &amp; Noble the other day and oddly enough, it helps clear my mind and calm me down.  I find myself just zoning out, listening to podcasts while I'm doing it and I'm like; Oh hey
She told me that my dose will be increased over time	my symptoms are severe	I have not been formally diagnosed yet, I have filled out several diagnostic assessment forms and sent them to the clinic after being referred and the specialist agreed to see me.  Tomorrow I will be going in for a 2 hour assessment.  My question is, how should I approach the situation? should I write a some things down to make sure I cover everything or should I just let her ask the questions and answer them as best as I can?   Am I allowed to suggest certain medications/combinations of meds or should I keep my mouth shut?   UPDATE: I went in for my assessment yesterday and a final diagnosis was confirmed.  My doctor will be starting me on Concerta 18mg next week or so.   <e1> She told me that my dose will be increased over time </e1>  as  <e2> my symptoms are severe </e2> .  Also, Vyvanse is used as a second line of treatment, so in the event that Concerta does not do the job, she will put me on Vyvanse.  Does anyone have any experience with Concerta, if so, do you have any tips or information that I may find useful? Your input is greatly appreciated!
Hi	reading.	Hi friends.  I'm stepping up, once again, and deciding to make a change in my life.  I'm tired of being hungover, tired of being ashamed of the previous night, and most importantly tired of the lack of control of my life.  Fortunately I haven't lost anything or ruined relationships as a result of my drinking habits.  Each time I clear my head for a few days I am so grateful to think that I haven't managed to do that.  I know that my drinking habits will one day progress and very well lead to just that.  So I decided this past Sunday morning (while sober) to step up and make this change.  I'm looking to this group for any support and advice that any of you might share.   Thanks for reading.  
I'm	1:00	I'm crying right now.  Even though there are people around, I hide it very well - nobody can see that I cry.    Lame topic.  Nothing much to say, I just needed to 'say' something, *anything*  This is what I'm listening to:  youtube. com/watch?v=WE-8letU8VA  EDIT: what I listen to now  youtube. com/watch?v=Wqcxx5Lk52c favorite song of my first love.  She played the beginning for me on the piano.  Those were hard times but at least we had the innocence of youth.  I didn't know that world is so much fucked up  EDIT 2:  youtube. com/watch?v=xY_qU0sGX1g the beginning is shitty, the real song begins at 2:00. . . great cover of a legendary song.  Little bit sad but also beautiful  EDIT 3:  youtube. com/watch?v=k1-TrAvp_xs Lacrimosa means tear in latin.  Mozart only composed the music up until 1:00
I'm really good at hiding and suppressing my anxiety	I live by myself	I've been living with crippling anxiety since I was a young teenager, I'm 22 now.   I have no idea how to go about it, do I just make an appointment with a gp, explain my situation and go from there?  <e1> I'm really good at hiding and suppressing my anxiety </e1>  because  <e2> I live by myself </e2>  and need to be a functional person in order to put a roof over my head, but from the inside it feels like hell all the time.   I'm afraid the doctor will think I'm lying in order to get pills, is this fear unfounded? I'm in Canada if that makes any difference.   Thanks for reading.  
I take my prescribed medication	I feel more alerted calm down and be able to sit down during the meals with my friends	I forgot to take it on weekend, and I had no motivation and did not know how to plan and socially awkward for awhile.    When  <e1> I take my prescribed medication </e1> ,  <e2> I feel more alerted calm down and be able to sit down during the meals with my friends </e2> .    I started Adderall this August.   I am glad I decided to see MD.  I am still trying to get psychiatrist for my insurance. 
I	?	I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and was put on Ritalin.  Now I didn't feel much bad before I was diagnosed.  I was distracted and had attention problems but I liked overthinking and thinking differently and fast.    It was college which made me realize I had it .  I was wondering how important is it to continue on medication on a regular basis ?   Is it okay to take it only when I study or am doing something which makes me feel like I require it ? Or no matter what I should constantly keep taking it ?    In the start I know its important to take it so your body can get used to it, but how about taking it only when I think its required say an year from being put on medication  ?    
I	know.	I recently was given some samples of Serequil by my doctor and was wondering if anyone else has had severely increased suicidal thoughts after taking it.   I'm experiencing this along with shakiness and generally increased anxiety.   Anyone else experiencing this?  It could be my depression worsening like it has for the past few months or the meds, I just don't know. 
I	6	I was on a combination of lamictal, Wellbutrin,and trazodone for a while.  I lost so much weight.  Last May I weight 184, I had been on Olanzipine for five years.  Then I got off in May, I was slowly loosing weight over the summer.  Than my depression got worse. . . . . .  Then my weight completely dropped.  However this was also due to me being on Trazodone.  Mainly cause it made me feel sick every time I even thought of good or certain things.  I had lost all my hunger and my thirst.   I went from 166 at the end of August to about 151 beginning of October.  Then I got on welbutrin and now I'm down to 122.  And I am 5' 6 
I'm	work.	I'm a 27 year old man and all I do is cry anymore, over the most stupid things and sometimes just out of nowhere.   I haven't been happy in 5 years. . . . I just wanna be happy.   Even now ,writing this, I'm crying. . . . I just want to be happy like I used to be.   Nothing seems to work. 
Recently	disappear.	Recently I've suffered with a constant overwhelming panic - I'm a Brit in the U. S.  And about to take a Megabus with my girlfriend.  She is tall and beautiful and draws attention everywhere she goes.    Before the bus I'm going to lunch with her family.  I don't cry, generally, but this is too much.  My whole body is fizzing and it's taking all My energy not to just run away right now.  I have suicidal ideation type thoughts but I don't feel I would ever act on them - they are intrusive and appear as an option 'out' I think.  One I wouldn't take.   I just want to disappear. 
She pitched a fit at Thanksgiving dinner	I dared to sit at the foot of the table - her spot - even though my aunt assigned me that place and told her so	Hello all.  I am new to this subreddit, and I am looking for some support.  I am 21 and on zoloft, diagnosed with anxiety and clinical depression.  I have been in counseling for 1. 5 years, but my old counselor retired and I have recently switched to one I don't click with as well.   My mother is an alcoholic.  She drinks almost every day, and I can't remember a day when she hasn't been drunk.  When she drinks, she is highly critical (e. g.  What do you have to be depressed about?) and can even be terribly mean (e. g.   <e1> She pitched a fit at Thanksgiving dinner </e1>  because  <e2> I dared to sit at the foot of the table - her spot - even though my aunt assigned me that place and told her so </e2> . )  I can't keep alcohol in the house
Hey man, we can not feel heartrate! And boom again	I am super aware	Hey guys I used to suffer from severe heart anxiety.  I am just really curious.  I am doing good with coping with my anxiety.  Have not had panic attacks for days.  I feel like I am on the borderline of my anxiety and normal perception of my body.  To be specific, there is time I am in the gym working out with my friend, talking.  Really not minding my heartrate, but suddenly my body alerts me:  <e1> Hey man, we can not feel heartrate! And boom again </e1> ,  <e2> I am super aware </e2> .  It feels like my body always goes in to the anxious state immediately when I do not focus a bit on my heart rate .  I am getting really tired, still doing my best but I would like to hear your tips, advice stories.  How can I force my mind and body to accept that and focus fully on my life.  
I don't know how to deal with even simple things	I avoid doing anything	I have generalized anxiety and an extremely avoidant personality (not answering calls, responding to emails etc.  ).  Part of the reason I run away from everything is extremely poor cognition.   <e1> I don't know how to deal with even simple things  </e1> so so  <e2> I avoid doing anything </e2> .  I feel like my brain is clogged all the time and I cannot put pieces of information together to make sense of them.    Now I'm not sure if the  anxiety is causing this brain fog or if its something entirely unrelated.  I'm curious to know if anyone else has/had brain fog and if it went away/persisted when the anxiety was treated.    Thanks!    
I'm	stop.	I'm very quickly getting hypomanic and showing signs that it'll escalate into mania.  I'm exhausting my roommate with my rapid speech, I'm drinking alone, I'm confused and I'm wandering at night without a jacket.  After an episode last month, I'm painfully self-aware, but I can't stop any of my habits.  I couldn't make myself take my medication last night.  If I have a manic or depressive episode, I might have to leave college (I'd rather die, honestly).  I am intensely angry and it feels directionless but it's probably at myself for feeding my hypomania.  I just can't stop.  If I tell my therapist or psychiatrist, there will be consequences, and if I tell my friends too much, there will be consequences.  Everybody thinks I'm crazy and I'm reinforcing that, but I can't give up this feeling.  It's not that I don't want to - it's like there's a disconnect between my mind and my actions.  I can't stop. 
I have some actual health issues and weak body in general	i listen to my body signals very carefully	Hello, I am hypochondriac and i need some advice.  I know that i should go into therapy, but i dont have the money for it.  There is a lot of anxiety in my life thats related to my health.   <e1> I have some actual health issues and weak body in general </e1> , so  <e2> i listen to my body signals very carefully </e2> .  Lately it really gives me a lot of anxiety.  For example, yesterday i started to feel some mild pain in right part of my chest.  So, i immediately started to think about cancer and tuberculosis.  Its just one example of million worries that i have in my life on regular basis.  How to resolve this? Is it because im afraid of death? How to stop caring i you live or die? I want to live without anxiety like a lot of my friends. 
my lowered GPA	I will never get an internship at a major company who will help pay for my college education in exchange for my eventual usefulness as a worker	I am in my freshmen year of college at IVY Tech and I am apparently too lazy to write a fucking research paper for my World Civilization I class.  This means my GPA will take another dip and I will never be able to get into IUPUI to get my chemistry major.  Also because of  <e1> my lowered GPA </e1> ,  <e2> I will never get an internship at a major company who will help pay for my college education in exchange for my eventual usefulness as a worker </e2> .  I will never be able to work in a chemistry lab and will probably just become a hobo who has no hope of ever living his dreams.  I will be sad and alone and unloved and a waste of space to anyone who would help me.  Why should I even try.  Why.  
Been	here.	Been depressed for going on two weeks now.  Been sleeping TONS, not eating, random spells of crying, feeling worthless.  You know, the usual depression symptoms.  I try every coping skill I can think of.  I force myself to go to the gym even though I have zero energy, I force myself to eat even if it's a few bites, I read, I journal, I even force myself to go out with people and I'm still fucking ridiculously miserable.  What are my other options? I talked to my pdoc about maybe changing my meds, which he did.  Still nothing.  No change.  I'm not suicidal if that helps any.  I'm just running out of ideas here. 
my gf works a super long shift that ends late	the urge to kill time with video games and beer is still there and strong	I posted here a week or 2 ago for advice about my first AA meeting, since then I haven't drank at all, and hadn't for a few days before that, so it's probably been 12 days that I have gone without drinking.  With my job I get 2 days off in a row, and  <e1> my gf works a super long shift that ends late </e1> , so  <e2> the urge to kill time with video games and beer is still there and strong </e2> .  But, it seems to be getting a little easier, I have a long road ahead but it's going well.  I'm glad I can come here any time of the day or night (as opposed to AA) and see that there are other people doing it too.  It's encouraging.  
I'm too anxious	tell anyone I'm gay, or that I'm depressed	So. . .  Why bother? I'm a mess socially, I have debilitating anxiety disorders, and very little ambition.  The only real goal I have in my life right now is to maintain my GPA and it feels so hollow I can't find any joy in it.  I have nothing to look forward to, wouldn't the most effective solution to my problems be death? My life is an endless cycle of school, mindless gaming, and sleep.   <e1> I'm too anxious </e1>  to  <e2> tell anyone I'm gay, or that I'm depressed </e2> , hell its not like anyone would care anyway since I don't trust or confide in anyone.  It's just a matter of finding a painless and convenient method of death, and I'm okay with that. 
Hi	moment?	Hi everyone.  I just came across this sub, and I wanted to ask you a question - both for my benefit and hopefully whoever might see this later.   What do you do in the moment that your frustration/tiredness/discontent turns into that flash of anger? You know the moment; the lump of bile in your chest, the adrenaline demanding you act, your tunnel-vision kicking in. . .   So what do you do in the moment, that split-second when it's hard not to just *react*? I had a moment like that today over a relatively small inconvenience.  I have moments like that pretty often, if I'm honest.   So, tl;dr: what are your tips and tricks to stop yourself from reacting in anger in that one incendiary moment?
Adderall has seemed a godsend for many people with ADHD	I am curious as to various feelings on the drug	I have not been on medication for quite a few years.  I have done pretty well without it, but sometimes think about trying it again.  I remember a long long time ago when my mother and I were trying different medications that Adderall made me feel really weird.  I can no longer remember just why I felt off but I will always remember not liking it.  After that, I refused to use any form of Adderall.   <e1> Adderall has seemed a godsend for many people with ADHD </e1>  so  <e2> I am curious as to various feelings on the drug </e2> . 
25	.	25 m here, I have been smoking a pack each day for the last three years, I really really enjoy smoking just like everyone who smokes I like it. .  But not as much as my desire to smoke I like to stop smoking and it's been on my mind for the last month. .  What I am afraid of is that after stopping smoking I start again. .  i need some educational videos and advice. .  I will thank you if you helped me. .  
I'm	different.	I'm having trouble explaining this to my mother, who seems to think that if i'm studying from home, then I can do chores during my breaks.    How can I explain that even if I'm not focusing on study material, cleaning/doing laundry/whatever does not count as a break, and that I need to spend more time after this to actually be able to sit down again.   During my actual breaks I usually go outside/practice juggling while listening to music.  This somehow does count as a break, but I can't explain why its different.  
I'm happy	be sober	Hi! Just introducing myself.  I've browsed here for over a year but never participated.  I completed a 28 inpatient program at Hazelden Betty Ford and I'm now 38 days sober.  I just requested a badge.  I nearly drank myself to death.  I'm 34 yo, 5'0, 103lbs and I was drinking 750ml vodka per day.  Yuck!  <e1> I'm happy </e1>  to  <e2> be sober </e2>  now and I hope to contribute positively. 
The doctor though said I might be on this for *a year*	scares me	I drank too much and now am experiencing post-acute alcohol withdrawal.  I went to the doctor today and he prescribed escitalopram (Lexapro) but I'm really worried about starting.   Background: 6 months of drinking about the equivalent of a bottle of wine a night (more on weekends, less on week days).   I basically want something to help me with the anxiety and panic attacks while recovering from the withdrawal, which could be months, and then hopefully get back to normal.   <e1> The doctor though said I might be on this for *a year* </e1> , and that  <e2> scares me </e2> , a whole year of medication to fix this chemical imbalance
I	despair	I was diagnosed a year ago.  In therapy (started recently) and medicated.  Recently I had a terrible backside.  Dissociated really bad.  Fought with my husband for days.  Now he says my mental inconsistency is more than he can take.  That he thought if he was patient I could get better, be fixed.  But he is taking it is futile.  We are on a break while he figures things out.  I'm slipping further into hopeless despair
I	OK	I have done SO GOOD this semester.  Hell, all three of the semesters since I returned to college.  Then I got sick last week.  No biggie, classes were just reviews for the finals.  But I got the procrastination bug BIG TIME.   In 33 hours, the first of my finals starts - and I am NOT prepared.  I haven't cracked my textbook.  I haven't looked at my study guide.  Thursday I've got another final, and with THAT class I haven't cracked the textbook ALL SEMESTER.   (that's the teacher's fault, she never used it in class but told us last week our whole final will be on its contents)  I am overwhelmed, and when I'm overwhelmed I shut down.    I also realized this afternoon that I have THREE outstanding assignments that need to be done by 11:59pm tomorrow.   So what am I doing? I'm on Reddit of course! I suppose my writing posts can be considered warming myself up for the essays and reviews that I need to write.  Earlier today I was reading and I said to myself, OK
I	tomorrow.	I was just diagnosed with ADHD and I was prescribed Concerta 18mg and Effexor XR 37. 5mg (to help my depression and anxiety).  I've had a rocky ten years off and on anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, etc with no luck of relief.  Now I'm trying a stimulant, my new current Doctor is convinced I had ADHD but worried I might actually not and I'm going to be a fucking tweeker tomorrow.  
I	know?	I messed up again.  I just want to be held tightly, to feel safe.  Does anyone else get that intense desperation to be hugged and held safe? I feel so fragile and out of control sometimes.  Often the sense of sadness and hopelessness that overcomes me feels similar to grief? Like I'm grieving a loss - except, there is no true loss.  But the fear of abandonment, of aloneness, is so profound that I may as well have suffered a loss.  You know?
thats not going to happen	I couldn't handle being away from her for a semester	I'm feeling the heat from finals, and I broke her heart.    I feel like such a piece of shit, I really wanted to be with her until the end but  <e1> thats not going to happen </e1>  now because  <e2> I couldn't handle being away from her for a semester </e2> .    She's open to trying to make it work but I know damn well that its never going to be the same.  I thought about ramming my car into a wall or jumping off a bridge.  I'm not sleeping, hardly eating and can't make up my mind how I feel.    I need help! 
long	)	long story short, I cant tolerate stimulants like adderall. . . . . . . . anyone get any results from wellbutrin? (Im also severly depressed so im hoping it helps there too. )
I'm	opinions.	I'm just curious, if anyone has bad or varying (good and bad) grades, when this started.  I recently saw someone saying it was only in college for them, but I remember failing classes as early as 5th grade and having homework troubles in second grade.  And then of course never having this improve all the way to university.  Looking back I'm a little surprised that the fact that I was failing easy middle school classes didn't ring any alarms for my teachers or anyone.    And apparently the earlier your grade trouble with ADHD, the less intelligent you likely are? This is what I've seen around forums.  I don't really have an opinion about this but I am curious about others' opinions. 
Hey	so	Hey so,  thanks to people like you ladies and gentlemen I am 10 years clean and sober today.   For those curious about how this was done and those who are new I'll explain as follows:  I had about 3 attempts in AA and NA, mainly just attending meetings and stuff but that alone didn't work.  It wasn't until I got tired of relapsing and got super desperate that I got a good sponsor and went through the clear cut directions showing how we recovered -pg 29 in the book 'Alcoholics Anonymous' that everything changed for me and I started to experience a recovery that was really enjoyable with happiness and other cool stuff.   The main thing today that keeps me sober is continuing to work the steps and help others to work the steps through sponsorship.   Even so
3:14	all.	3:14 AM Saturday morning.   The baby was stirring on the monitor.   I peaked open my eyes.  My immediate reaction was to see how my head felt.   How hungover am I from Friday night wine?  Not at all! I didn't drink last night.   Baby went back to sleep.  So did I.   A solid, heavy sleep.   6:59 AM Saturday morning.   Peaked open my eyes.   My reaction was to see how I felt.  Am I hungover?  Nope I didn't drink last night.   And I will not drink today!  Much love to you all.  
My	medicated.	My son is 8 and has severe emotional meltdowns.  He is now receiving more services at school to manage his focus at school.  But that means that he is an absolute mess at home.  I am at my wits end.  Almost anything can trigger a meltdown.  He is now at the age where he could hurt someone or break things with his strength when he hits, throws and slams things in his tantrum.   This is a huge change in amount of what he used to have.  He used to melt down once or twice a week.  Now every day there are several.  Most last from 20 minutes to an hour.    Does anyone have any ideas on how to manage them? I am at a point that I seriously don't know how to help him.  He just cannot seem to get ahold of his emotions at all.  Is there anything I can do to help?  Also, no he is not currently medicated.  
I'm just curious about this problem for the sake of choosing medication	I hear that some ADHD medications are better for specific problems in particular subtypes of ADHD	This mainly has to do with work-oriented stuff, not emotions, social situations, etc. .   I have ADHD-C and was wondering whether or not my impulsivity and hyperactivity symptoms depend on my inattention symptoms.  I mean, if I'm doing something that I enjoy then I will be less likely to suffer from fidgeting and mental (and as a result, physical) stress/pain.  I will also be less likely to make silly mistakes and will be less likely to jump topics as frequently.    *If you take away inattention problems (e. g.  getting bored very, very easily), then should hyperactivity (mainly) and impulsivity go away as well?  <e1> I'm just curious about this problem for the sake of choosing medication </e1> , as  <e2> I hear that some ADHD medications are better for specific problems in particular subtypes of ADHD </e2> . **
Maybe 6 or 7 months ago I started to take medication	I couldn't take the physical	So. .  I have been dealing with Manic depression obviously my whole life. .   <e1> Maybe 6 or 7 months ago I started to take medication </e1>  because  <e2> I couldn't take the physical </e2>  and mental abuse I gave my self.  Since then things have been okay.  Moods were stable meaning I'm usually happy but when my mood plummets I literally dig my self a hole. .  Insomnia/panic/anxiety
It's 5 am here I'm in the process of dropping most of my courses	this stpud depression	 <e1> It's 5 am here I'm in the process of dropping most of my courses </e1>  because of  <e2> this stpud depression </e2>  and tonight I feel so alone and like such a failure I'm just sobbing wondering why so many bad things ha e happened this hear.  I've lost my best friend I had an old best friend and ex basically ruin my life while I had been happy for a few months I moved to a new city thinking it would be really good and its all shit.  I hate my life.  I hate myself so so much guys.  I'm a failure.  Everyone I get close to leaves me.  I don't understand.  Please help me.  Someone talk to me please. 
Kind	:)	Kind of an update from my last post a few weeks ago about showing my mom my grades and shit.   I've raised English and Spanish by about 5 points (English was a 70 now it's 74) (Spanish was a 64ish and now it's 69) Astronomy I raised by like . 50 (It was 69. 02 and now it's 69. 52) But my art class fell :( (was an 89 now it's 87)  Spanish and Astronomy I'm barely failing, if I pass my finals on them tommorow I may be lucky and pass with D's.  If I get a high A on the finals in them I may get a C (which my mom really wants me to get) English will be easy and so will art.  I think I actually saved my grades!! :)   EDIT: I failed my Spanish EOC so I failed Spanish.  So instead of being mad and sulking about it, I'm going to keep reviewing and practicing it over winter break for next semester when I take it again :)
Obsessions, compulsions, and perfectionism create a set of rigid guidelines	cause me much anguish	I, like many people here, search for ways to combat ocd.  CBT, ADT, ssri meds, meditation, exercise, prayer, and weed to name some.  I have been on a journey this year trying to learn more about ocd / depression and it's effect on bad habits, lost time, poor discipline, low motivation, fixed mindsets, lost relationships or any other quality of life impacts.  There have been good times and bad but overall I'm happy.  I try to take a balanced approach to learning all these areas and through trial and error what works for me.   All this leads to my main point.  Break your own rules.  I was watching an arnold schwarzenegger motivation video and he talked about breaking societal rules to be successful.  I started looking at how I live my life by a set of rules created by ocd.   <e1> Obsessions, compulsions, and perfectionism create a set of rigid guidelines </e1>  that  <e2> cause me much anguish </e2> .  This creates only one way to do things with often repetitive time consuming loops.  I started breaking my own rules and it felt much easier to ignore obsessions and stop compulsions.  I thought I would share this little triumph. 
I guess she thinks I don't have ADHD	she wants to lower my dosage of Adderall even though I've been feeling worse lately with my new job	I had to start seeing a new psychiatrist recently since I moved to a new area and I felt like our first session had a weird disconnect. . .   She kept asking me if I felt like my mind worked like a motor? I had no idea what that meant so rephrased it in my own way.  Which apparently wasn't good enough and she just repeated the motor thing again.   This went on for two more times until she acted all frustrated and gave up.    <e1> I guess she thinks I don't have ADHD </e1>  now, since  <e2> she wants to lower my dosage of Adderall even though I've been feeling worse lately with my new job </e2> .   Do any of you feel this way? What on earth does this even mean???
I	anxiety.	I am wondering if this is possible or if I am just crazy.  Whenever I am feeling particularly anxious, I clean my entire like a psycho.  Like I scrub EVERYTHING down and look for stuff that is dirty so I can clean it.  It calms me and helps me work through a panic attack.  Last time I had a big panic attack, I was up at 6 am scrubbing the floor, doing dishes, washing all the laundry, etc.   I also have to double or triple check that I have my keys every time I get out of my car (even if I JUST put them in my purse or pocket) and sometimes at work I obsess that I left something on at home (coffee pot, curling iron, etc).  I've actually gone back home to check that everything was turned off before.   So my question is, does this sound like OCD? I saw a therapist for a while and she assessed that I have obsessive tendencies.  I am wondering if this is a separate issue or if it's possible to have OCD as a side effect of anxiety. 
Those	else.	Those days, not the darkest, but in some ways to hardest to bear.  Can't do anything but can't sit still.  Nothing brings any relief.  Life is completely empty of all joy.    In the past I would comfort eat but I don't want to ruin one of the few positives in my life at the moment, my weight loss.  Getting drunk or high isn't really an option either.   Is there anything that helps you grind through the hours? Even if it doesn't help me it might help someone else.   
i	driving?	i noticed somewhere while trying to apply for a certain job (i forgot where) that having been diagnosed with ADHD is a disqualifier for that position.   my question is can having adhd disqualify you from certain jobs?  like truck driving?
Feeling	apathy.	Feeling low.   Feeling sick to my stomach.   Feeling like a lock without a key.  Well, no.   Feeling like a lock with a key held by all the people who have ever turned their back to me.   By all of my failures.     It's funny how badly I can want to live and die at the same time.   How the future I desperately want seems so damn out of reach.   I feel like I've reached a wall and nothing I do will get me over it.   Medicine? on it.   I'm even in a formal treatment program.     I'm sitting next to the person I most desperately want to hold and comfort me and feel no love or support.   I just feel empty and numb and alone and don't know what to do.   It's not even the depression that hurts the most.   It's the apathy.  
my friends are assholes who are ignoring me	I'm being clingy	I am slowly becoming an overconfident douche, I hate myself, I hate my girlfriend but she's too nice for me to break it too her,  <e1> my friends are assholes who are ignoring me </e1>  because  <e2> I'm being clingy </e2> , I hate my parents and I wish my mother was dead even though she cares about me, I have nothing else to do but play video games and even that is getting boring and it is making me fat, I hate myself.  I am often having fits where I can't really control what I'm doing I just run around and scream.  I want it to end. 
Sorry	bullying	Sorry for potato English everyone.  Long story short.  1 year ago i found on the street very little, very cute and very ill kitty.  I take him to vet doctor, and after vet I bring him to my home.  After month of med threatment and feeding he grow into handsome little gentleman.  I was more dog person before this, but i fell in love in this little creature and he probably loves me as much as i love him.  Two month forward: my gf of 1. 5 years confessed than she cheated on me 6 month ago.  I would kill myself this day, but i got a cat to feed in the evening.  5 month forward and i decide to left my low paid high responsibility job where i was bullied everyday by my boss and my parents sayd something like you lying about bullying
I've	myself	I've been barely hanging on for a while.  I tried to kill myself in August but the bleeding stopped.  I have had some okay days but no good days.   I have been trying my hardest to keep on keeping on, but some days are just so bad.  So bad.  Sometimes I can't keep from saying something and I slip up, I stop pretending to be happy and I say things, stupid things, like I want to hurt myself or I want to kill myself.  I have said them at work to coworkers but mostly to myself
Earlier	Cheers.	Earlier post here:  reddit. com/r/alcoholism/comments/3wwn28/seeking_guidance_to_help_my_brother/  tl; dr - Brother came down from a week long binge hard, I got him checked into detox in the ER.   He spent three days there, came out today.   I was not there when they released him, and when I finally found him he was in a really bad state.   Stumbling, slurring his speech, forgetting things that he said ten minutes ago.   He claims that they pumped him full of Valium and/or Benzo when they discharged him.   Having a hard time with:  A) They discharged him normally in such an impaired state.  B) He's showing all the signs of being drunk except for the smell.   Wondering if there is any possibility that he is telling the truth?  That these drugs can create those sorts of effects?  Or else I imagine he checked himself out against their wishes, climbed back in the bottle and then called for help when it started getting serious.   If he has been drinking, I'm rather concerned about possible side effects of alcohol withdrawal drugs and alcohol mixed.   Watching his breathing now, he's crashed.   Cheers. 
Just	me.	Just threw my wallet down the incinerator chute in my apartment. . .  The trash bag was in my other hand. . .    Fuck me.  
so.	struggling.	so. . . a bit of context, my mom is on anti-depressant medication but overall there is not a history of mental health issues in my family.   i've always considered myself to be an upbeat, happy, extroverted person and when i'm feeling down a few beers, some weight lifting, a funny video or hanging out with friends is all i need to get myself out of the funk. . . but. . .  maybe it's not enough right now.   the pandemic has thrown me off, i struggle to sleep; i worry about my social life and my work; i don't seem to be able to shut off the stress of the day.   i don't think i'm depressed, but sometimes when i'm really down i'll take depression quizzes and it indicates. . . . severe depression.     i thought maybe once i got my second vaccine shot everything would feel normal again, but i don't think it has helped.   i don't feel suicidal, but i constantly feel worn out and lonely in the morning, especially when i wake up in the morning.   am i depressed or is this just some sort of normal mental funk from the pandemic?  what should i do?  i don't feel like i have  mental issue but i'm struggling. 
i	lol	i just spent 8 hours on a roadtrip through the mountains.  as i drove i continuously found myself thinking how easy it would be to just go over the edge.  i've always thought if i were to end my own life it would be a handful of pills and drive off a mountain road, but i'm definitely not suicidal at this point in my life.  but as i thought it while driving i kept going back and forth with myself on whether it was a normal thought or not.  i know anxiety on a mountain drive is normal like oh, shit, i could go over this mountain.  but these weren't anxious thoughts, they were just calming yes, this would be the way thoughts.  uhm. . . so normal or i should be concerned? lol
i am always sad </e1> , <e2> i don't have interest in anything but used to like anime a lot but now don't have any motivation at all.   i just want to lie on my bed all the time and just think how bad i m .  my college entrance exams are in few days but i haven't prepared at all and nor did i learnt anything in my school as well as i didnt had any desire to do anything.  i always thinks how good it would be if i just died and think that suicide would be painful so if i just disappear from existence.   when i get really sad or am about to cry i suddenly gets goosebumps and starts thinking wow how amazing this emotion is and am sometimes think about how interesting my response would be to something much more sad happening like someone close to me dying but then i suddenly think what the he'll am i thinking.  i don't know what is wrong with me  <e1> but i sometime am happy that i m sad	i don't have interest in anything but used to like anime a lot but now don't have any motivation at all.   i just want to lie on my bed all the time and just think how bad i m .  my college entrance exams are in few days but i haven't prepared at all and nor did i learnt anything in my school as well as i didnt had any desire to do anything.  i always thinks how good it would be if i just died and think that suicide would be painful so if i just disappear from existence.   when i get really sad or am about to cry i suddenly gets goosebumps and starts thinking wow how amazing this emotion is and am sometimes think about how interesting my response would be to something much more sad happening like someone close to me dying but then i suddenly think what the he'll am i thinking.  i don't know what is wrong with me  <e1> but i sometime am happy that i m sad </e1>  as  <e2> i'm able to feel this emotions then suddenly starts thinking about dying	for last few years  <e1> i am always sad </e1> , <e2> i don't have interest in anything but used to like anime a lot but now don't have any motivation at all.   i just want to lie on my bed all the time and just think how bad i m .  my college entrance exams are in few days but i haven't prepared at all and nor did i learnt anything in my school as well as i didnt had any desire to do anything.  i always thinks how good it would be if i just died and think that suicide would be painful so if i just disappear from existence.   when i get really sad or am about to cry i suddenly gets goosebumps and starts thinking wow how amazing this emotion is and am sometimes think about how interesting my response would be to something much more sad happening like someone close to me dying but then i suddenly think what the he'll am i thinking.  i don't know what is wrong with me  <e1> but i sometime am happy that i m sad </e1>  as  <e2> i'm able to feel this emotions then suddenly starts thinking about dying </e2> .  am i mad or is it happens with everyone. 
im	sudden?	im literally sobbing.  want to know what? a tv character i liked just died.  this is the first time ive ever cried over a tv character.  death doesnt affect me at all, i could honestly care less.  but now here i am sitting on my bed sobbing.  if anyone is wondering what character its carl grimes from the walking dead.  i had to put my phone down and sit and just cry for 10 minutes.  why am i so sensitive all of a sudden?
im	sleep.	im sitting in the ruins of my life.  there used to be something here, a person. . . a person with dreams, a future, hope, friends, passion.  but that's gone now, and all that remains is the last debris of what once was, structures barely standing, crumbling. i'm looking around me in shock at how this happened, and i don'y believe i can rebuild it on my own, or with anyone for that matter.  it's gone, and all there is left is to suffer, to spend my days wondering about what could have been in a different life path. maybe it's better to accept the loss, and lie down to sleep. 
i have sever depression, sever anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and ptsd all medical diagnosed	i have had an ubundance of stress lately and i am tired of fighting it	i am in a polygamous relationship one guy one girl.   <e1> i have sever depression, sever anxiety, borderline personality disorder, and ptsd all medical diagnosed </e1> .  so  <e2> i have had an ubundance of stress lately and i am tired of fighting it </e2> .  i've tried voicing my struggles, which are seemingly being ignored or told to get over.  i walked home from work one car, bf was supposed to be at work.  i get fucked up qt work have to leave, like feeling like throwing up.  i walk home were saving money as much as possible to fix the car problem.  i am down right suicidal.  after nearly kicking down my own door, gf was supposed to be home, bf opens the door i don't fucking care.  he runs back to whatever she was off to, to complain.  how dare i? i go find a knife in the kitchen and put to my stomach.  this makes a huge ass fight.  why the fuck are they mad? why are they hurt? why does nothing i say matter? i finally thinking about myself and its the biggest problem that i don't want to. be in this constant abusive relationship with myself anymore?
so	this.	so my mom was never satisfied with me.  she studied hard as a child but was never on top.  she got divorced from her first husband and has 6 kids.  she always pushes me to be on top and gets mad at me whenever i make a mistake(no matter how big or small it is) or whenever i'm not on rank 1 in our school.  this year has been hard for me, i don't think i'm gonna be on rank 1 this grading.  i also skipped 2 of my classes today and she asked me why i skipped again.  i want to tell her that i don't have the motivation to do so and even if i don't want to skip my body just doesn't move.  i live in a country where parents don't take mental illness seriously.  she will constantly put her hands on me and shout hateful words to me whenever she's stressed and i did something she didn't like.  please give me a valid excuse as to why i didn't attend classes today.  she is asking me for an answer and i don't know what to tell her.  she'll be home in a few hours and i don't know what to do.  im sorry to bother anyone this might not seem to be a big deal but for me it is.  thank you so much for reading this. 
sitting	same.	sitting in the dark with a paralysed mind, the gentle breeze from the open window whilst my emotions close and withdraw once again.  here i go pushing myself away.  thoughts creep in and out momentarily, yet i remain still, processing and over analysing what moments pass. im not sure whats dragged my hand deeper into the depths ive spent months trying to claw out from.  i thought i cut these thoughts out of my memory.  the excuses spoken in silence begin to pile up as i flirt with the bottle. i cant forget you; i try all the time. i cannot forget you, with your grip in mine. is there signs of sunshine breaking this eternal darkness, knowing everything within me begins to break away, my breathing would pass, causing a sense of panic anxiety to get my heart racing, just to feel something again. cant you hear it in the silence? cant you hear me calling out your name? thats what i tell myself, paranoia and desperation beg for a response.  ive got something burning coursing through these cold veins.  in the words i speak, somehow, i get lost in between.  when to suffer in silence or to break it all with each breath that i breathe. maybe ill just hold it all in again, pass out until i dont feel the same. 
i'm still overjoyed	hear that conversation	i am currently in my usual several weeks of depression.   no hope and no hunger.  contrary to my loss of appetite, i packed two toasts in the toaster and prepared margarine and salami in the kitchen.  now my mother has asked me to put away the pillows on the terrace while she gets ready for work.  as i put a few pillows away, i hear my mother say to my father: i'm going to go right away.  max wanted to get something to eat.  remember, he hasn't eaten anything today. i was so happy to see my parents worry about me behind my back.  even now, a few hours later, with two toasts in my stomach,  <e1> i'm still overjoyed </e1>  to  <e2> hear that conversation </e2> .  a small spark of light during a week-long solar eclipse. i want to remind you that when you feel lonely and abandoned, there are still people behind your back who worry about you. 
relateable?	sleep?	relateable? today i woke up from a disgusting nightmare, as usual.  i go on social media to get my mind off of it then i instantly get mad again and beg to wake up.  no luck so far.  why can't i just die peacefully in my sleep?
i've	appreciated.	i've been clinically depressed for maybe a decade, little less.  it has been at its worst, but it is always faintly there when it's not.  very bad apathy, one apathy situation was put for seven months. i've entered apathy again, after a three or four month break.  everything is cringe worthy, things i would read and do.  i was skimming my pool this morning, and i thought it was really stupid.  i'm very disinterested in daily life, i. d. k.  what to do. . .  it is not that i am put on my phone all day, it is easier for me to do outdoor activities and cleaning i. d. k.  how to do all on my phone. any replies appreciated. 
why	more!	why do i make major mistakes again and again? i can't live my life just learning from mistakes again and again and again.  a few learnings here and there can be healthy but when it this fucking loop going to come to an end.  either i am lacking in a hundred different ways or its just bad luck times 50 everytime i encounter such a situation. this is in context of losing out on certain parts of my university degree that i am still enrolled on but i still feel i am losing out.  if anyone can relate i would love to know more!
i am always anxious	that affect my work also	i am 26 yo male, i have a good job and all but i am always depressed.  now i don't think of hurting myself or anything but i don't want to do anything.  i only want to lie there in my bed doing absolutely nothing and thinking about past and future.  i am not able to live the present.   <e1> i am always anxious </e1>  and  <e2> that affect my work also </e2> .  i mess up trivial task related to my work.  please help. 
even my dog looks at me like hes sad	we never do anything anymore	ive been abandoned by my family, begged my mom to come see me last night for today and she wouldnt come. . .  i begged and begged for her too even let her know im suicidal. . . i have no friends besides my noel, ive lost my tattoo job, ive lost my who i am as a person.   finally left my piece of shit boyfriend but now i am all alone with no real reason to get up in the morning besides taking care of my dog. &  <e1> even my dog looks at me like hes sad </e1>  because  <e2> we never do anything anymore </e2> . i just dont wanna try anymore, ive completely checked out of life and giving a fuck about it
im	family.	im not against having kids at all in fact ill probably end up having kids in the future but i feel that theres no denying that having kids is always selfish in some aspect if you think about itsure for some people life is amazing and theyre glad they were born but if you were never born you wouldnt know what life entails so it doesnt matterive had some good moments in my life but id still rather be non existent.  every second of life theres always something to worry about, were always trying to pursue happiness but what even is happiness? now im trapped in this body.  im stuck with being alive and theres no way out besides killing myself, but that would devastate my family. 
now im freaking out	i dont know if i double dosed on my trazodone	i took my lexapro at 10:00 pm and then took my trazodone for sleep at 2:20ish and right after i took it i thought to myself oh shit didnt i already take this?.  so  <e1> now im freaking out </e1>  because  <e2> i dont know if i double dosed on my trazodone </e2> .  and i am very afraid of getting of getting serotonin syndrome.  what should i do?????? im getting sleepy but dont wanna fall asleep in case anything feels wrong with my body. 
sorry	??	sorry about this- im really socially awkward and just wanted to say some stuff.  ive been saying i want to go home all the time.  especially when im already at home.  ive lived in this house most of my life but i still keep saying i want to go home.  i dont really know where that would be but i want it so badly. people in my life keep saying that i need to do my work.  one time i asked why and they said so you can be successful in your career and have a good life.  ive been thinking life was too hard since 5th grade.  if i cant handle that how am i supposed to be an adult.  i also just dont want to.  it seems like so much pain for no reason.  wasted energy and time.  if thats all there is to life then i really just dont want it. im so sick of all this bullshit.  i wish that i could just die and be reborn as someone i care about in my next life. if you made it though my weird rambling thank you.  i dont really know why but i feel a little better knowing someone will read this.  ??
im	life.	im sorry i  post so much here lately ive just been feeling lost.  i have no motivation to live anymore and i just dont know what to do.  i hurt myself tonight first time in awhile and im just so confused at where i am in life. 
she'll	better.	she'll never see this, but i can't believe my dumbass thought, even for a second, that i had a chance.  when she laid her head down on my chest and snuggled up on me in front of a bunch of other people at a party last week, i legit though that maybe, just maybe, she was interested.  maybe she could be the peace i've been searching so long for.  but hey, at least for that hour holding her close, i felt happy for the first time in a very long time.  so thank you for that hanna.  thank you for the briefest of reprieve from the darkness.  don't know why i got my hopes up.  i should have known better. 
1/2 of my clothes don't fit anymore either	i have avoided washing them	for the last few months i've been obsessed with trying to lose weight for a girl's trip and i haven't lost a single pound.  thanks to the pandemic i went from being 140 pounds to 165 pounds at 5'1.  i've tried vapor rub wraps, salt water flushes, starving myself, flat tummy teas, weight loss subliminals and nothing has worked :(i'm so embarrassed and ashamed of my body.  i can't believe i let myself get this big.  what's even worse is that it's a beach vacation.  i'm dreading having to be half naked around my skinny friends.  all of them are skinny except for me.  they never mentioned anything about my weight but i'm tired of being the fat friend.  idk what to do.  it's really starting to take a massive toll on my mental health.  i've been really depressed this last month and i feel like i can't live life until i'm skinny.   <e1> 1/2 of my clothes don't fit anymore either </e1>  so  <e2> i have avoided washing them </e2> .  i hate my body so much i want to cry, but i can't. 
i was so worked up	i grabbed a knife and cut my leg	hi my names jack, im 19, and i got diagnosed with depression when i was 15.  recently my friends have stopped talking to me and i feel like my family has forgotten about my.  recently i've been depersonalizing more than usual.  about i week ago i got home from work and was so frustrated i couldn't hold my feelings in.   <e1> i was so worked up </e1>   <e2> i grabbed a knife and cut my leg </e2> .  right after i did that i felt relief and kind of i blacked out and fell asleep.  every other day i feel so pent up with anger i keep getting into a cycle of doing this.  how can i stop? whats wrong with me? i feel like depression is fucking up my head in ways i cant fix. 
hello,i	broken	hello,i went through a lot of loss recently, and i have been physically unable to cry (or orgasm) in months.  but i'll focus on crying in this post. even if i have the urge to cry, my eyes stray predominantly dry and i can't squeeze one out.  i feel all the tension and pressure building up in my chest.  i just wish i could cry again.  it's been about 7 months since i've cried.  and i used to be super sentimental - able to cry at the drop of a hat with something happy or sad. i've tried talking to therapists, i've tried watching sad shows and listening to sad songs.  i've tried some youtube vidoeos.  still nothing works.  but every time i even start to cry, my body stops it immediately. has anyone else been through this? has anyone recovered? i feel like half of the human i used to be -- totally out of sync. the inability to orgasm is also sad.  i feel broken
i also fidget a lot, mainly with leg tapping	i believe this is from my anxiety	hi, i'm 13.  i've struggled with depression and anxiety for years now.  according to my dad i've been depressed since i started third grade so about 5 years.  when i moved away for a year it got really bad.  i'm now in seventh grade, on lexapro, and doing okay.  recently, i've been realizing i have a few things that don't fit in with depression.  i get points of time where i get really hyper and will go into cleaning mode (or get really dedicated to something else for a few hours).  sometimes it's almost like i just can't stop acting crazy or weird.  i'm also terrible at following instruction or catching mistakes in my math.  i make a lot of careless mistakes that i didn't used to make like thinking multiplication was addition.  i'm just bad at remembering things i should remember half the time.   <e1> i also fidget a lot, mainly with leg tapping </e1> , but  <e2> i believe this is from my anxiety </e2> a.  i honestly just don't know anymore.  it's too confusing for me to understand half the time. . . 
i	cheering.	i have none of the symptoms of depression other than extreme sadness, why am i so sad i have so much to be happy for but for some reason can't feel the happiness of anything, i always feel so empty and hallow whenever everyone else is giggling and cheering. 
you	go-to	you always put a smile on my facethanks for the stimulating conversationyou make me laugh so muchwhat about me? ill do anything and everything for my people.  but when do i get to be happy? when do i get to feel good about myself?but youre welcome i guess.  with love always, your depressed go-to
i	depressed,	i felt numb all day and now i'm suddenly spewdwalking to class excited to talk to my friend.  i'm, like, smiling to myself like an idiot too? how can a depressed person do this? am i not depressed,
nobody in my group does anything solo with me	im so depressed and sapped when we do	 <e1> nobody in my group does anything solo with me </e1>  because  <e2> im so depressed and sapped when we do </e2> .  how do i get that online gamer energy back again?
i'm	do	i'm depressed just want someone to talk to, to be there like i'm there for everyone else i text them right after a get the notification then i'm alone again i wish i wasn't lonely i had someone idk what to do
im	live.	im curious to see how people cope, and what has helped most in hard times.  for me, its been my chickens.  even though they are my school project (agriscience high school), i talk to them and play with them for hours each day.  my mood is so much better, and i just really enjoy watching them run around and live. 
i hate going on my newsfeed to see people sharing photos of them out drinking and having a good time	it just seems so fake	i was at a shopping centre earlier observing people and it made me feel disconnected from reality.  everyone seemed so stressed and just focused on materialism or looking at their mobile phones like programmed robots.   <e1> i hate going on my newsfeed to see people sharing photos of them out drinking and having a good time </e1>  because  <e2> it just seems so fake </e2> , if you are having a good time why do you need to share it? i dont feel like i can relate to anyone, my friends act the same they just want to go out drinking, take selfies and repeat until next weekend.  everyone just seems so soulless like there is no purpose anymore.  i feel so isolated surrounded by lifeless people that only seem to think and talk about themselves. 
sorry	much	sorry for my bad englisch im not a nativ. for many pepole i actually have the perfect life, i have a girlfriend, a good job and i have achieved a lot.  but i dont have a lot of friends, actually one friend.  but he life his own life, in the past time we dont do so much together.  he has his own friends, and me.  i dont know, i feel somtimes lonely, and it hurt so much.  i search for new friends, but i dosent work.  my life is really bad, im every day sad and life sucks. .  i dont know what to do, im really tiert of all the pain that i dont have a really friend with i can talk to. . it hurts so much
he	gone.	he makes me feel so worthless and horrible.  i wish i was dead when hes angry with me.  but when hes actually nice like 1/3 of the time i feel like my depression is gone. 
when i see other people getting excited i become depressed	i want to feel butterflies in my stomach and just happiness	i remember a time where i would get so excited that i wouldnt be able to fall asleep the night before.  i remember starting college and being so excited to start my life.  i feel like there is nothing that makes me excited that that anymore.  im not excited at work even when i got a new job.  im not excited about moving out from my parents house.  im glad about it but not excited.   <e1> when i see other people getting excited i become depressed </e1>  because  <e2> i want to feel butterflies in my stomach and just happiness </e2> .  but im not not able to achieve that emotion. 
everyday	all	everyday i wake up in the dark loathing everything about my life, bored out of my mind and wishing i could just reset it all and start fresh in a different body; and then i go toil destroying my body just so i can survive.  when i tell people that i'm depressed and bored they tell me to just go do something: but im doing things all day.  im working, im gaming: i try and go to school, i try to read, or clean, or eat but i can never do it; and none of it is interesting, it doesn't engage or amuse or even occupy.   its like everything i try is destined to fail while i watch screaming in my head to do anything about it but im still stuck bored doing nothing.  i envy the religious.  believing in an afterlife must make dying so much easier.     im bored of everything about this life, yet too terrified of non-existence to just end it all
it's	response?	it's been almost 4 years since i decided to go all in and bet on my self.  that bet has paid off i can say i no longer feel depressed i can actually enjoy life, im almost done with my degree, have my own place and new job.  life is looking up for me but i still feel like many people are either afraid to ask or might still believe i'm depressed.  im not the greatest looking guy but i have confidence in who i am.  i want to start dating  i'm more old school i much rather meet people normally than via an app.  this leaves me with mostly meeting friends of friends but i feel like word to mouth has gotten around that  hey this guy was off his rocker for some time.  i want to remove any doubt from anyones mind not that i owe to them but so i can advertise my self better.  so has anyone ever made a post updating friends about their depression if so what was the response?
i dont see any light at the end of the tunnel	i am pretty much decided that ill be taking my own life soon	hey everyone. ive been struggling with pretty severe depression for about 4 years now.  certain events occurred recently that made my depression even worse.   <e1> i dont see any light at the end of the tunnel </e1> , so  <e2> i am pretty much decided that ill be taking my own life soon </e2> , i just have some things i have to settle with family and friends.  im curious about those who previously attempted suicide, how did you guys spend your final moments.  did you spend it alone, did you spend it with family or friends? and also how did you guys come to grips that you were about to take your own life.  did you fear it? did you accept it?
im posting this here	its making me really depressed	ive been dying and crying for a cat my entire life and my mom would never let me get one and a few months ago i got a kitten and she was the cutest she would cuddle with me and sleep with me and show her love back but recently as shes grown up more she despises me she literally walks away from me and hisses at me when i try to hold her and i know its pathetic but it makes me sad that even a cat doesnt like me and again i know this is dumb but it makes me so fucking sad she goes and sleeps by my sister who hates cats and despises them yet she sleeps by her and purs on her.  i really wanted a cat for my anxiety too but i feel no connection with her and idk why  <e1> im posting this here </e1>  and  <e2> its making me really depressed </e2>  i hate my life enough and i thought a cat would make it better but i guess not.  idk what im doing wrong
yet i am still afraid to die	i'm still stuck in this endless loop of nothingness	i have no idea who i am anymore.  i have no goals.  i have no desires.   <e1> yet i am still afraid to die </e1> , so  <e2> i'm still stuck in this endless loop of nothingness </e2> .  does anyone feel the same? i don't even know what i should do anymore.

i have a loving girlfriend	i'm so happy for that	 <e1> i have a loving girlfriend </e1>   <e2> i'm so happy for that </e2>  and i have a job now but i just feel like none of it matters as if there's no point in trying to keep my job and her she makes me feel happy, smile and laughbut just sometimes i feel like my job doesn't matter and she doesn't really want to be with me
wake	all	wake up miserable and suffer or bs a day off then feel guilty and miserable at home. . .  i've been fucking up for the last 3 days and having to get reprimanded and then immediately hear my other coworker be praised broke me.  i lied to get out of going today and now i'm feeling like even more of a pussy failure.  wish i had a gun i'd just end it all
feeling	sudden.	feeling like a failure and so stressed about everything.  lonely with no one to talk to and people around me just keep taking and taking everything from me.  i feel angry all the time and then feel extremely sad and sometimes tears just appear out of sudden. 
just	dead.	just 2 years ago i thought i would never be depressed.  within the last weeks i've gone from depressed to suicidal.  i've forgotten to take my meds, i'm a fucking mess.  i can't do this.  every time i think about my family i think they'd be so much better off if i wasn't alive.  i just wish i was dead. 
i	die	i wish i was dead, i don't have the ability to feel anything anymore.  i feel so empty and numb inside.  connecting with anyone is hard, i used to be very social and now i just lay in bed hoping to die
i almost broke down the other day	i was asked to tidy some stuff	it's so tiring, probably one of the hardest things to keep doing, pretending you're not totally broken.  but i can't not do it.  i can't tell people how i really feel or that i just want to stay in bed all week. i get home from work and collapse.  i can't look after myself at home, i don't cook or clean and i feel terrible for not being a better flatmate.   <e1> i almost broke down the other day </e1>  because  <e2> i was asked to tidy some stuff </e2> .  i feel so pathetic. thankfully i have a good work pattern (4 days on/off) and i can recharge between rotations.  the standard work week destroyed my ability to do anything, i couldn't get out of the house and i'd pace trying to work up the ability to open my front door.  this job is the first time i've felt even a little more stable since i broke down 5 years ago and i'm terrified everything will fall apart. i can feel myself being stretched, i'm trying to better myself but whay little i can manage feels like treading water.  if i could see more positive change maybe drowning wouldn't feel so inevitable. 
i	numb?	i cant imagine how many days i have wasted to being sad and crying and not being able to accomplish the things i need to do.  i have responsibilities i have deadlines and none of them seem to matter when i am in these dark episodes.  how can you force yourself to do what needs to be done when you feel so hopeless and numb?
what	:)	what is even the fucking point anymore? i took my bird out when the door was open and it flew off my shoulder.  in a moment of panic i slammed the door. . .  right onto his head.  everyone in my family is telling me its not your fault and it was a mistake, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? me.  and now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those i love.  i hate myself so much i dont even see the point of going on anymore. edit: oh my god, thank you everyone! its been a really hard day and the support ive had from my family and you guys has helped a lot.  its still an on going process, but im trying not to blame myself for it.  hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know i wasnt alone in this and that it is possible to move on.  thanks guys :)
i hate that phrase, and i mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesnt actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better	trying to helpas someone who is depressed suicide isnt an option on the table for me yet	 <e1> i hate that phrase, and i mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesnt actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better </e1>  for  <e2> trying to helpas someone who is depressed suicide isnt an option on the table for me yet </e2> ,  but when it comes to it the only thing im gonna hear or read if someone says that to me is that its a solutionedit:  sorry.   the phrase is suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemdoesnt change anything i just said though. 
certain things will cause me to break down and cry	previous trauma	it's so fucked up.  despite enduring abuse from my home environment, and relentless bullying at school i'm the one who has to pay the price.  i'm the one who has to pay for the therapy sessions, i'm the one who had to move out and pay for the cost of living at age 17. it's so fucked up.  despite this, people expect me to just get on with life.  i'm treated as if yeah we all have shit going on, just get on with it.  they don't realise how hard it is for me to get through a week doing basic activities, let alone finish getting a degree. basic tasks like walking in the city and hearing people laugh is stressful for me.  i automatically assume they're laughing at me.  i'll be coming home on the bus and feel like people around me are judging my appearance.   <e1> certain things will cause me to break down and cry </e1>  due to  <e2> previous trauma </e2> .  yet no one fucking acknowledges it. living with trauma is like going on a hike where you have a 30kg weight strapped to your back whereas everyone else has a 5kg weight strapped to their back with a head start.  life is significantly harder yet others don't see it. they'll oversimplify it.  no one cares, just stop worrying.  when you go through years of bullying, you get conditioned that people in fact absolutely do care.   yet i'm treated as if i'm the crazy one.

he	friends.	he was 18.  i grew up with him and he was like my little brother.  he was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes.  he was quiet and calm in a world that is loud and harsh.  he killed himself.   he didn't let anyone see all the pain he was carrying every day.  he was exhausted and he only saw one option and now i'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself.  i am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and i can't breathe.  i feel too much while feeling too little.   i have struggled with depression and anxiety for years.  but this.  this is. . . overwhelming.  it is excruciating.  it is numbing.  it is agonizing and yet it is impassive.   i feel everything and i feel nothing.    i don't want to die.  but i don't know how to live. i'm fighting every day.  i'm pushing through for my family and friends who are also experiencing this loss and my cats who need me to feed them breakfast.  every day is a struggle right now.  but i'm fighting.  keep fighting, friends. 
i	much.	i have two cats that live with me right now.  they know when i'm sad or having a breakdown they come over and comfort me.  i've been at my breaking point the last couple of days but they literally lay next to me at night making sure i'm okay.  they are keeping me alive at this point and i love them so much.

ive	all.	ive just come home from a pretty decent, much needed party where i had a good time, but ever since i got home by myself i cant shake the old, bad feelings off. .  it just feels like they assaulted me all at once and its a lot to deal with.  what makes me sad is that they somehow always come back to me even during a decent time of my life, also this feeling of being alone. .  i just wanted to get this it out there so that maybe someone can read it and feel less alone in this world, take care everybody, sending much love to you all. 
firstly,	fire?	firstly, i want to thank you all out there for being such a supportive bunch.  i'm recovering from a 10-year long depressive phase, but obviously i take a few steps back once in a while.  although i've never posted here before, i routinely read the posts.  and, you're all beautiful people.  struggling, getting over, struggling more, helping each other. . . i want to say, i'll be here for anybody who needs me.  just pm me. something small for all you:hello, how are you? how are you holding up?can you hear me in this deep, dark abyssof your breath turning into cold air?will you let me hold your hand ifi promise to hold it till your heartceases to dance in a frenzy around the fire?
as	.	as i'm sitting here, and holding my cold beer glass in my warm hand.  feeling how cold condense drips on my leg. .  looking out of the window, seeing how stars are bright shining. . .  do they ever feel that we are watching them and waiting for them to fall so we can wish for something.  feeling cold summer breeze in my face. .  how my long hair tangles in that wind. . .  while i watch how one after other stars falls down into my lap. .  hoping i'm fast enough to think of an wish i would like to have. . . 
wondering	guys	wondering if anyone can help or speak to this.  i feel so desperate for help and for therapy but 50 min once a week is impossible to make any dent on what i feel like is the mountain of issues i need to address.  has anyone had success with intensive therapy or retreats? i just feel like i cant keep making such tiny steps forward when i feel like i cant move forward with my life until i significantly address some things.  thank you guys
i	start.	i moved july 2019 and never unpacked.  stuff has just kind of piled up around the boxes. when i google how to clean a messy house i get like those houses that are super clean with like magazines and shoes scattered around.  i'm not like hoarders bad, but its going to need a battle plan. i have 2 weeks until the summer semester starts.  i'm a little manic and i think i'm ready to take advantage of this.  i just don't know where to start. my mom told me she will help, and i need to get some large storage totes.  other than that i don't know what to do.  i have 2 bedrooms (1 bedroom and 1 i use as an office/study), an open living room/dining room/kitchen, and a bathroom.  i have said that since i've gone this long without using so much of my stuff, i will likely donate a lot of it. how do i tackle this? i don't even know where to start. 
ever	seem	ever since i was a child and my mom gained custody over me i feel my life has been  stagnant full of self pitty and hate.  unless i'm pulled out of bed or forced to face the day by outside means i tend to just wake up and do nothing.  maybe look at my phone and get bored and just go back to staring at the ceiling and try to turn my mind off and eventually i'll find my way out of bed and get to work either just in time or several minutes late. i'm guess i'm pretty depressing.  i tend to think about getting help so much i convince my self it's not worth it.  i just want to know how to break out of this cycle.  people i once called friends have tried to help me before but they've either stoped caring or i've cut them out of my life for my own crazy reasonings. i know i'm a pice of shit asshole.  and i want to get better but i can't bring my self to make a significant effort .  i don't t i ow where or how to start l.  what seem
it's so toxic, i hate all of them to be honest but i can't get any new friends	i'm so unpopular	in my friend group there's 6 people (including me), two of which i have been friends with for 5 plus years, the other three for only a year ish.  the two friends which i have been friends with for longer no longer talk to the other 4 of us.  one of the girls made a terrible joke which i believe caused this.  the two friends don't have a problem with me, it's just the others.   <e1> it's so toxic, i hate all of them to be honest but i can't get any new friends </e1>  because  <e2> i'm so unpopular </e2> .  im constantly the subjects of jokes but no one thinks twice.  i was on the verge of tears the other day after having a awful lesson and being shouted at but they just laughed at me.  i hate everyone so much but i don't know what to do.  i'm so depressed and have no one to even talk to about my problems, ontop of that i'm trans and i can't handle people using she/her pronouns anymore.  i'd rather just isolate myself from them.  dysphoria is killing me and i can't take it anymore. 
background:	advance!!	background: battled depression without medication for years while the side-symptom of rage (suppressed) got channeled into cleaning. three years of targeted ssris and i'm happy and way less angry, but my motivation levels are at absolute zero.  my home and shows the effects. i think i've found some great tools for when i can get going on getting the job done (sincerely, unfuck your habitat is exactly what i need. . .  soon i hope) but for now i need something to make me want to sort myself out. . . . any ideas?thank you, sincerely, in advance!!
i'm just putting it out there how i feel	i'm struggling lately and honestly don't know what to do	i'm a guy in my late 20s (27) and i feel i've got to a point in my life where i'm just stuck in a perpetual loop my life has ups but then i come back around to a deep low stuck in a loop of feeling isolated and alone trying to find work applying for jobs (i left my job nearly two years ago due to depression) but never getting anywhere with job interviews and no follow ups.  its getting harder to carry on when i feel like i know what's going to happen i always end up back in the same place but with added baggage and stress feeling more alone and with less hope of any real change.  i have tried to make changes in my life tried hobbies or clubs but i just still feel empty and they never really go anywhere i just go back to where i started with less want to keep trying, i don't really have any friends and nobody close to me i've always felt like a after thought i'm a back ground character to everyone else's story.  guess  <e1> i'm just putting it out there how i feel </e1>  because  <e2> i'm struggling lately and honestly don't know what to do </e2> . 
can	it	can i just talk to someone my life has been going down hill and i dont know who to talk to.  my friends are drifting farther and farther away and no one checks in on me anymore.  i have a feeling this post will do nothing for me but i need someone to allow me to get all this off my chest.  idk anymore i cant take it
has	tired.	has anyone else felt like this? even little things seems to trigger my desire to just die.  the stress of buying a home is triggering these thoughts.  i feel stupid for wanting to die every time bad things or inconveniences happen to me.  whats wrong with me? if i just shoot myself w a gun or die of a horrible car accident, all my problem and stress would just go away.  i wouldnt have to worry about being all these problems in my life. the only thing stopping me are my kids and husband.  whos gunna take care of them? my kids cant grow up without a mom.  but idk how much longer i can continue.  ive tried getting professional help. . . it doesnt work.  nothing will make these thoughts go away.  ive been depressed my whole life.  i just want to give up already.  im tired. 
i	this?	i dont know where to turn.  i took my second dose of the pfizer about a week ago and ever since sunday ive been in the worst depression of my life.  ive been without it for almost four years (im 19).  i cant eat, i can barely make myself get up, i sleep all day, everything that excited me a week who doesnt even get a smile out of me.  its like in a few days ive become a completely different person and i dont know what to do.  is anyone else experiencing this?

i feel stupid	not being able to keep up	this whole semester i had such bad mental breakdowns.  id be productive for a few days just to crash again.  it has been so hard for me to keep up with school.  i had to ask my professor for an extension and i feel horrible about it.   <e1> i feel stupid </e1>  for  <e2> not being able to keep up </e2> .  i feel frustrated that this is my last course before i graduate that i actually didnt even really need.  i feel so stupid.  i feel like im faking my depression and using it as an excuse to get out of exams when i wanted to study so bad some days yet at the same time could not make myself move, and other days just opposed the idea of doing anything. what can i tell myself to stop feeling so bad? i know this isnt even anything serious.  this isnt going to hurt me at all.  i couldve failed instead even and that would be horrible.  but i just wanted to keep up with the course like normal.  i didnt want to have to ask for anything at all.

hello	you.	hello everyone, for the past month and a half, i(16m) have been very down.  i used to be able to cheer myself up, spend time with my girlfriend or hang out with friends to cheer me up.  but, this time it seems nothing can bring me joy anymore.  these feelings being down normally last about a week.  they started when i was in 7th grade 3 years ago.  but, no matter what i do i feel like i'm becoming more and more saddened by everything.  i normally see my therapist every friday.  the visits that i have are very beneficial.  i believe with the next visit i'm going to talk to him about being tested for depression but, i don't exactly know how i should approach that or how it's done.  so if anyone could please help me with how i should approach this, it would be greatly appreciated. thank you. 
i tend to vary between extremes - either i can't stop eating (because i'm depressed and bored and have no hobbies that bring me joy so i eat to pass the time) or i am too depressed to prepare myself food at all	so i end up ordering out expensive food just so i don't starve myself because i have blood sugar issues	 <e1> i tend to vary between extremes - either i can't stop eating (because i'm depressed and bored and have no hobbies that bring me joy so i eat to pass the time) or i am too depressed to prepare myself food at all </e1>  ( <e2> so i end up ordering out expensive food just so i don't starve myself because i have blood sugar issues </e2> ). does anyone have any advice on how to have a more healthy relationship with food without spending a fortune?(i am much more likely to cook if it is for other people.  it just never seems worth it for myself - i can't motivate myself to it)

i have my own appartment, but prefer spending time at my parents' house	that's where my cats live	after a four month sick leave due to burn-out and severe depression, i started working again today.  and i just can't!i feel like i'm in over my head, although it's the same job as before.  somehow it just feels all wrong and i could cry the entire time. heck, i'm almost 43 years old and i have nothing to show for in my life! no so, no children, no friends.  only my family and my fur-babies give me any sort of comfort.  <e1> i have my own appartment, but prefer spending time at my parents' house </e1> , because  <e2> that's where my cats live </e2>  (i don't want to take them away from their own private garden-and-woods paradise to live in a tiny appartment). at the moment i feel like i've reached the end of my road.  somewhere along the way i lost all of my wishes and dreams and became this permanently depressed shadow of the person i had hoped to be!i am in therapy and it helps some, but i feel like the dark days keep getting darker while the happy days keep getting fewer and fewer.  does it even make sense to go on?sorry for the rant. . . 
i	tia	i have taken snri (effexor) for the past 10+ years.   i am concerned about the long term effects and want to get off of it.  i know it is brutal to get off of, but im committed to making it happen.  i have done a lot of research on psilocybin (magic mushrooms) as a treatment for depression.  there is a lot of promising and positive data about studies that have been and are being done.    my questions are, 1.  any advice for getting off of effexor.   2.   has anyone had any experience with psilocybin?  if so, has it helped with your depression and/or anxiety?  3.   any experience with psilocybin as it relates to getting off is snris, will it help with the withdrawal symptoms?  tia
i sometimes think about suicide and i want to be able to stop that thought process before i go down a road of shitty feelings	and because of me repressing my emotions	ive been feeling a lot better as of recently after struggling for a long time.  i have kind of been repressing my emotions and dealing with them myself.  does anyone have good strategies into dealing with their negative thoughts?  <e1> i sometimes think about suicide and i want to be able to stop that thought process before i go down a road of shitty feelings </e1> .  <e2> and because of me repressing my emotions </e2> , when i dont feel mentally good i dont like to interact with people and i feel like they know how i feel and judge me the way i judge myself. 
17	people	17 why should i fucking watch it im a failure my sister does all my school work for me online because im too depressed to wake up i contributed nothing besides sleeping pacing around my room sometimes slowly cleaning it and buying stuff online with whatever money i have from selling stuff to fill in the hole of depression.  im in emotionless depressed trend bless nothing im not gonna get a job when i get older i dont wanna get older i wanna kill myself i dont want to get better im a terrible person i just make more work for people
since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she scams family and friends for money	she doesnt have to get a job	we brought our adult 19yr old daughter up in a loving good home gave her everything.    <e1> since been a teenager all her morals have changed she swears is disrespectful tells her friends lies that we are awful parents she scams family and friends for money </e1>  so  <e2> she doesnt have to get a job </e2> .  she rarely calls only if she wants something.  she never even contacts he brother or sister.  she is addicted to her phone.  when she lived at home if we took it off her at night she would be violent attack at us.  she quit uni.  she hangs out with negative people.  she always plays the victim mentality.   she recently told me her friend is a prostitute but swear mum im not. . i dont believe her she lies now.   i feel so sad.  i never thought she would grow to be this personality.  she was a beautiful child.  it makes me so depressed. 
i	time.	i feel like a complete failure at everything i do.  everyone in my life says im so talented or that im smart or have potential but every time i hear someone say that it makes me want to shoot myself in the fucking face.  whenever i hear these things my ego just gets bigger and it gives me a reason to think  maby im not so bad which i then immediately disprove by doing some other stupid shit, i cant get get relationships right, im pretty sure my girlfriend is slowly loosing interest in me, and i dont blame her, i would too.  im not good at sex and fail to pleasure my partner, im terrible at work and am constantly overshadowed by new employees despite my seniority, im failing all my classes at school and i havnt spoken to my friends at all recently due to a lack of motivation.  i feel like im looking in on the world from outside a glass door, and i hate it, i hate myself, i hate every decision that i make, will make, or have made, and i wish nothing but the worst upon myself.  im at a point where i do all of these things and feel no remorse, i feel no sadness, im just an empty sad excuse for a man looking for my next momentary shot of dopamine to keep me from loosing my mind and realizing what a piece of shit i am.  thanks for your time. 
everywhere	life?	everywhere i look is someone who is better than me at something, or someone who looks happier than me.  i try to fix this by practicing at being talented at one of my video games so that i for once have something to be proud of, but no matter what i do i just end up getting frustrated and start insulting myself constantly saying i'm pathetic and i don't deserve anything or anyone because of this.  this is especially the case in pvp games, the kind i most enjoy when i'm winning.  even outside of video games though i can't help but to get envious of literally everyone, even if they have their own life troubles i don't realise.  i don't know what to do from here, every attempt at saying something good about myself has failed and i feel like i cannot go a day on the internet without seeing something that makes me hate myself again.  how do i get rid of my bottomless supply of envy and low self-esteem and stop getting frustrated at my life?
one	better.	one minute youre fine and the next you feel so down that you cant even get up or think or do anything and all for no fucking reason.  like nothings wrong but you just feel so down for no reason.   it legit makes no sense. update: everyone relating to this actually made me feel a little better, so thanks to everyone.  i hope you guys feel better. 
i	end.	i worked very hard for a long time.  in 2017, i decided to stay sober and focus on being responsible, volunteering, improving myself.  nine months later some teenager hit me with his car (no trial, no jail time), shattered 13 of my bones, and ruined the sensation in my right hand.  a year and about 100 pt sessions later, my mom was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, which has now become a glioblastoma; shes immobile and can barely speak.  this diagnosis came less than six months after she retired. over the past four years, my dog died; my ex  only person ive ever loved  married someone far more handsome and richer than me; i lost my job as covid hit, despite making so many sacrifices; and now im living at home, over 30, my mothers caretaker.  i think im also becoming an alcoholic. i dont want to travel.  i dont want to fall in love.  i dont want a pet.  i dont want a good job.  i dont want a nice apartment.  i dont want to meet new people.  i just want this all to end. 
She is very anxious and self conscious of her weight	it's driving her mad	My bestfriend suffers from BDD, I want to help but I don't know how.  A bit of backstory is, when she was younger she used to be quite fat and throughout the recent years she's wanted to be skinny and fit and has worked hard to do so, but at one point in time she got really skinny and unhealthy but shes put some weight back on, still underweight but not super unhealthy, she craves to be skinnier and she wants to be like she used to be which is just unhealthy.   <e1> She is very anxious and self conscious of her weight </e1> and  <e2> it's driving her mad </e2> , she really needs help. I'm helping her look for a therapist but I want to know if there's anything I myself can do to help her in the meanwhile.  If ANYONE has ANY suggestions or help it would be appreciated a ton.  Thank you so much. 
Should	zolaft.	Should I take a small dose?I was on celexa 20mg for 2 weeks, then down to 10mg for 10 days.  I have not taken it for 5 days.  Should I take 5 mg?I was on zolaft for 7 days prior to celexa, and paxil 7 days prior to the zolaft. 
I moved to another city	we pretty much only talk through skyp and play some stuff together	So I'm currently having to decide what I'm gonna study in college, etc. I've been pretty depressed for a few months and sometines I can actually think positive and kinda halt my depression. But now I'm honestly questioning if living my life is worth it. I know there might be some tough shit but some amazing stuff as well.  But is it worth it?Also, being realistic, my life's been really boring so far.  I don't go out, I have few friends but  <e1> I moved to another city </e1>  and  <e2> we pretty much only talk through skyp and play some stuff together </e2> .  I'm not an attractive person, I'm not fit, I'm not funny, social and I'm just relatively smart but I'm way too lazy.  Yeah it's been over one and a half decade and I have no great amazing memories since my days are pretty much the same. So my actual question is: is living worth? But more specifically, is it worth trying to change my flaws in order to make life interesting? It's not gonna be easy and I'm not sure if it's really gonna be worth it. That's all, sorry for the long post. 
Hi	interested?	Hi everyone! I have looked through our subreddit a bit, and have noticed that some people have been looking for accountability partners.  I was wondering if anyone was willing to work with me, whether it be one other person or a small group.  I am envisioning checking in before bed each night to write down a schedule of events and tasks for the next day, and saying how that day's plans went.  It'll be a supportive thing, but also a kick in the butt thing.  We can either do a daily post here in this subreddit, or if we feel that it would clutter this page up too much, we can post to a separate subreddit (I made rADHDAccountability just in case, but we don't have to use it). Anyone interested?
Along	.	Along taking 50mg Vyvanse, I'm trying to start regular aerobiccardio excercise which is recommended for help in coping with adhd symptoms.  When I got on the eliptical today I had taken the meds a hour before hand.  But, it seemed way too easy on the maxlchine.  I don't know if this is from me doing this more regularly or if it was timing after taking the meds.  I was glad I did so well, but a part if me is afraid that this was a positive reaction to the meds which makes me afraid of performance dropping if I had to stop the meds for some reason. What has been your experience with excercising while on stimulants?  Looks like I was a bit scattered with the background story.  Makes you think I have ADD or something. . . . 
For	this	For example, I'm feeling pretty anxious today and within an hour I've bounced back and forth to  washing laundry, doodlingwriting in my journal, browsing the internet, reading a book, and watching a movie that I put on before all this 
I'm	sad	I'm ruining everyone's day.   I have no positive influence on the world.    The rational decision is suicide.   There isn't one thing I enjoy and I'm just called a pussy for being depressed.   The drugs are helping but from hell to bad isn't fun.   Now it's hell again.   I have nothing.   They're all gone.   I tried to play steam sale games but now I'm just bad at everything.   I don't need a response I'm just venting and sad
maybe	please	maybe i need some verification that i'm real.  i'm pretty drunk.  and high.  and i've just munched down some antidepressants.  i don't know where i'm going with this.  can someone please just tell me i'm actually here right now and am a real person. i'm 23 and don't want to end up a statistic.  but reddit SW is the only supportive community i know that i can be totally anon in.  someone please just let me know i'm a real, worthwhile person.  no matter how stupid or fucking pathetic i am.  please
Hey	;3	Hey bipolarreddit.   Just checking in, wanting to see how everyone's holding up today.   I know this is a really hard time of year for us and I wanted to wish you all happy holidays.   I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones today.   And if you are spending the holiday by yourself, my heart goes out to you.   Take care of yourself today if you can.   Feel free to check in on this thread if you want to get anything off your chest.   ;3 ;3 ;3
please go dead silent around me, silent	il go  away	I'm normaly happy go lucky but I'm constantly interrupting I can't stop myself from being stupid and I'm sick of feeling like this and just how per  <e1> please go dead silent around me, silent </e1> because  <e2> il go  away </e2> , I'm probably just down tonight but this is killing me inside, I can't even remember the last time I've felt normal 
askreddit	yeah	askreddit won't let me post this because i don't know how to word it as a non-yesno question.  every time someone talks about losing a parent to suicide, they talk about how painful it was, and how they wish the parent hadn't done it.  i can't imagine that's ALWAYS the case, though.  if your parent beat you, would you really rather have them hanging around beating you than if they just killed themselves? if it came down to them killing themselves or killing you, wouldn't you be glad they chose themselves? isn't there anyone out there who can say yeah
I	environment?	I was recently diagnosed with ADHD.  I was on Adderall xr 20mg for a couple weeks, then switched to Vyvanse 30mg after bad headaches with coming down from the adderall. I was never diagnosed as a child or teenager and have always been really organized when at school, home, etc.  I'm just wondering if others have had similar experiences.  Did I adapt early on? Can a person have varying symptoms of ADHD?Some of my strategies in college were to have a five subject notebook for every semester to take constant lecture notes, though I never really reviewed those notes later.   TL;DRCan one adapt to ADHD and be organized while being able to thrive in a structured environment?
I	holidays.	I thought I could handle a few at Christmas, but evidently that is not true.  Here's to a new day and the start of a new 3 months sobriety. That's all folks, happy holidays.  
I've gone from 18mg to 54mg over the past three months	irritability getting worse	Anybody experience extreme irritability on Concerta?  <e1> I've gone from 18mg to 54mg over the past three months </e1> .  As my dose increased, I noticed my  <e2> irritability getting worse </e2> .  I started going to bed at around 10pm and waking up at 6am every day, eating better and getting moderate exercise to rule out any lifestyle possibilities and found that as my dosage increased, I started to get more irrationally irritable about stupid things.  After my lifestyle change I was more conscious about it and could tell when I was being ridiculous vs when I had an actual reason to be irritated, and I can compare it best to someone on their period crying and knowing they don't have a reason to be sad but unable to stop crying.  I have also noticed that irritability is my only emotion on Concerta, and when I have a reason to cry or be upset I almost feel numb.  This is the same with happiness as well but to a lesser degree.  Anyone have similar experiences?
It	x	It is so discouraging.  I need a written list to remember more than four or five things.  My husband will call me when I'm on my way home if we need something from the grocery store.  I ask him specifically and directly to send me a list via text because I'm driving and can't write it down.  I can check it when I get to the store and I wont overlook anything.  Then he will start rattling off more things and I interrupt saying send me a list.  He gets frustrated saying you need a list for x
When	better.	When you're at the point where you can't get out of bed, have completely isolated your self for months, want to die.  Where and how do you begin to get better.  
I'm	.	I'm just going to treat this night like any other night.  By using video games to escape from depression. I asked random people in the lobbies I was matched in a while ago why they were playing League.  I generally either got no answers or passive-aggressive answers. Looks like a fair amount of people playing League are depressed too.  At least I'm not alone with being alone tonight. Sigh. . . Happy New Year's Eve everyone. . . . 
I	festivities?	I stayed in with my partner and dogs.  Had a nice snuggle in bed.  I wouldn't have wanted it any other way actually.  Did any of you make it out? Did you stay in? Were you happy? Or did you feel isolated and regretful about your agoraphobia on an eve of festivities?
Made a batch of mead	I was able to do a task for 4 hours without needing a break or getting distracted	Feels good maaaaaaaaaan.   <e1> Made a batch of mead </e1> , and this is the first time in 6 years of medicating that  <e2> I was able to do a task for 4 hours without needing a break or getting distracted </e2> .  Just felt the impulsive urge to share! Sorry!
So	meds?	So I (22m) am going through the process of getting diagnosed with ADHD.  Right now all I want are answers for my struggles and problems.  One day I would like to start medication, however I am afraid of any personality changes that may develop because of medication.  I really like who I am right now, even with ADHD, I have learned to compensate and improve my quality of life to a higher level through finding what helps me concentrate. Did you guys have any negative personality changes associated with taking meds?
I quit drinking	myself, and myself alone	On new years day I posted for my one year anniversary and talked about my resolution this year.  I mentioned that I wanted to stop being so easily influenced by my surroundings and start doing the influencing for once.  Well, it seems the universe has heard me, in the last 2 days a small handful of friends have gotten in touch with me to tell me that they are giving sobriety a shot and to ask how I did it.  So all you folks out there who are living day by day, staying sober, you never know who might notice and feel inspired to be a better person.   <e1> I quit drinking </e1>  for  <e2> myself, and myself alone </e2> , but when you take care of yourself you also care for those around you.  Keep up the good work SD.  
I	title*	I was almost overwhelmed when I ventured out for snacks today:* There are self-serve checkouts with bright, flashing lights  * You have to wait your turn and anticipate when somebody is leaving so you can get your spot.  My mind was racing and I was noticing every other detail in the place except what I **should've** been focusing on.  It took someone behind me to snap me out of my trance and point out an empty space. Anybody else experiences this? This is why I do my shopping online. **TL;DR:** *See the title*
I'll	effective?	I'll try and keep it short, but over the past year I've tried just about every stimulant and have not had consistent success.  My main issue has been that a medication seems to work, but suddenly stops and makes me tired all  together or I crash prematurely.  Like other people on here, I enjoy caffeine, especially energy drinks.  I try to limit my intake, but keep going through this vicious cycle of being tired and trying to drink caffeine to pick me up.  I have also tried to cut it out a couple times, but I digress.  Does someone's caffeine tolerance (since it's a stimulant) have anything to do with the effectiveness and tolerance of stimulant medications? Would not drinking caffeine anymore lower my tolerance to all stimulants and make them more effective?  
So	somewhere.	So today my brother was supposed to drive me to get my prescription (I'm 21 with no license because I can't focus on the road we'll enough) and he refuses to do so because I don't need adderal.  He just came back from college and is pretending he knows me and what I need.  Where not even fucking close! When he was living at home we barely even talked to each other.  Now he wants to sit my parents down and convince them against medication.  The fucking guy who can sit there for 8 hours working nonstop and has things to show for in life is going to tell me how to live mine?! Tl;dr: brother doesn't agree with my medication Sorry I'm just pissed off and need to vent somewhere. 
My	ya	My name is mark.  I'm 15.  And all my friends just left me.  The love of my life is done with my stupid narcissistic depressing bullshit.  And cut off contact with me.  Her best friend.  One of my best friends.  Went with her.  After 2 years of knowing them I'm finally completely alone.  But I feel so determined, I feel excited.  I want to be everything she wanted me to be now that she's Gone.  Strong and confident, mature, the person I used to be.  For the first time in a year I'm fucking happy about being able to live my life.  I'm also sad, she's gone, and she's not coming back, but this sparks a new time in my life.  The evolution of myself.  Anyways, thanks for listening.  Remember to focus on the little things that make your life a little better.  See ya
On	stimulants.	On mobile, apologies. I've started keeping track of my water intake with the habitbull app that was posted here a couple days ago.  Just wondering if someone can offer any insight. Looking back on my day, I inadvertently doubled up on my morning and afternoon dose of adderall, 20mg ir.  I've been filling and filling my water bottle a lot today.  I'm just sipping, really. . .  Not chugging.  But through the app I've tracked every fill up of my 20 oz bottle and I'm up to 120 oz just today.  I haven't had appetite or eaten all day, but I kicked ass at work with sales and I've been super chatty and funny this evening, my true self really.  Just slightly concerned at what point I'll get sick from the water or if it's necessary with the stimulants. 
Hey	time!	Hey there, lurking from over in rbipolar, but I have a lot of BPD traits and sometimes feel like I've been given the wrong diagnosis.  Anyway, I've recently committed myself to group DBT therapy and I'm both excited and terrified to go.  I've been in a major depression for several months now and severe anxiety is always scratching at the surface.  Has anyone ever tried this before? Could you maybe shed some light on it for me? What am I in for? Thanks ahead of time!
My	life.	My doctor had recommended that I take a break from my meds during the winter break period and since the quarter started this week, I've still been in that mindset of not taking it.  So I tried to remember to take it today, but I totally forgot.  Today in class, it's like I was writing down everything that was written on the board, but I wasn't listening to any of the lecture.   I was so tuned out.  I have everything in my notes, but without looking at them, I have absolutely no idea what we learned today.   It really makes me appreciate how much my meds help me in my daily life.  
All	:(	All in the title.  Please help, I'm pretty certain it's destroying my mouth. On another note, how delicious does dexamfetamine sulphate make cigarettes taste? :(
I	all.	I was recently diagnosed, about a month ago, and have just started to receive accommodations at my university.  I have been seeing a psychologist once a week to work on skills and ways for me to be successful and to understand all the craziness that has been my life so far.  Soon, I will have an appointment to talk about starting meds, but as of now I am feeling pretty good and am just so hopeful that I will be able to turn all of this around and move forward from a better position. Sending out good vibes to all. 
Been	one.	Been diagnosed for about 6 months, explains a lot and feeling much better.  Went to a peer skills group and things have been getting way better, like weirdly better.  My bf and I were log distance for a year (until 5 months ago) and he got close w a female coworker.  It has been a major point of contention and ever since I've moved back they haven't spoken-their messages are deleted and she had never interacted w me.  This response makes me suspicious and anxious but my bf insists nothing is going onhappened.  This chick though keeps liking all of his stuff on social media, like every thing.  Recently he's been deleting messages w her on his (I know, I shouldn't snoop).  He's away for the weekend w his family and has posted a photo, which she has just liked.  I just don't know what to think.  Sorry this is pretty stupid but I'm having a hard time using wisemind for this one. 
I	Peace.	I was sorry to hear the news, I have much respect for this man.  I'm happy he left this world with humility and left us with timeless art and music.    Rest in Peace. 
To	Test	To take the test [click here](http:www. sociotype. comtests)I'm curious which [information elements](http:www. sociotype. comsocionicsinformation_elements) are dominant in people with BPD. If I get a few responses I'd like to see if there's one or two functions out of the eight elements that borderlines excel at.  I'm expecting to see a lot of Extroverted Feeling with Introverted Intuition if I understand the skillset of people with BPD correctly, but I can also see Extroverted Intuition with Introverted Feeling as a possibility.

I	posting	I was a beer drinker.  It always been my preferred drink.  Usually just enjoyed drinking at home out on the back patio in nice weather especially on cool nights like these.  My favorite beer has been a seasonal brew made by Sam Adams called Cold Snap.  So I'm grocery shopping this evening, exhausted, thinking about work, avoiding the beer aisle, when suddenly. . . . there it is. . . a huge display of Cold Snap out in the middle of the grocery store.  My heart flutters for a moment.  Yay! It's out again! Then reality hits.  Oh. . . right. . . I don't drink.  I just stare at the display.  My head hurting and wanting nothing more than to unwind with a cold beer. . . my favorite fucking beer. There's a reason I've been posting
I	there.	I have attempted to quit drinking more times then I care to admit.  At first I did not consider myself an alcoholic.  I just liked the binge drink on a weekly basis.  But with the constant hangovers, saying stupid things to friends and family.  I recognized the problem.  Each time I quit for a day or two the opportunity for free booze presents itself.  Mainly in my career, there is always a seminar with a happy hour to follow.  I found this sub reddit over the weekend and relapsed after 2 days, I had to re-set my badge after a day of finding SD.  I felt shame but I got excited about this journey.  I wasn't sure what to post or what to say.  However, all day today when opportunities to have a beverage with lunch or a quick stop at the kegerator were presented, I hopped on my phone read some quick posts of successes and failures and everything in between and that gives me courage.  Thank you to all of you out there.  
Hi	formatting	Hi rleaves! There's something i'ld like to share with you, that's really helping me at the moment.  It's based on the theory that it takes (roughly) 49 days to break a habit.  It's a simple idea: If you can stick with your daily goal for 49 consecutive days, you have probably ~~formed~~ broken a permanent habit.  Make a card for 7 weeks (7x7 days) put your goal and reasons on it and a big cross for each day you stuck to it.  It started with [this post](https:www. reddit. comrgetdisciplinedcomments1x99m6im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_nocf9dz72).  A very motivating and strong post (read it!).  There's a [sub](https:reddit. comrtheXeffect) now, where you can post a picture of your card on Thursdays (and get motivated) and even a [website](http:www. thexeffect. com), where you can fill your card with digital crosses (one for each day you don't smoke).  It gives me a great feeling to put a big black cross on my card every night, before i go to bed.  Maybe it can help you too to take it one day at a time, remember why you wanted this in the first place and succeed! Good luck, you got this! Edit: formatting
I didn't want any long term med like Zoloft	it didn't help much when I took it in the past	Dr appointed went well today, she gave me a month prescription of Ativan until I got in to see a therapist.  I knew going in  <e1> I didn't want any long term med like Zoloft </e1>  because  <e2> it didn't help much when I took it in the past </e2> . Now at least I have something for situational anxiety to calm me down until I figure out how to cope. 
I	sign.	I do this all the time.   I think it might be a mild manic sign. 
I am glad he did this	it spreads a serious awareness on ADHD to the younger generations	https:youtu. be5GBMS7WPFSs I relate to this video extremely well.  <e1> I am glad he did this </e1>  as  <e2> it spreads a serious awareness on ADHD to the younger generations </e2> .  (Another one I'd like to add is writing a post without being bothered to edit it until after posting it)What he didn't cover is how you deal with these problems.  For example: how do you deal with working in a group. 
I	stir?	I know therapists are required to take action if a client is suicidal.   I'm not suicidal but I'm just so depressed that I can't help but want to talk about how nice it would be not to exist . . .  not to have to worry about anything anymore.   Can I bring this up to her without causing a stir?
Depending on an addictive substance to make you happy	addictions start	Downvote me all you want.  I'm here because of an adderall addiction I've had for four years.  I've seen several posts about adderallstimulate abuse and people taking them to make them happy and they've been abusing them.  Every single post will have a comment saying get a prescription.  Take it how it's prescribed.  I'm sorry but that's horrible advice.  If it was that easy there would be no addicts.   <e1> Depending on an addictive substance to make you happy </e1>  is how  <e2> addictions start </e2> .  I would seriously think anyone who has suffered from an addiction would know that. 
It	out	It hasn't been easy, but it gets better daily. AA won't get you into heaven but it will open the gates of hell and let you out
I'm	control?	I'm sick of being so self-conscious about my nails in public.  My nails and the skin around them look demented.  I can't stop biting though, it happens unconsciously too.  Has anyone gotten rid of this habit, or will it stay as a coping mechanism until I get my anxiety under control?
I didn't had they been washed or no	I put it on just in case	(And DAE?)I know the *basic* basics of laundry.  dark with dark, not too much powder or too hot a cycle, etc.  Symbols on labels mean little to nothing to me but if in doubt, wash at delicate, 30, cold water. There was things in the machine when I came up and  <e1> I didn't had they been washed or no </e1> , so  <e2> I put it on just in case </e2> .  There's also 2 loads, darks and fuck knows what else on the bathroom floor. Mother came home and I said about the load in the machine.  I put that on this morning. You didn't tell me before you left. Well
via pictures explicitly and the things this person shares, disturbs me in the sense	I'm afraid that the person will soon take the next step	HelloI. .  Kind of need help for a friend who seems to be deeply depressed, this person seems to share the thoughts  <e1> via pictures explicitly and the things this person shares, disturbs me in the sense </e1>  that  <e2> I'm afraid that the person will soon take the next step </e2> .  I'm not sure if anyone has seen the picture that was shared around before regarding the subject of beautifying the thought of suicide and someone replies a rather powerful message
Hey	willpower!	Hey leaves.  6 days in here.  My throat is really sore and my nose is getting really plugged up.  Anyone else experience something like this and how long did it take to go away? I've been trying to take cold medication and drink tea and oj, but I can't seem to shake this the past 2 days.  This is really testing my willpower!
I'm	problem?	I'm so quiet and awkward, and I feel very uncomfortable with talking to people one on one.  I don't know if I could open up and really talk, or if I would just wave away my problems.  It would be a waste of both of our time.  But I've heard it helps a lot.  Has anyone had a similar problem?
I found it interesting	I started researching low B12 levels and anxiety	Quick question.  Has anyone used B12folic acid supplements to help with their anxiety? I got bloodwork done last year and that was the only thing I was relatively low in.   <e1> I found it interesting </e1>  once  <e2> I started researching low B12 levels and anxiety </e2> .  Anyone used a certain brand they like? 
I'm	welcome.	I'm trying to keep the most accurate journal but sometimes I don't know why I'm anxious.  Sometimes I have thoughts and then tell myself mentally to not have a compulsion.  Is that a compulsion? I'm confused I wanna do the best I can to beat this but I feel like I'm just not doing it right.  Any help is welcome.  
I'm hesitant as to even if I should listen to the voicemail	it could be a pity partyguilt trip on her part	Long story short, my Nmom has sent me a barrage of texts the past couple weeks asking me how I'm doing, how's my life, etc.  Just today, she texted me asking if we can talk and left me a voicemail.   <e1> I'm hesitant as to even if I should listen to the voicemail </e1>  as  <e2> it could be a pity partyguilt trip on her part </e2> .  Any tips? 
So	time	So since I've posted I've been NC with my parents.   It started with me just not replying to emails and then my Nmom finally sent this email:Last message for today. . . I love ____.  . .  since I laid eyes on him.   I feel like at times I  have a beg to be a part of his life.  I am beyond past what the other grandparents do. .  Don't want you to get angry with me. . . seems like you always are I am a humble Grandparent wanting to spend as much time
I	you?	I figured a lot of these topics I see here are pretty deep and I would love to just see a light hearted discussion if anyone's open to it. So what part of the world are you in? Don't get too specific. . . only share what you feel comfortable with.  I wouldn't go more specific than a major city you're close to.  (I also think Reddit may prohibit sharing any more than that?)Anyway, Tampa, FL here.  What about you?
I've kept to very small amounts	I want to save its efficacy for the actual WD	This is it.  I'm nearly at the end of the taper.  My plan is to skip my pre-lunch dose today, and take a final reduced morning dose tomorrow, then throw out  any remaining kratom in the smelly garbage chute before my commute to work. I've got my supplements ready, and I'm picking up any final supplies I need today (lope, robaxacet). For anyone who didn't see my previous tapering post, I cut down from roughly 30gday to 6-7 over 2 weeks, and have been maintaining it for a week since then.  After tomorrows final morning dose, I'm going CT, and hoping it's easy enough that I don't need to take time off work.  Any encouragement is greatly appreciated! Even though this is only my second post, reading your threads and comments has been a huge inspiration. One question: how does Black Seed Oil effect everyone? I'm finding it gives me a burst of energy, and helps with my muscle aches.   <e1> I've kept to very small amounts </e1>  because  <e2> I want to save its efficacy for the actual WD </e2> . **Update: barely noticed the skipped dose today.  Feeling good that I should be able to get through work tomorrow after a final maintenance dose! Almost there!**
I	alone.	I mean, my paycheck was already fucked up this week.  I work on commission at a high end clothing department store, and literally every single $ 600+ coat I sold before Christmas got returned, so I didn't make my draw this week and got no commission. and I overdrew my bank account by ten bucks cause I wasn't watching my balance so they charged me a $ 25 fee.  my check was so small that the negative $ 35 really fucked me over.  I have no idea how I'm gonna manage to buy groceries and it's entirely my own fault.  I financially support my SO and ahhhh man he's gonna be so upset.  :(I feel like such a dumbass.  I just needed to rant.  I'm glad rADHD is here, haha.  this place makes me feel less alone. 
So,	Help.	So, I normally post on ropiates, but I find posting there is difficult right now.  First day off of suboxone taper, took clonodine, and second day at this house.  It's nice, but I'm so alone.  I live in a big city in the midwest, and they moved me four hours away from there.  I have a non using boyfriend of over four years and a great sponsor back home and I miss them.  I can't relate to anyone here. . . .  I can as far as drug use goes, but other than that. . . .  anyway, I just couldn't take it anymore and wanted to come here for 1-3 months.  You're supposed to commit to a year but can leave at any time.  Well, had to run it by the probation officer and she saw the year thing and told me I have to commit to a year or go to prison.  Welp.  I did want to do this. . .  the year thing is tripping me up.  I've been bored and craving all day.  No one to talk to.  Help. 
the more anxious I am about a task or situation	the more I procrastinate, which makes me more anxious	Hi there, I recently realized that  <e1> the more anxious I am about a task or situation </e1> ,  <e2> the more I procrastinate, which makes me more anxious </e2> , and so on.  This has snowballed into a really big problem that only gets worse, do you guys know of any way to break the cycle? I try to do only ten minutes or something to get into it but usually I'm so worked up about it I stop as soon as the ten minutes are up.  
so	is	so the other night i posted about a friend of mine who my boyfriend found on her bathroom floor with her wrist cut and passed out.  yesterday i got the doctor's verdict.  and im so angry about it.  so, she was on some drug when she did it.  she had barely a surface scratch horizontally on her wrist, so she wasnt passed out from pain or bloodloss.  she woke up pissed to hell in the hospital.  i dont know what went on there, i do care to find out but its not my business.  the doctors decided to put her in the outpatient program.  out.  patient.  she self harmed on drugs, and is generally destructive to herself and those around around her.  that makes me so angry to think about.  she was supposed to be in some form of in patient program in my opinion.  not for my feelings about her, to be honest i barely cared about her until i realized she was like this.  i just used the word friend to be simple.  i've been in in-patient a few times.  i know how big a wake up call it is
I	journey?	I have smoked since i was a teenager, steady pack a day.   Have never really wanted to quit until now and suddenly believe it's possible.   I find the morning cig with coffee and the after lunch after dinner cigs are the hardest ones for me to not want.   Any immediate hints, tips, tricks for starting this journey?
I'm	breathe.	I'm freaking out and no one is here for me I just need company so I don't. . I don't knowsomething happened and my paranoia and panic is through the roof. . . if anyone has time? I don't know I just need . . . someone here? to keep me grounded I don't know.  I'm not going to hurt myself but I'm crying and can't breathe.  
Is it worth it to keep trying	some days the suffering is just too intense	But suddenly I'm not.  Fought with my husband for no reason, feeling fat, ugly, repulsive, worthless, again.  Also sort of having an affair and freaked out with the other guy too, although via text so it wasn't as harsh (and he is much nicer than husband).  So sad right now.  I keep thinking that it is too much work to try to fix all this shit.  Nobody will ever love me - I can have 100 guys and still won't feel loved, ever.  I don't even know what it is supposed to feel like.   <e1> Is it worth it to keep trying </e1> ? Because  <e2> some days the suffering is just too intense </e2> .  Thanks for listening.  Questions are sort of rhetorical but I don't mind actual feedback.  Not going to kill myself today - too much work pending this week and I have a very strong work ethic. 
Hey	conversations.	Hey there.  I'm 32, struggling with ADD, and looking for others who are facing the same kinds of challenges.  I'm holding down an office job, but don't fit in there.  I'm working to meet people and try to make friends in a large city, with little success.  And I'm going to therapy and learning communication skills - albeit slowly. I don't know if there's an IRC group dedicated to this age bracket, and maybe I'm limiting myself with that - it just seems that Reddit skews younger a lot of the time, and I'm curious to learn more about how older people are dealing with ADD. I guess I'm just looking to connect with some others, share some conversations. 
Hey	category	Hey all, So I just went to the pharmacy to get my first vyvanse refill of the new year, and was shocked to find out that they now want $ 100 a month for it--and that's with insurance!it wasn't exactly cheap before, at $ 60 a month, but that was at least manageable.  BCBS has moved it to a tier three category
2	already.	2 weeks in, and I'm already fucking myself.   Every night I tell myself I'm going to change tomorrow, go to class, email professors, do my work, blah blah.   Yet I never do.  I skip class because I skipped last class without telling professors why.   It's a viscous cycle that is my downfall every semester. I'm on academic probation, and if I don't do well I will get kicked out.  Should I just tell my professors the truth? That I'm insane and depressed and self destructive, but want to start over and catch up and pass??Or should I make excuses, lie, and make up the work and try to pass?  Please send advice if you have it, I'm breaking down over fucking schoolwork and feel pathetic.  I feel like it's too late already. 
I wanted to join the police	I wanted to save people's lives and whatnot	I mean, I have friends, and I don't really have any interest in a romantic life.  I'm an 18 year old with a steady income and joining the police force sometime this year.  When  <e1> I wanted to join the police </e1>  I felt that  <e2> I wanted to save people's lives and whatnot </e2> .  But these days I feel like there's no point.  People will die, and so will I.  Nothing really feels like it matters.  
after stopping drunking abruptly, following an extended amount of time drinking heavy	I had an enormous sex drive all of a sudden	There's a lot of scientific evidence available about this subject.  But it's a subject I [first researched] because I actually noticed a profound affect on Testosterone, especially after having, say, a whole months' session of drinking morning to night.  According to some research articles chronic heavy drinking can lead to a boosting of something called an 'aromatase enzyme', which work by covert T into oestrogen . . .  nice, NOT! In my own experience, I have [many times] noticed,  <e1> after stopping drunking abruptly, following an extended amount of time drinking heavy </e1> : that  <e2> I had an enormous sex drive all of a sudden </e2>  . . .  and would find myself desperately trying to repair the relationship 'damage' done by my selfish actions of being drunk for a week, or three, to my girlfriend, who would be totally angry with me! Has anyone else also experienced this [seemingly] rapid surge of testosterone level back in your system, after stopping drinking abruptly, followin a big bender? And also does anyone know if the damage done to T levels during drinking, gradually become irreparable? I recently had my T results come back pretty low, but not low enough to warrant TRT unfortunately.  Any comment greatly appreciated
I have a small penis	I get sad and it's coming to a point where I say I'd rather be dead	I am a 49 year old black man who's not like were all perceived to be downstairs, in other words,  <e1> I have a small penis </e1> .  Don't get me wrong, my ex girlfriend never complained, and I've had many good sexual situations but the last relationship I had, she told me flat out she preferred big ones and a lot of times ED would kick in but I think that was due to my self consciousness but thank god for cialis.  But I always felt that she'd be thinking of one of her past lovers while we were in the moment.  Right now I'm not in a relationship but every time I look down at my little penis,  <e2> I get sad and it's coming to a point where I say I'd rather be dead </e2> .  If anyone out there could relate to this, please help please.  I'm really bummed out because of this. 
The	myself	The pain of staying alive is greater than the unknown pain I might feel by doing this.  I just can't go on anymore. Edit: 500mg pills, not 50mg. Edit 2: still here, decided before reading this to maybe wait until Saturday, but now I feel I need to change my approach entirely.  I mostly thought the alcohol would help calm me and put me to sleep while the pills did their job but it seems I'm gravely mistaken.  I've been battling depression for more than half my life, I just can't handle myself
Ugh.	tonight.	Ugh.  There's just so much I need to deal with and I HAVEN'T been.  I need someone to talk to who won't immediately lose interest and stop responding.  Been thinking of taking the plunge and actually attending AA finally but I'm so goddamn terrified to take that step and expose who I am and what I've been doing.  I'm still relatively young, healthy, active and fairly integrated in my social circles, but I also feel incredible detached and apathetic overall.  I want to overcome this seamlessly with out it being such a big deal to the rest of the world around me. Here I am checking in again as this busy ass single mom laying tiredly on the couch and out of any and all booze, save for a bottle of dealcoholized champagne I was planning on cracking open once I completed dry January.  Evidently that was another colossal failure.  Anyway, I won't drink tonight. 
I have smoked since I was 16, I did quit for 6 years when I became a smoking cessation officer	I didn't wanna be a hypocrite	 <e1> I have smoked since I was 16, I did quit for 6 years when I became a smoking cessation officer </e1>  as  <e2> I didn't wanna be a hypocrite </e2> .   I moved to Australia nearly 3 years ago and started smoking again - Today, I randomly decided it was time again.   I am doing what I know is best for me and worked last time, cold turkey.  No patchesguminhalators.   Wish me luck!!
zone out, wolf down food and subsequently having nearly pass out	a lack of oxygen	Anyone else tend to  <e1> zone out, wolf down food and subsequently having nearly pass out </e1>  due to  <e2> a lack of oxygen </e2> ?I've been doing this for about a decade now and can't seem to learn from my experience. 
I may have misophonia	now I feel OK that certain sounds bother me and I'm not sensitive or crazy	I'm going to start paying more attention to neurology and brain differences.  It appears that people with mirror touch synesthesia have less grey matter in the corresponding area of their brain.  Speaking of brain stuff, a year or so ago I also figured out that  <e1> I may have misophonia </e1> , at least to a degree after a friend described it.  So  <e2> now I feel OK that certain sounds bother me and I'm not sensitive or crazy </e2> .  It's just nice to be reminded that we're evolving as a species and we get wired differently as stuff happens whether it's genetic
This matches my own experience	I'll toss the question out	Hey everyone,I'd asked a question yesterday about how people would describe anxiety, and got a lot of great feedback.  Just about everyone says they know full-well their fears are unfounded.  <e1> This matches my own experience </e1> , so  <e2> I'll toss the question out </e2> : If we know our fears are unfounded, then what are we really afraid of?Thinking about this myself, I've come to realize it's generally not the thing itself (flying, driving, social situations) I'm uncomfortable with.  It's the fear that I'll suddenly find myself experiencing fear, and be judged for that fear. It's the fear of having to try and explain my irrational fears. Put another way, if we were living in a world where it was totally normal to suddenly have a panic attack on an airplane -- like 7 out of 10 people did it, and no one even took notice of it anymore -- then I seriously think knowing I wouldn't be scrutinized would allay 90% of the anxiety I faced. It seems it's not fear of an irrational thing.  It's fear of being scrutinized for fear of an irrational thing. Can anyone relate to this? Or would I be overgeneralizing to say that this may be at the heart of anxiety?
its my own fault	not accepting I needed help when I had the chance	So I finally asked for accommodations.  I had to fail one class and almost fail the same class when I repeated it because hate getting that damn letter.  Does anyone else struggle with doing this?I know its irrational.  I work with students myself  and I would never look down on a kid for using accommodations.  But for some reason when I have to do it its hard not the feel embarrassed.  It makes me feel like a little kid with mittens pinned to my jacket. Its just the last couple of classes his happened in, I really liked the material and the teachers and I sucks for them to thinks Im a lazy space cadet.  But  <e1> its my own fault </e1>  for  <e2> not accepting I needed help when I had the chance </e2> . Anyone else ever in this place?
I'm	you.	I'm grateful to still have my loved ones.  I'm grateful for sour patch kids and sparkling water.  I'm grateful to wake up proud.  I'm grateful for my memory, energy, and cognitive function to be healing.  I'm grateful to have a room within walking distance that is open at 11pm everyday, and that is accepting and not in a basement.   I'm grateful to be getting tired earlier everyday on my own.  I'm grateful for you guys and to still be here with you.  I'll be here not drinking with you.  
I	useless?	I want to learn how to draw, but I have no motivation.  I want to learn how to code, but I have no motivation.  I want to learn how to make music. , but I have no motivation.  And whenever I look at some nice looking art, a cool looking game, or I remember that Madeon basically started his career when he was 16, I always get sad as well.  Sure, I'm only 16.  I have a long journey ahead of me.  But why can't that journey start now? Why can't I have an early start on something and be amazing at it by the time I'm 20.  Why am I so useless?

Fuuuuuuuuuuck.	up.	Fuuuuuuuuuuck.   Why can't I just get excited like a regular person?  Why can't I just be a little bummed out when the unexpected happens? Why do I have to go full tilt with joy and anger and sadness?  It's nice when things are going well, but damn if life isn't all kinds of fucked up. 
I get all the sims side effects	I had with a higher dosage	I'm on 36mg of Concerta twice a day.  This dosage has been great for 2 months now.  I live in Norway, and so far it's been pretty dark for the last few months.  But yesterday the sun came back and it's also pretty bright today.  I've always felt fantastic during the first weeks with warm sunshine but now I'm finding that my dosage is too high.   <e1> I get all the sims side effects </e1>  as  <e2> I had with a higher dosage </e2> .  Is this caused by my happy feels and is this something you all adjust for? I've only been on stimulants for 9ish months so this is all a bit confusing.  Male 31 btw.  If that matters.  
But	xanax??	But im afraid he'll revoke my Ritalin script thinking it's causing the anxiety.   It's not, and it works perfect, so I dont want to mess that up, but I could really use something for social gatherings or work meetingsevents.   Is it common to get both scripts?  Should I see a separate doctor all together for the xanax??
hey	shit	hey guys.  so over a few years, my mom has been driving me insane by having horrible. . .  tantrums i guess you could cal it.  evry times this has happened (its been happening like every 2-3 days or so) i have thoughts off killing myself or killing my mom (but i wonr, i wouldnt ever do those things.  just thoughts of mine), and i wasnt my parents to divorce.  today i was finally pushed too far and i just came home locked myself in my room, went on my laptop and cried.  did not eat dinner and dont feel like going to school.  i even had to write down i want my parents to divorce i hate my mom i want to kill her i want to suicide my room and messy and there is shit everywhere.  am i depressed or is just a thing that wil go away when i move outdorm (im 14) ive had thoughts of talking to my guidance counsler or calling child services r some shit
I've	Millennials	I've been working on my many noggin problems for as long as I can remember (at least when I had health insurance. . . )Presently reading a book, and had been feeling super excited -- seemed to be speaking directly to my problems and have some realistic approaches. . . And then the author casually tosses out that dreaded E-word:**Entitlement**Specifically as applied to younger generation (code for Millennials
I'm	.	I'm probably going to get shit for this but I feel like here and in the media mainly, people who suffer  with ADHD are seen as crazy kids who can't sit still and very annoying.  I feel like PI gets little to no attention as it might be ''boring''.  First I should say that I have ADHD-PH friends and I just sometimes feel really annoyed with them.  Any PI sufferers feel the same way? Do you feel like PI is absolutely terrible yet it gets no attention and is seen as lazy.  Also, I had another great qeustion to go along with this but I forgot it, fuck.  Another side note - - Do any sufferers feel like their head weighs a ton from all the daydreaming.  I'm not sure how to describe the feeling but it's like an enormous physical pressure in my head always there. . . 
I	today.	I just wanted to send this message out there, into the world. I have done a lot to be ashamed of, but I've also done a lot to be proud of.  We all take it one day at a time, and if we can make it to the end of the day without a drink in our hand and with compassion in our hearts, I think that's a monumental thing worth celebrating. I will not drink today. 
I	man.	I was taking a lovely bath when Nmom has to take a shit, can't wait she says.  She comes in, brings in a small space heater so she's not cold, DOESN'T open the window because she doesn't want to be cold, takes shit. She left but only opened the window 4 inches. The bathroom smells like shit.  Bath ruined, I'm typing this right now trying not to inhale. Fuck everything, man. 
I drank	I was completely disengaged with life	Prey passes the tiger whoSometimes merely looks,Sometimes pounces without hesitation,But never fails to act. **My Take:**When  <e1> I drank </e1> ,  <e2> I was completely disengaged with life </e2> .   That bottle was all that mattered, and my life revolved around it.   Now, sober and alert, it's almost sensory overload.   I feel the need to pounce on everything.    Not in a violent way.   I mean I feel the need to somehow deal with everything that comes my way. I need to learn to let some things pass

And it's only been the second night that she's been home. My spineless brute of a father hasn't been doing anything but feeding into her delusions and supporting her.  He just put down $ 4,000 getting a certain adjustment done to the house because she couldn't handle the heat (it's finally summer in the southern semi-sphere).  HER SECOND DAY ONLY.  4 grand already!Immediately when my father and I picked her up from the airport she wants to talk about my life.  She firstly addressed my hair cut saying it made me look fatter and my face fatter (well you're no supermodel yourself you obese she beast)
I	time?	I started battling anxiety (or so atleast I have been told) about 3 months ago.  Parts of my face feel numb, but aren't numb.  Specially under my eyes where the sinus cavities are located.  I have been to an ENT and am waiting for more information on my sinus issues.  When I told him my issues he didn't seem concerned but I sometimes feel that doctors downplay symptoms to anxiety (could be the anxiety talking).  But yeah, can you be in a continuous anxious state? Like days at a time? 
I really want to be more social	I noticed it's been something I've been neglecting ever since starting medication	So I was just prescribed 20 mg Prozac and 5mg adderall as a booster on top of my 40mg vyvanse I take in the morning.  Just wondering how prozac will make me feel; vyvanse gives me social anxiety and anxiety in general.  Will this make me feel more social and happy or more relaxed or all of them?  <e1> I really want to be more social </e1>  because  <e2> I noticed it's been something I've been neglecting ever since starting medication </e2> . 
I'm	this?	I'm not scared of an afterlife, nor a lack thereof.  But I'm scared of it hurting.  I'm scared of it failing.  I'm scared of waking up in hospital.  I'm scared of living post-attempt, disabled and with everyone disappointed in me.  Does anyone else feel like this? 
The	slump?	The last couple weeks I've been up and down a lot.  Mostly down.  Stressed, fearful, hopeless.  Then I'll have a random good day and be really up and the future's grand.  Then back down.  It's hard to tell how much of it is the alcohol though.  Life is pretty up in the air right now generally.  Any other people experiencing a ~28-35 day slump?

I'm really freaking out guys	one side of my chin has a rounded, smooth bump on it	 <e1> I'm really freaking out guys </e1> .   I'm in therapy and I have a combination of OCD and GAD but I don't see my therapist for a while. I noticed that I felt a pain near my chin, the kind of pain I normally get when a pimple is about to erupt.   i started feeling around and I noticed that  <e2> one side of my chin has a rounded, smooth bump on it </e2> - almost like part of the chin bone.   I can't move it, and I can't tell if it's related to the pain (pain feels more like acne pain).   I guess it's possible that my chin is just slightly asymmetrical, but I'm really worried it could be cancer that would cause my chin bone to be removed.   I found other people online with this issue, but none of them posted followup about what the lump was.   I have a history of cystic acne, but cystic acne feels like. . . acne, not like part of your bone.   I'm so terrified.   Please help. 
Tonight	guys	Tonight im going to follow through with my plan.  Ive warned several people for months now and no one is trying to stop me.  and I mean really warned like for months Ive been telling people around me that I am going through with it one of these days and they took it as nothing.  But now im doing it.  finally.  fucking finally im putting myself out of my misery.  Im gathering all my things in this house putting them in trash bags throwing them in my car so no one has to deal with gathering my shit and im driving far away.  to a nice big tree where I will climb to my resting place.  Goodbye, oh cruel,greedy, disgusting war driven world! Have fun with your happy and successful lives with your money and all your good happy things! :)Update: Hey guys

Title	on.	Title says it all.  She was all I had, everything else I've burned to the ground.  She has been my rock in my low times.  Now I'm hungry, moving in with my parents, broke, 0 self esteem and want a reason to live.  Somebody tell me it gets better. I shoot up heroin or any other opiates I can get my hands on. 
Hello,Time	inconclusive	Hello,Time to stop denying; I have a serious problem with diet soda.  I drink at least two cans a day and on some days I easily down a whole bottle of the stuff. I've been telling myself that it doesn't really matter since diet soda doesn't have calories and the science is inconclusive
my anxiety doesn't scare me as much	I know it can't hurt me	In two weeks I'll be one year smoke free.  Seshing had a really big impact on my life, specifically with my anxiety.  I would wake up, rip 3 or 4 bowls and be at a [7] by lunch every single day.  Then I would stay up until I lost count of bowls, again every single day. But now I'm a full year away from this.  And if I can be quite honest due to my anxiety quitting really wasn't all that difficult for me.  No I just want to be able to go back to when I first started smoking when it was at a party once or twice a month surrounded by friends. Does anyone here have any experience with this? Sure I'm a little anxious that it may induce some anxiety but after dealing with that for quite some time now even  <e1> my anxiety doesn't scare me as much </e1> , because  <e2> I know it can't hurt me </e2> . Any input on this would be much appreciated!
I	Okay	I don't really know how to explain this properly.  I'm 15, a guy, and a freshman in high school.  When I'm at school, I am always very happy and nice to people.  I do have quite a few friends that I like to be around, and they feel the same way about me.  I laugh at the smallest things, and I feel like nothing can make me feel bad about myself.  While I'm at school, I think Okay
King	are	King Soloman requested a ring that could make a sad man happy and a happy man sad.  His servant left and returned to him with a ring.  The king smiled and took it.  He inspected it then frowned.  On the ring was inscribed Even this shall pass.  Meaning no matter how happy or how sad you are
its been like 100 hours since the last cigarette , but im scared of this craving	im afraid that it will never gone	 <e1> its been like 100 hours since the last cigarette , but im scared of this craving </e1> ,   <e2> im afraid that it will never gone </e2> .  is this craving will stops after certain point ? 
I'm kind of glad this doesn't last	I can see it becoming really annoying to me and everyone around me	Finally, 6 weeks in, I am in the pink cloud.   Energy is off the charts, mood is euphoric and I just want to hug everyone.   Yesterday I was listening to ABBA on my earphones at my desk and it almost killed me to not be dancing around the office - had to go for a long walk and run the stairs so I could stand still and work.    <e1> I'm kind of glad this doesn't last </e1>  as  <e2> I can see it becoming really annoying to me and everyone around me </e2> .   In the meantime, look out house, you are getting a scrubbing this weekend!  I may even break out the running shoes or bike shorts - woo hoo!
I am so proud of myself	handling midterms and not caving	Day 3 of no smoking!  <e1> I am so proud of myself </e1>  for  <e2> handling midterms and not caving </e2> .  BUT tonight there is a huge party at my house. .  wish me luck!
I can't guarantee it will get done simply	my don't feel like it attitude	I think I've finally figured out my issue with homework.  It's not that I really forget to do it.  A lot of times, I know damned well that I have it.  For example, I have a bunch of work I need to get done this weekend, like reading for brit lit, studying for a calculus test, etc.  but  <e1> I can't guarantee it will get done simply </e1>  because of  <e2> my don't feel like it attitude </e2> .  A lot of times I sit down and think
I'm	Although	I'm 16, my parents have a pretty dysfunctional relationship and their behavior has really made me estrange them.  My father had a bad childhood, his mom was an angry woman.  As a kid, I simply thought he was scary and pissed off but now that I'm older, I realize he's an emotionally immature low-life.  He blames everyone and plays the victim.  He's a chronic complainer.  I can't call him my dad anymore.  I don't blame him for his childhood, but he should've be responsible for his emotional issues a long time ago.  My mom is okay, I still call her mom.  Even as a kid she would nag me to the point where I snap and said OKAY!!.  Although
I take it right before bed to sleep through the nausea	I woke up in the night worrying and obsessing about something that I don't worry about during day time	I thought this would be interesting for some of you.  I usually tske my strattera with lunch or dinner, but sometimes I forget and then  <e1> I take it right before bed to sleep through the nausea </e1>  (which usually happens if I don't take the pill on a full stomach).  I noticed that whenever I did this,   <e2> I woke up in the night worrying and obsessing about something that I don't worry about during day time </e2> .  After 10-20 minutes of tossing and turning I fall asleep again.  As I use an app to monitor my sleep, it was pretty easy to see that theese anxiety attacks happen usually 4 hours after taking the pill.  The anxiety is not really bad,  but still strong enough to wake me up.  Most probably I experience a similar low during the day when I take my pill with lunch,  but I had been blaming it on the daily stress.  Now I know better,  breathe deep,  and know that it will pass.  Anyone else experiencing something similar? 
My	it	My life is going no where, there's a big bridge down the road from me and I have constant thoughts of jumping off it
Edit:	bargain	Edit: I live in a border town and can cross and get the same medicine or similar in generic form for much cheaperthe dollar is 17 pesos so this is a bargain 
life is so much better	without those awful cigarettes	So 9 days people, 9 days :D I am so proud of myself.  I went to the cinema yesterday and after the movie people outside lit up and I was wondering why I wasn't doing the same, but then I remembered why.  Keep going people,  <e1> life is so much better </e1>   <e2> without those awful cigarettes </e2> .  
After	Whoop!	After reading numerous accounts of people smoking in their dreams, I had my first taste and it was a wild experience.  I felt guilt, shame, disappointment in myself and other emotions I don't usually associate with dreaming.  Also I was surrounded by everyone who knows I have recently quit and they were all giving me dirty looks. . .  whew was I glad to wake up feeling great and still being smoke free for 15 days, Whoop!
being triggered	causes a more abrupt shift	There are times when my mood seems to shift even without being triggered, like a larger overarching change, although  <e1> being triggered </e1>  definitely  <e2> causes a more abrupt shift </e2> .  For example, last December and this January were spent in a generally more depressed, low, numb state, with sexual desire being little to none.  In the past few weeks, however, I've noticed a greater shift.  While I've had a few crying jags from BPD triggers, I've generally been more high, impulsive, sexual and overall more hyper and bubblier.  I definitely don't think it's enough to qualify as Bipolar I or II, so could it be cyclothymia? Or is it just a regular BPD thing? I've finally made an appointment with a psychiatrist for next week, so I guess I'll get my answer then, but until then I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience.  I'm also honestly kind of worried that being put on medication will make me lose the high.  I want to be high ALL THE TIME and never be low but that would probably be crazy.  Ugh. 
I'm	handle	I'm having some money stresses at the moment, nothing I can't ultimately take care of, but enough to be stressful.  My gf spotted I was acting unusually, so she pressed me to tell her what was wrong.  I ended up telling her about the problem, and mentioning that it was made worse by her continually talking about spending more and more money on things.  All she took from it was that I thought she was going on about spending.  Then I broke down, and she told me to tell her what I was feeling.  Problem being, if I say anything's wrong that involves her, she immediately shuts it down saying she's prepared to listen, but not to be attacked.  If I say anything that *doesn't* involve her, she tells me which flaw of mine it is she thinks is the cause.  If I react in any way to *that* she accuses me of flying off the handle
I	suffocating.	I think I have a few weeks a year where I feel alright.  I feel either dry, cold, and too 'sharp', or hot, sweaty, and suffocated.  I have the humidifier on constantly in the winter and get tense otherwise.  In the summer I just feel like everyone's staring at me being chubby, sweaty, and nervous, and I could literally melt at any given time.   Basically, dry air and cold exacerbate my anxious symptoms, but hot moist air makes me feel like I'm suffocating. 
It's almost like they need be to be the most depressed and suicidal	if I wasn't people might notice they are miserable	 <e1> It's almost like they need be to be the most depressed and suicidal </e1>  because  <e2> if I wasn't people might notice they are miserable </e2> .  Either that or everyone hates me.  But I guarantee not as much as I hate them.   I've told everyone for a week Friday is a big day for me(first date in I don't even know a long time) and I need someone to help me register this car(give me a ride, help me pick it up. ) All week lies.  I guess they need to see for themselves themselves that a belt around your neck doesn't lie either. 
Has	relieved	Has anyone successfully let go of their repressed anger? I'm talking about the one that I've held in my unconscious for many years, that gets triggered whenever my mum does something, that makes me want to do bad things to her, that makes it impossible for me to calm down for a few hours, the one that destroys the inside of me, the one that causes depression and anxiety. And please no cop-out answers like exercising andor meditation.  I do do both of them and they are helpful, but they are temporary, are a tool to aid the problem, but do not tackle the source of the problem.  I've also tried journalling  writing a letter, which does let go of the anger and I do feel relieved
Born to a psychotic immigrant	exhibiting suicidal tendecies	Im almost 28.  Medical student, on off time.  Soon not to be a medical student.   <e1> Born to a psychotic immigrant </e1> , now  <e2> exhibiting suicidal tendecies </e2> .  Mother feeds off my pain.  Like listening to Sufjan Stevens because I understand his lyrics on his album Carrie ; Lowell.  Experiancing heavy burdens, crying often.  Keep calling crisis lines.  Hearing voices, too depressed to relax.  No one understands. Life is a tragic comedy,  there isn't laughter  coming from you if you're the joke. 
I exhibit many symptoms of ADHD	the anecdotes I have read here as well as some other research	Hello all.   <e1> I exhibit many symptoms of ADHD </e1> , judging by  <e2> the anecdotes I have read here as well as some other research </e2> .  On top of that my doctor diagnosed me with mild ADD in high school, but I am a college student now and have found symptoms have been getting worse.  Maybe this is the wrong sub since it was ADD, but I know that treatment wise they are similar beasts.  Anyways, I am worried about bringing this up to my new doctor whom I will be seeing for the first time.  I am afraid she will assume I am just looking for stimulants.  Honestly I am open to any and all treatments suggested by a professional but seeing as this is my first time visiting her and I am in college, I am worried that she will brush my concerns off.  Is it typical for me to run into such problems? Also, are there any non-medication methods of coping?
I'm	appreciated.	I'm moving across the country (Canada) at the end of next month, and my BF and I are flying with our two cats on a 5-6 hour flight.  I am already so stressed out about this situation, and am worried about our 2 10 yr old (fussy) cats, but it is what it is.  I'm recently diagnosed (like a 45 days ago) and I currently take 36mg of concerta, but will likely be bumped up to 54 next week.  I've only ever taken a day off meds once when I was sick in bed.  I'm just wondering if the stress of this day will be exacerbated by medication (which sometimes makes me a bit jittery when I'm stressed) or if it will be helpful for decision making, dealing with problems if they arise, etc.  My meds can make me calmer and more reasonable too, but I just don't know.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  
I had my first ketamine infusion on Wednesday	feel significantly better	 <e1> I had my first ketamine infusion on Wednesday </e1>  and  <e2> feel significantly better </e2> .  I know it doesn't work for everyone but if you are treatment resistant like me and suffering I highly recommend.   To have immediate improvement after 9 months down is a very good thing.  On to more infusions next week.  Be well everyone.  
Visiting the personal finance subreddit	retirement	 <e1> Visiting the personal finance subreddit  </e1> freaks me out for one reason:  <e2> retirement </e2> .  Great subreddit, great advice, but it makes me terrified for my future.  I can't afford to put several hundreds of dollars a month into my 401k.  I'm 30 years old and I put what I can, but it's probably not enough.  Anxiety makes it difficult for me to realize that as I continue in life, chances are mymy husband's income will grow.  It's silly to think we will be sitting where we are now for the rest of our lives.  I've come a long way in 5 years, as has my husband.  But for some reason when I think of retirement age, I can't seem to make the anxious part of me realize that we will grow.  
This	you.	This simple thank you goes out to the unsung heroes who were there for the people who were feeling unloved and unlovable during the many moments in their lives.  Thank you for seeing through the walls that people put up to protect themselves from pain, betrayal and despair but all the while pushing themselves away from the love, trust and kindness that they had sought but lost from unkindness, thinking they are undeserving of that which they needed all along.  Thank you for being there for those who dwell in loneliness, sadness and suffering not from choice but sometimes through unfortunate happenstances or from being misunderstood, neglected, and abandoned. Thank you for encouraging and giving people the hope they needed to see themselves as real people again. Thank you for being there to shine a ray of light for people who courageously lived in a bitter world where they thought darkness, sadness and hopelessness were perhaps their only companions. Thank you for making a difference and showing the world that it not be a dark and cruel place, that people can really care for each other as real individuals and that everyone matters. Thank you.

I	this?	I can't stand this.   I returned her call in the middle of the work day, a time when I'm usually bored and getting tired.  I guess that was evident in my voice, and it apparently was a huge indication that I'm ungrateful and spoiled.  Growing up, if I had the wrong tone or made the wrong facial expression (you know, the thing you can't control), I usually got an interrogation and lecture after.  She asks me what's wrong, and why am I talking like that.  I never understood why she's so hostile over nothing.  Is there any wonder why I'm a timid adult who says i'm sorry way too much?DAE go through this? 
it would go away	I'm still young	For the last year or two this question has been in the back of my mind.  I have been going through this phase where i have no motivation do anything and have no real inner fire.  I thought  <e1> it would go away </e1>  because  <e2> I'm still young </e2>  (18) but it's been a while now.  I wouldn't say i'm sad but its more the vibe to everything is flat.  I have quite a lot of things in my life that are going well.  First year at uni
I quit smoking cold turkey last week	everything has been going fine	 <e1> I quit smoking cold turkey last week </e1>  and  <e2> everything has been going fine </e2> .  But these past couple of days I've been really irritable, I'll get upset over the littlest things.  I don't really have a craving for a cigarette but I would like to be back to my normal self. 
I've	alone.	I've spent the last 6 years alone.     I have no one to hug and love.    No one to talk about my feelings with.    Every night I have dreams about someone dating/loving me.    Then I wake up; back to reality.    I used to be joyful, and people enjoyed being around me.    Over time, my depression took away a friendly appearance.     You look like you want to be left alone. 
So	haha	So after posting a few times about the upcoming Friday office drinks today, I've just been struck down with my first ever nasty migraine.  Not sure whether to be thankful or not haha
I have this horrible feeling of I'm existing too hard	I have annoyed everybody around me	Every time I am around people I feel like I am the most irritating person, I can't stop myself talking.      <e1> I have this horrible feeling of I'm existing too hard </e1>  and it always happens after  <e2> I have annoyed everybody around me </e2> .

I	luck!	I keep saying every day that I'm going to get up and get going and accomplish one specific goal, but I never do.  Yesterday, I got 1/4 of the way there.

I need to clean my room	they won't judge me when I kill myself	Hi everyone,   I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was around 13, and I'm 19 now.

Hello	many	Hello , I posted about my food addiction a few weeks ago, and I was pretty miserable then.  Since then, I've found a program for me that is focused on the *addictiveness* of eating flour and sugar and trying to break that addiction, and not on weight loss.   Today is my first day of eating non-addictively (an abstinent day).  Hopefully there will be many

We were testing out a  SA skype chat and some really cool people joined :D If you're worried about being too awkward, don't worry there is no such thing! Haha and the best part is that everyone is so understanding about struggles of not fitting in that we all do our best to really trying to make everyone feel inclusive.  It's a pretty cool atmosphere! Add me on skype and I can add you into the group! Brittanyj101  And the topics that we talk about are some times so random that it's great. 
Does	hours	Does anyone else feel like their period exacerbates their depression? Obviously I am still a suicidal piece of shit all month long, but sometimes I feel like I am much worse when I'm on my period.  I've also gone through periods just fine, but some of them are awful.  Do you think there's a biological basis for this, like some fucked up hormonal thing that makes me feel even more awful than usual? Or just an unsurprising side effect of one of my organs literally coming out of my body and being in excruciating pain for a straight 48 hours
I	myself	I just feel really down about myself and really fucking embarrassed lately and it really makes me want to off myself
am not sure if his drinking is even that much of an issue	he seems to be doing fine otherwise	He drinks every day, but he doesn't get wasted every day.  Usually just beer or wine, or liquor in his coffee.  He admits that he might be drinking too much, but he believes it hasn't been negatively affecting his life.  I care about him, but  <e1> am not sure if his drinking is even that much of an issue </e1>  because  <e2> he seems to be doing fine otherwise </e2> .  As a heavy pot smoker, I know what it's like to need a vice, but I don't want to sit by and watch him hurt himself if it is more of an issue than him and I have been making it to be.  If it is a problem, how should I approach it?  TL;DR he drinks quite a bit, but it doesn't appear to be an issue and I'm not sure if I should be worried or not. 
i dont want to be this kind of '' me ''	i feel i lost my real self a long time ago	at this point i have no clue what to do.  i never felt rested out at some point of my life and everytime i had time to rest i come home to more fight and drama and at the end when i want to be mad or angry or sad i get told to just get a grip of myself and at the end i will get blamed for not even the mistakes i made.    i tried to be honest with myself and wanted to be myself but everywhere i look i see lies and hatred  and i helped people but when i needed help i was left alone.    as much as i tried to help others i couldnt help myself.     i am tired of trying and trying and failing with as reward punishments    <e1> i dont want to be this kind of '' me '' </e1>  since  <e2> i feel i lost my real self a long time ago </e2>  when i stepped intro depression and no medical care seemed to help and i dont want to live like this '' me ''
Called in sick on Monday	I was hungover	So I didn't drink Friday or saturday.  After company left sunday, I decided to have one drink to calm down/relax.  After that, I kept drinking and drinking and drinking.  Apparently I was a complete asshole to my boyfriend.  I don't remember any of it.  But wait, that's not the end of it.   <e1> Called in sick on Monday </e1>  cause  <e2> I was hungover </e2> .  Started drinking after I called in which was about 6:30am.  Gross, I know.  Drank all day again.  Blacked out again.  Called in again today.  Feel like shit.  This is what happens when I drink.  I cannot drink.  Day 1, again
Two	drink	Two days ago I drank.  And I didn't just drink, I drank until I was blackout, off-my-rocker, drunk.  I called and texted my ex repeatedly until he came and picked my sorry self up at the bar.  I spent the night talking to people who's faces I can't even remember.  The only thing I remember is that when I was walking from my ex's car to the house, I fell.  That's it.  The rest of the night is gone.  I am so embarrassed, ashamed and bewildered by what happened.  It was like a switch in my brain just turned on and I said I'm going to drink tonight and I did.  I didn't even challenge the thoughts.  And I didn't *just* drink
used	Like	used to be pretty depressed as a child/teenager.  Went away a few years ago.  Life has been A LOT better.   Well, the problem is the thoughts came back, but in a more serious way.  It feels like I could actually go through with it.  Although, I don't get sad and emotional, I don't get the thoughts of fuck everything this time.  It just feels more real when I have the thoughts now.   Like
making a move with my career	do a lot of public speaking in front of peers	Hi guys, I'm planning on  <e1> making a move with my career </e1>  and it would cause me to  <e2> do a lot of public speaking in front of peers </e2> .  I'm a teacher now, and used to speaking in front of kids, and having adults in and out of my room, but this is going to be a lot more stressful.  I know I will grow as a person if I do this, and no guarantees that I will get it.  Any tips on faking it, to look like I'm more comfortable in front of the groups. . . .  while I adjust, supposing I got it of course.  Part of the interview is a group lesson to adults.  I know I can rock the content part, just don't want to look like a cherry tomato with a shaky voice and lots of ums.  How do I fake confidence
not willing to go to 108	I feel it wont help	Hi reddit, so to start i've recently started concerta upping my dose from 18 to 90mg.  the only dose to really have some effect on my focus so far has been between 54-90mg  <e1> not willing to go to 108 </e1>  as  <e2> I feel it wont help </e2> .   I'm struggling with it, I'm way to distracted/euphoric and if anything is happening in my life that cant be solved instantly, i'm get fixated on trying to fix this issue that I cant focus on anything else.   If I'm in a normal mindset I still feel the need to be around people and talk this can sometimes help with work if I'm doing work with people, but still not as much as i'd hope for, and if I'm by myself I'm more distracted by the fact I have no one around me which just causes me anxiety.   I've decided I'm going to the docs tomorrow to tell them I'm stopping temporariliy and if they can try anything else as I think in the long run its going to cause more halm then good.   EDIT: I'm also anti-depressants for my anxiety which dont help whilst on concerta  Any advice welcome :)
If they're worried about me, they should leave me the fuck alone and let me die in peace	Every time someone says this shit it just forces me to stumble through more painful, pointless fucking days of existence until the next time I collapse and can't pull myself along	Topic.   <e1> If they're worried about me, they should leave me the fuck alone and let me die in peace </e1> .   <e2> Every time someone says this shit it just forces me to stumble through more painful, pointless fucking days of existence until the next time I collapse and can't pull myself along </e2> .  And then? They're just worried about me again.  Just let me collapse.  The times when I'm faking smiles are the times when I'm truly miserable.  I just want this shit to be over with, but these fucking people won't let me.  they don't care about how i feel.  they just don't want to deal with the sadness of losing someone who doesn't even give a shit about them.  Hell, if anything, the times when I'm crumpled up in bed are times when I'm better managing my suicidal thoughts than anything else.  It's when I'm out in public looking like any normal fucking happy idiot that it's worse.  It's not like these thoughts ever go away.  I just want someone who understands that.  I want to know I'm not the only one who gets it.   I originally had this posted in depression but I decided it belongs better here. 
Dropped medications after 1. 5 years	severe mood swings, which went away with time	I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder around 5 years ago.   <e1> Dropped medications after 1. 5 years </e1> .  It resulted into  <e2> severe mood swings, which went away with time </e2> ; and suicidal tendencies which became persistent.   There is no long time fixed pattern (sometimes it is periodic with period in range of 1 week to 1 month).  However I generally become suicidal after attending events others enjoy (parties, social events, festivals etc).   Any effective way to handle this? So far I am trying to keep myself busy in programming (the only I stuff I love).   Any help will be appreciated. 
Hopefully	.	Hopefully someday some people will begin to care about abuse victims. . . . but today is not that day.  People try to say they care but words are not actions.  Words do not help when I feel internally tormented constantly. . . . . . . 
Hey,	is	Hey, so I've noticed if I take a small dose of Vyvanse (10mg) I feel like myself, but more clear headed, slightly more alert, less anxious, and happier but as soon as I get to a point that I'm actually fully alert(30mg~), I become anxious, less happy (humor isn't appealing, no laughing, etc. ) and my head isn't clear (hard to think abstractly).    What is happening in my brain that makes this the case? Over stimulation?   Does this mean that 10mg is my ideal dose? Even though I feel more alert/productive at a higher one?       What is

I originally began seeing him	Borderline Personality Disorder	So I've been seeing this great psychiatrist since September of last year.   <e1> I originally began seeing him </e1>  for  <e2> Borderline Personality Disorder </e2>  but as we built more trust I opened up about the PTSD symptoms I was experiencing.  I talked with him today in full detail about my past and it was the first time I saw him really react to what I was saying.  He's always attentive and providing feedback but he's never looked sad for me before.  I can't really explain it better than that.    Has anyone ever had this kind of experience? Has anyone ever seen their therapist/psychiatrist react strongly to a personal story or experience?

I don't commonly get anxiety anymore since I started my adhd meds but do have a history of it	maybe that plays into it	Hey, not sure if this is the correct sub for this, but anyways here goes!  I randomly get short extreme bouts of feeling guilty as if I had just hurt someone or have done something horrible;  <e1> I don't commonly get anxiety anymore since I started my adhd meds but do have a history of it </e1> , so  <e2> maybe that plays into it </e2> .  But anyways, I somewhat-comonly feel extreme guilt over ridiculous things like waking up 15 minutes late or sometimes absolutely nothing at all; things I enjoy can make me feel guilt at random, then 30 minutes later it's all fine and I feel normal.   Anyways, I was just curious if this is common with adhd; if so how you guys deal with it.  I do plan on getting with a therapist anyways when I can though just because it's something that bugs the crap out of me. 
I just felt I was stupid	not being able to get my work done	Don't get me wrong, I'm not actually happy about it but for the first time in years I feel like I'm not alone.    I was just diagnosed with ADHD a week ago.  Before that,  <e1> I just felt I was stupid </e1>  for  <e2> not being able to get my work done </e2> , to concentrate, etc.  I always felt like I was so different from everyone, and like I did not belong anywhere.  I had heard about it, but I never knew somebody who actually got the way I felt.  Reading all your posts has just made me feel like I'm not alone.  It's so relieving.  
I felt like I was going to have a panic attack and wanted to cry	I started listening to some sad music	I've struggled with depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder for 5+ years.  At the moment, I'm also in love with someone who will never love me back.  Even though I have a group of good friends, I still struggle a lot and the last months have been especially hard for me (unrequited love is horrible).   But yesterday, I studied together with my friends.  We didn't even talk much, just being with them made me feel genuinely happy.  As we all know, however, depression just wouldn't let me enjoy the whole evening.   After eating, a wave of sadness overcame me.   <e1> I felt like I was going to have a panic attack and wanted to cry </e1>  - so  <e2> I started listening to some sad music </e2> .  What I didn't count on though, was that it actually made me feel calmer, and soon the sadness dissipated.  When I went home, I was amazingly elated and more happy than I'd been in days.   And today, the sun is smiling down at me.  I think I'll study a bit, maybe go for a walk, and what's more important - I will never give in. 
Would prefer one with standup comedians	They're always be better at talking and much more enjoyable to listen to	 <e1> Would prefer one with standup comedians </e1> .   <e2> They're always be better at talking and much more enjoyable to listen to </e2> .  That said, I'm open to anything.  
I see it as significant and a big step forward	I go not smoking	Today a friend who is a smoker visited.  First he called and I was a bit apprehensive not knowing how I would deal with it.  I need not have worried, I was only minimally tempted and controlled myself much easier than I feared.   <e1> I see it as significant and a big step forward </e1> .  On  <e2> I go not smoking </e2> .  
I	advice?	I find it extremely hard to stay interested in video games long enough to complete any anymore, although I don't truley feel bored playing them.  Then I go and buy a new one and repeat the cycle.  Any advice?
So	patients	So a few days ago, I posted a thread on here asking what improvements could be made to your local mental health system.  Really happy with the responses, so thank you.   Our province is in the process of putting together an all-star team of a committee to help evaluate how adolescent mental heath crisis situations are treated.  It's basically a mix of former patients
Go through withdrawal thinking my pain is gone, only to go back on it	pain over and over	Nerve pain is acting up again and am really sick of using kratom.  Been through withdrawals over and over this past year and it's destroying my life.  Is there any other medication for nerve pain that doesn't have the side effects kratom gives or withdrawals? When I'm on kratom, I am lethargic, no sex drive, always depressed and anxious.  Always up and down.   <e1> Go through withdrawal thinking my pain is gone, only to go back on it </e1>  due to  <e2> pain over and over </e2> . .  any other options besides kratom? I've heard of pregabalin and gabapentin, but those withdrawals sound worse :/
after I've paid my bills I don't even have enough to buy food	I've been spending what little money I do have on whatever my dealer has in stock	For the last 6 months I've been living away from my parents, my life is travelling down a very scary path, how ever this road comes to a dead end soon.   In these last 6 months I've been doing nothing but drugs and drinking, I work 2 days a week and  <e1> after I've paid my bills I don't even have enough to buy food </e1> , so  <e2> I've been spending what little money I do have on whatever my dealer has in stock </e2> .  Over the last few weeks I have been drinking heavily, I can't remember anything from last night or the night before, or the night before that.  There is one thing I know, I have finally come to understand substance abuse, there is a gaping hole in me and while drinking or doing drugs doesn't fill it, they atleast cover it over for a while.  This makes me scared, I have become hat guy from the movies and TV
just feel even crappier about my self	I realized i'm wasting my life away doing nothing i'm happy with and nothing that will make me happy again	recently my girlfriend/best(and only) friend left me, and I have in turn been left with no-one to talk to in weeks besides my sociopath pot head co-worker and my idiotic greedy boss.  I go home sit on my bed and play games to try to get out of this mind set and feel like i'm somewhat important, but  <e1> just feel even crappier about my self </e1>  because  <e2> I realized i'm wasting my life away doing nothing i'm happy with and nothing that will make me happy again </e2> . . .  I need advice for what I can do to help if anyone on the subreddit can help please I need help i'm so lonely and its killing me. 
Hey	process.	Hey everyone! I'm wondering if you guys ever saw a change in your art-making process when taking medication.  Like were your sketches really scribbly before medication and now it's cleaner looking? Did certain things like inking or painting took an absurdly long time for you? I'm asking because I'm hoping to get diagnosed soon and I don't know how medication will affect my drawing process. 
I was afraid it was effecting my job	now I've been taking it regularly and seeing a therapist	I've been diagnosed at a fairly young age (I honestly don't remember, middle-school maybe?) But I stopped taking the medication after a year or two.  I'm out of college now and A year ago I got re-diagnosed because  <e1> I was afraid it was effecting my job </e1> ,  <e2> now I've been taking it regularly and seeing a therapist </e2> .   Lately I've been hobby hopping a lot.  I find something new
He is bipolar	that mixed with my depression was hard sometimes	I know on the outside looking in this seems like a no-brainer.  Why on earth would someone miss being with an abuser?   The thing is. . . I don't miss being with an abuser.  I miss being with the guy I had him painted to be in my mind, and the guy he was about 20% of the time.  I miss not being alone, and I miss being held and cared for when he was in the mood to be sweet.     <e1> He is bipolar </e1> , so  <e2> that mixed with my depression was hard sometimes </e2> , but I would try to stuff my feelings down to help him in his down stages.  The relationship was a whole lot of give and not a lot of return
I'm a night owl, but my husband and kids are already asleep	I feel so painfully bored and lonely right now	It's 10:30pm on a Saturday.   <e1> I'm a night owl, but my husband and kids are already asleep </e1> .   <e2> I feel so painfully bored and lonely right now </e2> .  Realized tonight that I'm perhaps not loving my life as a stay at home mom/housewife and I drank every night to mask the boredom.  I think I need to make friends but I don't know how the hell to socialize without alcohol.  
I've been on Vyvanse for a few months now	could see the beauty in things like art, music, poetry	 <e1> I've been on Vyvanse for a few months now </e1> .  I was on Adderall for 5 years prior to switching.  The first day I started Vyvanse it was like I was myself for the first time in years and  <e2> could see the beauty in things like art, music, poetry </e2> .  Before they were just images, words, and sounds but now it's like I can deeply appreciate things of this nature.  Even in my daily life Im able to appreciate the Beauty of just every day life.  I've always tried to be a positive person and have always been spiritual but now it's just so much easier.  Like I am able to fully be myself.   I was trace fly diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder as well (high functioning).    Anyone else get this experience? I mean it's more than just a good mood or a euphoric high I'd sometimes feel on adderall.  It's not the same.  It feels like I'm becoming myself for the first time in my adult life on a pretty consistent basis.   Anyone else have this experience?
I've tried to drop out once at 15	I tried killing myself for the first time when I got back to school	uh idk if i should post my story or anything idk what's relevant anymore. . .  i've been depressed and anxious since 14 and first tried to kms at 16, then at 18.  I've technically been completely out of high school for about four years and got my diploma in a GED-equivalent program, though  <e1> I've tried to drop out once at 15 </e1>  (to much drama which is why  <e2> I tried killing myself for the first time when I got back to school </e2> ).   Basically, I'm not allowed to talk about my depression or my suicidal tendencies without getting my mom angry and most of the time the both of us pretend it never happened and I'm a completely normal young adult starting college a bit late.  Needless to say, I've been to college for 2 weeks and it's very obvious I can't live to this level of  ormalcy which seems to be the basic requirement in this family to not be thoroughly belittled and constantly emotionally abused.  That coupled with my Yearly Month of Freaking the Fuck Out (when I'm not sure if I'm 4 and need my hand held throughout routinely life or 94 and tired and ready to fucking Go
I've decided that I've had enough	I know alcohol is quite a dangerous drug so I'd be better off without it	Hello fellow redditors,  I'm 22 years old, weigh about 84kg (184lbs) and I've been drinking for about 2 years now and recently, for a few months, I've been drinking every night.  I don't drink that much, about 5 beers a night, which is about 2,5 litres of 4% beer.   I'm quite an anxious person, a bit of an hypochondriac and have moderate OCD/anxiety.   <e1> I've decided that I've had enough </e1> , since  <e2> I know alcohol is quite a dangerous drug so I'd be better off without it </e2> .   How would I go about quitting? Do you think I can quit cold turkey? I've done that before but didn't last more than 2-3 evenings.  Right now I'm thinking of tapering off - After having had 5 beers yesterday, I'd have 2 beers today, then just 1 tomorrow and then bye alcohol altogether - at least for a while.   Thanks anyone who comments, I'll really appreciate it  edit: spelling
With that said, I have not got diagnosed yet, but this disorder sounds *exactly* like me	I will be speaking to my psychologist about it very soon	I'm 20.  Fear of abandonment/rejection, no sense of identity, shit social life, depression and occasional suicidal ideation, unstable moods, the whole gambit.  When I was reading hte symptoms I felt like it was spelling out my whole life.   <e1>  With that said, I have not got diagnosed yet, but this disorder sounds *exactly* like me </e1> , so  <e2> I will be speaking to my psychologist about it very soon </e2> .

we will often hear answers and advice from all directions	we feel confused	Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.  --Lao-tzu  When we are confused about something in our lives,  <e1> we will often hear answers and advice from all directions </e1> .

I am in the process of weaning off alcohol	I am not confident in cold turkey	 <e1> I am in the process of weaning off alcohol </e1> .  Honestly, mostly because  <e2> I am not confident in cold turkey </e2> .  I went a couple years with no alcohol back in 2008-2010 and remember it being a time when I felt I had the most energy.  I want that back! I currently don't binge drink during the week but I do drink daily.  I want that to stop first, then back off of the weekend drinking too.  Has anyone done this and if so, what has worked?

I am getting bad dry mouth on 40mg.  I was wondering if any of you guys experienced it, and what should I do the stop it?   Also, will increasing dose increase dry mouth?

Any	frustration?	Any suggestions to calm my frustration?
**What's	(Yes	**What's the best system you've ever come up with for actually getting stuff done every day and showing up to most appointments close to the time they start?**  &amp;nbsp;  My current method seems to work, but only if I have notes hanging on the wall to remind me to use it daily.   1. ) I downloaded Workflowy on all my devices.  (Has mobile and desktop and offline functionality. )  &amp;nbsp;  2. ) Dumped *everything* I need to or want to do someday onto it in the form of action statements (usually just the next action I need to take toward my goal. ) I mean everything, down to find that missing sock check the dryer first.   Ex:  * Put water bill on autopay * Have the site resend my login so I can set it up.   &amp;nbsp;  3. ) I organized it into categories my brain likes.  (Yes
I've	stop.	I've been out of school with my bachelor's degree since August and I still can't find a job that actually uses it/pays a livable wage (finance).  I just keep seeing on Facebook or from other people that they're in jobs they love doing, in relationships, getting married, having kids (could really care less about the last two, but still).  Meanwhile, I'm single, live at home, still working the same job I did as I was in college, I've lost count of how many jobs I've applied for, had interview after interview and nothing.    Starting to believe that by the time I find something that pays a livable wage and actually has benefits, my classmates will be 1%ers driving $ 80k Range Rovers and driving Porsches on the weekend to their million dollar homes.    This kind of thinking isn't making me happy and I need to stop. 
No one will love us	we're moody and scary	It just seems like people like us never really live.  Think about it: people with BPD have a high risk of suicide, everytime I hear about someone who committed suicide, they always had mental issues, including but not limited to, bipolar disorder.   It frightens me.   <e1> No one will love us </e1>  because  <e2> we're moody and scary </e2> , as witnessed from my breakup 4 weeks ago, family members don't know how to take us seriously, and then we end up ending it all.  Does anyone ever find their happy ending? Is it possible to just have a normal life without having to hide the fact that we're on meds?
If	me.	If this doesn't belong here, and someone can direct me on a better subreddit, please let me know.   I've been on Lexapro for about 4 years.   While I definitely feel better on it than off it, I still don't feel great.   I don't really get depressed anymore, but I don't really get excited about things anymore.   I just feel kind of. . . neutral (which isn't how I want to feel).   I'm also always tired, even when I get like 10+ hours of sleep.   I know most of you aren't doctors or therapists, but I was wondering if any of you had similar experiences to this and could share?  I've read about SNRI's and I'm wondering if these are something I could try?  Sorry if this post is kind of all over the place.   I really just want others to share their experiences on different medications, or if they could at least point me in the right direction to help find what is right for me. 
Hey,	help.	Hey, all.  I am 22 with clinical depression, GAD, and OCPD.  I have never had problems before with claustrophobia.  I was in a study room at my college (4 walls - windowed - and a door) that I thought was just a little warm.  Next thing I know, I am breaking out in a sweat and feel like I can't breathe.  My necklace felt like it was choking me.  I got up and left the room to find an open-air study space, but the feeling has yet to go away.  My entire back is tense, I am still sweating, and I still feel like my necklace is choking me.  I have never had this problem before, and I don't know how to calm down (which is freaking me out more).  Please help.

This	other	This week I've told my best friend who I've been FWB with for 1. 5 years that I'm finally committing to him, that I love him, that I'm in love with him, and that I plan to marry him one day.  We talked about eloping.  He told everyone about me and how happy he is about me.    I can't get rid of my ex though.  Whom I've also recently discussed marriage and eloping with.    I love them both.  They both love me.  When I'm with one, I think, I need to get rid of the other.  I love this one.  When I'm with the other

I recently started seeing a new therapist who said it sounded like Bipolar II	my doctor put me on Lamictal	For the last ~6 years I was diagnosed with MDD and a few different forms of anxiety.   <e1> I recently started seeing a new therapist who said it sounded like Bipolar II </e1> , and after reading up on it it's like all the pieces fell into place and made sense.  So  <e2> my doctor put me on Lamictal </e2> , just started at 25mg and working up to 200mg.   I take:  Lamictal  Pristiq (100 mg)  Wellbutrin extended release (150 mg)  Buspirone (15 mg)  Xanax (. 25 mg as needed)  I'm not the kind of person who thinks the pharmaceutical industry is out to drug us all, but I am a little wary of taking so many different meds.  I'd just like a little perspective and hear about everyone's med cocktails and how you feel about it.   Thank you, I appreciate it. 
I know i could never kill myself	i love my family and friends too much to leave them like that	For the past year ive lost myself beyond belief.  Its been a huge mental struggle.  Im 18 struggling to graduate school, Have tickets to pay off That are due soon and dont have enough to pay for (parents dont know), got kicked out my dads house ect ect the list goes on.  Im a really outgoing person and seem to be really happy most of the time infront of people but theres always like an invisible cloud hanging over me everywhere i go reminding how worthless and how much of a dissapointment i am.  My parents work so hard for me and my siblings and i feel like they deserve way better than i can offer.   <e1> I know i could never kill myself </e1>  because  <e2> i love my family and friends too much to leave them like that </e2> , and i know im loved by many but the thoughts are non stop.  I feel so over weighted by so many life problems and expectations that i feel that i can never over come.  Even if i get over these current problems, theres always more and even worst to come.  Its like a never ending cycle with only one exit. 
My disease always wanted me to blame others for my actions	It was much easier that way	When we decide to take that drink after pledging sobriety, we are the only person responsible.   It is not my parents fault; it is not my boss' fault; it is not my spouse's fault; it is not the fault of that asshole in the AA meeting who tried to shove his God down my throat; and is not the fault of some random poster on the Internet.      <e1> My disease always wanted me to blame others for my actions </e1> .   <e2> It was much easier that way </e2> .   Resentments are one of alcoholism's most powerful tools.   I need to remind myself constantly no matter who I currently am irritated with, my decision to pick up the first drink is entirely mine.     Good luck all.   
Sorry	J	Sorry if this might be a bit long of a story, but hopefully it will help someone else.   What began as a routine board game night filled with friends, booze, and green, turned into a night of embarrassment, loneliness, and self-reflection.    As my friends and I were setting up our favorite board game we passed around a freshly packed bowl, grabbed beers from the fridge and shot the proverbial shit.  A pretty routine night, not very different than the rest.  We were all stoned as hell.   We began talking about some new beer that had recently started being sold locally.  I lamented that I should have went down to the store a block away and grabbed some before the game began.  My roommate jokingly asked why don't I go down there right now? He knew the answer, we all did.  Who wants to venture outside in shit whether while high? Easier to just say fuck it and be lazy.   To continue his joke, I was ready to reply: Well J
I think I am getting closer to my breaking point	It's just everything with my health and the seizures the depression and the anxiety	I just need to vent or here from somebody.    <e1> I think I am getting closer to my breaking point </e1> .    <e2> It's just everything with my health and the seizures the depression and the anxiety </e2> .   I don't know which way is up and which is down anymore.   I'm not even hanging by a thread anymore, I'm hanging by a fingernail.   I know that's a weird analogy but I don't know if anybody knows what I mean.    I know I'm probably read rambling and doubt anybody is going to respond.  But I figured I'd try.    I feel like cutting bit don't want to relapse after almost 7 and a 1/2 years.   I've only had 2 lapse in that time.  And right now the cutting demon is sitting on my shoulder whispering to me sometimes yelling.  I just want to give in, I want to be in control of the pain instead of the pain controlling me.    Been thinking even while I was in my therapy session of how easy and how many ways I can make everything stop.    I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm really close to just giving up
One	colon.	One of the worst things about ADHD in my opinion? Not even losing shit all the time, but even when you didn't lose something? But then something is missing, *they automatically assume you're the one who lost it and want to make you responsible for misplacing the item even when you say it wasn't you,* and then when they find the item like in the pocket of their own coat or something, they just laugh it off and move on without apologizing.   Like I don't already struggle with my ADHD enough and the way it's demolished my feeling of confidence and self worth for years and years.  Like I don't already get angry and frustrated enough with myself when I lose something.  Like I'm not already inclined to doubt myself and blame myself.  When I know for a fact You had it last.  they'll just get angry with me and tell me to go look for the item while they want to stand around and do nothing.    Hey.  Hey that guy.  Fuck you.  Fuck you sideways with a horse-dildo wrapped in rusted barbwire.  Let's see you misplace that when I wedge it 3 feet up your colon.

I'm almost crying learning exactly the nature of this beast	Very glad I found this place	So I just joined this subreddit.  I have ADHD-PI, and just read a recommendation from another poster to listen to Dr Barkley's 30 things about ADHD.  I am only about 20 minutes in so far, but what an eye opener.  All I knew was that I couldn't concentrate on tasks, focus was impossible, etc.  But hearing about these other features, like emotional impulsiveness. . .  So many eye opening facts.   <e1> I'm almost crying learning exactly the nature of this beast </e1> .   <e2> Very glad I found this place </e2> .

everyone really become an alcoholic	drinking every night for several years	I haven't had anything to drink but I am starting to wonder why I quit.  I am starting to wonder why I didn't even try to drink moderately first.  Well, I tried a few times. . . . but maybe not often enough? I didn't drink for most of my life, does  <e1> everyone really become an alcoholic </e1>  simply from  <e2> drinking every night for several years </e2> ? I am asking myself all these questions, I am feeling mad at people, sad at people, frustrated, oh yes I am feeling sorry for myself.  I work hard, I mother hard, I do so much every day, and then in the evening, don't I deserve to be imperfect!? If I could just learn how not to drink to oblivion. . . . . . I am totally rambling, don't mind me, I just would rather write here and see how irrational I am than to keep twirling the urge around in my head.  I still haven't gotten to the point where sobriety feels like a gift to me.  It still feels like an unfair burden and on the inside I am stomping my feet like a toddler.  Thank you all on this forum for being there.  
It's	strong.	It's going to take the man in me to conquer THIS INSANITY.  The rage is overflowing.  It doesn't help I work with entitled, self absorbed, greedy motherfuckers.  I don't mind physical confrontations and if thats how today ends, then so be it.  I hope I have the strength to restrain myself.  But regardless of anything, I am not going to smoke weed today thats for damn sure.  I hope everyone here is having a better day than me.  Be strong.  
I work my ass off to stay focused when I'm on the job	This leads to me feeling extremely frustrated and pissy on a daily basis	I don't want to be some sort of diva that needs to tell everybody not to talk to me or even approach me if I have my headset on, but shit this is hard to deal with.   <e1> I work my ass off to stay focused when I'm on the job </e1> , and that doesn't include all the hard work I put in just DOING my job.   <e2> This leads to me feeling extremely frustrated and pissy on a daily basis </e2> .  Any advice?
I'm	you?	I'm pretty new here, and I'm curious - do you consider yourself in recovery from Nparent abuse? I consider myself in recovery - meaning I have been working for years and now feel mostly unentangled with my Nmom and my own raging codependence.  How about you? What resources have helped you?
I hate texting	I always get anxious when somebody doesn't reply	 <e1> I hate texting </e1> .   <e2> I always get anxious when somebody doesn't reply </e2> ; it gives me more time to worry about what I said, and how they probably think I'm stupid for it. And then when they do reply, I worry about what I should say and end up ignoring them.  Then the cycle repeats. Anybody else feel similar?
i	go.	i havent gone to school in 2 months now, i dont see the point anymore. .  i fight with my mother alot (i live alone with her) ive tried seeking help from my sister but nobody gets it. .  i feel so alone even though i have so many friends. . i dont even feel sad anymore, i just feel useless and ''numb''im running away from home tomorrow, and i'm probably not gonna last long. just wanted to share this to someone before i go. 
I've	scary.	I've been doing well in my recovery, but this past week I've been more depressed and hopeless.   Is it possible to get worse, and lose your coping skills along the way?  I feel like this is what's happening, and it's really scary. 
I'm	Lexapro	I'm really concerned about my bipolar diagnosis, and I want to start from scratch.  Do you think any sensible psychiatrist would be willing to start from scratch? I talking about getting rid of my Lamictal, Latuda, and Lexapro. . .  then starting up an antidepressant again w/o a mood stabilizer.  (So yes, in theory, that would be intentionally inducing mania. )I want to add that I allegedly became manic on Lexapro
Mornings	ok.	Mornings are hard for me I realized.  I sweated a lot last night I really thought I was going to be done with the sweats.  Bad dreams about ex boyfriend who is still stalking me and how I miss him. .  When in reality I don't.  I just feel blah in the morning.  It's like I just can't wait for the next day already.  But, it's not like the withdraws are really there except for sweating at night and weird dreams.  Maybe I'm not being positive enough.  I got some good ideas for going back to my old job contract.  Set an appointment for next week.  I'm thinking I'm going to reach out to someone once a day for this contract work.  That way I won't overwhelm myself.  I'm curious if I'm going to have a lot of anxiety for my first appointment next week.  But, I think I'm really going to be ok.  
It just never occurs to me that I have to actually take initiative for my loved ones to know I care, even though I think about them all the time	Texting or calling feels like a chore	 <e1> It just never occurs to me that I have to actually take initiative for my loved ones to know I care, even though I think about them all the time </e1> .   <e2> Texting or calling feels like a chore </e2> , despite the fact that I'm always glad I did after the fact.  I only seem to realize I've put off talking to someone I used to be close until it's already been weeks. How do you avoid. . . avoiding people? :/
it felt, you know, empty	There were no animated discussions and we never laughed till our stomachs hurt	Tonight I went out to a nice bar with my best friend and had a virgin Caesar.  We chatted a bit, had a couple of laughs, enjoyed the atmosphere - oh and you can't beat my $ 2. 50 bar tab for the night - but  <e1> it felt, you know, empty </e1> .  We just talked.   <e2> There were no animated discussions and we never laughed till our stomachs hurt </e2> .  I guess this is a fair trade but I miss the stuff I liked. I guess I just cut out something that was a huge part of my life and now I'm standing here like, so now what? Lol should I join a hot yoga gym and host weekly Settlers of Catan tournaments? What - it's like 99% of my motivation was based in getting another drink and now I have nothing to do. I'm also scared that I feel like I can really do this.  I actually have vodka in my freezer right now that I'm either going to pour down the toilet or give away.  When I realized it was still there
I just can't enjoy my life like this	When I'm on suboxone it affects me a tad bit different than regular opiates	When I got on subs I thought everything was going to be perfect in my life and I am ok but  <e1> I just can't enjoy my life like this </e1> .   <e2> When I'm on suboxone it affects me a tad bit different than regular opiates </e2> .  I feel fine but I just feel emotionally numb all day.  Not happy
I'm afraid of ending up with a bad guy	that happens anytime I go out on the market	This comes up a lot and today someone who identified themselves as a therapist wrote it and. . . man I really hate that.  I'm a survivor of multiple rapes in very different circumstances.  I'm still trying to recover but this sticking point is whether I can ever have a healthy relationship.  That feels pretty elusive!And then I say  <e1> I'm afraid of ending up with a bad guy </e1>  because  <e2> that happens anytime I go out on the market </e2> .  And then people say my picker is broken.  I fucking hate that! It feels like victim-blaming and also not super productive.  It shifts so much responsibly to the victim and I find it paralyzing.  If my picker is broken
Not sure if you can track how happy I am	I've managed to stop smoking completely	I'm a vaper since four years (see my badge) and I used to vape about 20 ml of ejuice each three days at a strength of 9 mg nicotine per ml.  This means I'm inhaling about 60 mg of nicotine each day. I've smoked the first cigarette at the age of five.  I've used cigarettes during kindergarden, school, university and later on too.  I've always made experiments about how to quit, monitoring myself, setting goals, reaching goals.  Reaching goals is cool! <e1> Not sure if you can track how happy I am </e1> , since  <e2> I've managed to stop smoking completely </e2> ! This was such a long journey (and a struggle)!While I've had many many attempts to stop smoking, since I've stopped I've never made any attempts to stop nicotine vaping. Therefor I will use this thread to document how it's going during the next seven days.  Or is it six days? However, next sunday 15:00 TAI this trial will end!  timeanddate. com/time/international-atomic-time. html. Just for the records: I will vape without nicotine during this week.  If you have any questions or just want to encourage me, feel free to reply!
For	pay	For a long time I've had suicidal thoughts but never had the effort/dedication to follow through with any of it.  I just wish someone would come up to me with a little red button that says push to quit.  It's almost become symbolic to me when I think about that red button now after revisiting the thought so many times. The most frustrating thing about all of it however is I don't even have that bad of a life.  I've got a job with nice pay
I	essay.	I never made many friends throughout highschool but did very well up to this year (senior year).  I have 2 weeks of school left and i just missed a whole week.  I have no reason to be so miserable but I've lost all my motivation to do anything.  I have the lowest course load possible and I can't get any of my school work done.  I'm probably not going to finish highschool and that will prevent college too.  I'm horrible to my parents and don't do of my work for no reason.  I'm 18 and can't even handle writing a shitty second semester senior essay. 
I get really depressed	I can barely walk	My neurologist put me on a total of 150mg of Zoloft after I was diagnosed with MS.  But I had been struggling with depression since I was 12.   <e1> I get really depressed </e1>  on days  <e2> I can barely walk </e2> .  How will drugs help that?
At	Nmum	At what point did you actually realise that what your parent/s were doing was not normal? My abuse has went on since I was born, and it wasn't until I turned 23 that I realised that it was in fact ABUSE and not parents being parents after my partner sat me down and explained to me that I was in fact in an abusive relationship with my Nmum
all	reading	all the small failures, they break me apart, they fucking destroy my heart and I can see a future for me. I cant do a college assignment, spend the night awake thinking about how I'll be completely miserable and jobless for therest of my life.  The feeling is so strong it phisically hurts.  It happens everytime, at every small failure. Wish I could just drop the fuck out of college but I haven't anything else to do fuck my life, this life is killing me I'm slowly dying. sorry for all that and thanks for reading
I've had minor depression since grade school	from bullying	 <e1> I've had minor depression since grade school </e1> ,  <e2> from bullying </e2> .  In the last months, I've started taking Zoloft to help with anxiety that I didn't know I had, and been in therapy the last year. I know that I'll need a better job to help support my insurance soon, and that I'm so lucky my family has helped me through the last 4 years of my treatment.  I don't get very often to say how much I appreciate lately feeling good about myself.  It's such a relief not to hate myself whenever I have an embarrassing thought cross my mind, and to be ok with the difficulties of life (sometimes not even wanting to get out of bed to face them, but I try anyways). I want you all to know I love and appreciate the support /r/depression has given me, and that I want to love and support you.  Leave a comment for a loving message! (Well, by tomorrow.  I'll see them when I wake up!)
In	experience?	In the months leading up to 9/11 I was clinically depressed.  I have struggled with depression my entire life, but at this particular moment, things were really rough.  I mean really rough.  I had a wonderful, beautiful girlfriend; I had great friends and a supportive family; I was in a band and recorded an album; I was a senior in high school and had the future in front of me.  Yet, I felt no joy or even the remotest sense of life -a complete lack of vitality.  That is, until 9/11.  I have never told anyone this, but for the week or so following 9/11 I actually felt alive, which shouldn't have been the case considering my brother had just joined the US Marines and the country was at war.  After things around the country settled down and the threat was over I settled back in to depression.  Why? I have a thousand theories on the subject, but I would really like to know if anyone else has had a similar experience? 
How	bipolar.	How bad is your anger?I've been diagnosed as bipolar + ADHD, but sometimes I question the bipolar diagnosis. I have severe anger where I physically destroy things.  For example, I purposely kicked a hole through my closet door.  I've also purposely smashed several of my cell phones.  I've physically hit people, etc. .  I'm pretty reckless in that sense. I don't know if that type of anger is more typical of bipolar, I guess. I'm just trying to learn about ADHD anger, as I've been diagnosed with both ADHD and bipolar. 
So	dinner	So I've been on adderall for about 5 years now (24 M 180lbs), with some breaks in between and various dosages.  I'm currently on 10mg IR which I take 1-2. 5 pills a day.  I don't exactly take a set amount each day, some days I take a just a 1 pill, while others I'll take 2. 5 it sort of depends on how I'm feeling when I wake up and what type of work I need to do.  To which I would assume this modular intake has some affect on how the adderall is metabolized by my body.  I make it a point to not take any after 5pm, as it seems it takes roughly 30 mins to kick in then I'm graced with a 2-3hr period of euphoric focus.  After that I'm still awake and wired, although I don't have the same motivation to do academic task as when I'm in the zone.  However the issue I'm running into is being able to fall asleep; say I take 10mg at 10am and another 10mg at 2:30pm.  My euphoric focus will wear off around 6-8pm.  To which point I'll typically eat dinner
It	years	It annoys me that I smoke.  Last cigarette was yesterday night right before going to sleep.  I just woke up.  Normally I would make a coffee, and then immediately fall back in to the rhythm of lighting these bastards every hour or so. I can't really find a nice method to make me stop smoking which I believe in. last time I tried to stop I had a friend slap me literally in the face every time I smoke.  It worked for a while, then I just started not telling him when I did smoke.  It was worth a try. .  Haha, but feels a bit stupid to write that down now.  Anyway!Now I just do it. Edit: smoker for 16 years
I have always been totally overwhelmed with spreadsheets	Last year I spent 30 hours making a spreadsheet for my accountant	 <e1> I have always been totally overwhelmed with spreadsheets </e1> .   <e2> Last year I spent 30 hours making a spreadsheet for my accountant </e2> .  It was so thorough and detailed.  It was totally overwhelming to make it and I knew it was taking me 10 times longer than it would take anyone else but I refused to let this one get away from me.  I sent it to her and she was like what the hell. .  how about we use this.  it's a lot more simple. Doing my taxes usually takes months and months and lots of tears and ovewhelm.  Just finding receipts makes me feel so stressed.  Every year I try to implement a new system so the next year won't be so bad
That	while.	That he's blowing me off, he hates me and it was all a setup to fuck with me emotionally and get back at me.  God I hate BPD, why can't my mind ever just shut down for a while. 
I'm worried	I might have to face it spreading on Monday	See title, I did something stupid/embarrassing and immediately afterwards some guy told me I'd regret it which I really do.  It's been eating away at me for a long time today and  <e1> I'm worried </e1>   <e2> I might have to face it spreading on Monday </e2> .  What do you guys do to keep stuff like this out of your head?  Sorry if this post breaks any rules or formatting stuff I havent posted here before and this post is getting a bit too long anyways. 
couldn't remember if I already took my pill	Decided to not take (another) one	Title. Been taking 150mg since three months. This morning I took my pill bottle, got distracted by whatsapp and  <e1> couldn't remember if I already took my pill </e1> . . .   <e2> Decided to not take (another) one </e2> . It's 4:30pm now and I'm feeling weird and am in an consistent irritated mood since hours.  Annoyed with everything, head feels a little bit weird too. Should I wait untill tomorrow or just take a pill now?**edit1** basically feel  like I want to punsh someone in the face. **edit2** 0442 just took one.  This the worst mood I've been in for the last month
I	me.	I can't sit through a movie without turning on my iPad, I have isolated myself from others.  I have tried to self medicate my condition with cannabis.  I have reached a point in my life where it is no longer enjoyable.  I am 26 years old and need to make drastic changes to turn it around before it's too late.  All these statements seem very dramatic and I kind of feel bad for posting this coming across so negatively.  But I literally have no one else to turn to, has anyone got any advice or experience to cope with this and help me. 
I lose a game because me or a team-mate did something stupid and threw our win away	I have feeling an immense strain build up inside my stomach and up into my chest after the game	I've been playing a video game for about a year now, and it is a highly competitive strategy game revolving around getting towers, etc.  and it has a rank-based system where you go up or down depending on all different things. Lately whenever  <e1> I lose a game because me or a team-mate did something stupid and threw our win away </e1>   <e2> I have feeling an immense strain build up inside my stomach and up into my chest after the game </e2> , initially I tried just slow breathing in and out but it didn't help, and has led now to biting down as hard as I can onto the fleshy part of my thumb just to help me feel better. I've tried stress balls, calming music, playing less competitive game, but I just can't help the feeling that I think I've gained through personal life matters that I won't get into in this post.  Can anyone help me as I don't want the only way I can recover from it to be self-harming. P. S I don't do any other forms of self-harming and never will. 
that did not last	Actually a couple different things simultaneously, not all bad, but just a lot I could not handle	Awhile back, I would say last Julyish I quit smoking after smoking for 4 years before.  I, to my surprise, felt like it wasn't entirely too difficult.  I even went cold turkey.  I made it past the 3 day mark, the 3 week, and the 3 month.  I thought I was officially a non-smoker. Unfortunately,  <e1> that did not last </e1> .  I think it was around the 250 day mark, but some things happened in my personal life.   <e2> Actually a couple different things simultaneously, not all bad, but just a lot I could not handle </e2> .  I drank a lot for a couple of weeks and as a result eventually everything caught up with me.  I wasn't thinking straight and I did the unthinkable.  I bought a pack and started smoking again. I don't know why I did it.  I can't believe I did it.  So here I am again.  I just got around to resetting my flair. .  so sad to see it got up to 305 days while I was gone :(. I just moved to a new city, so I am excited to start life here as a non-smoker.  
History.	everyone!	History.  31 m uk.  Depression for years.  No idea of cause.  Strong antidepressants.  No counselling.  Woefully inadequate mental health services in Norfolk.  Today.  Relationship is going down the drain.  Ex is blocking my access to my daughter.  Debts mounting.  Head will explode.  This is the closest I've ever come to ending my life.  I need help.  I need hope.  Please.  UPDATE: 08 Jun 16 ~ 3 1/2 weeks after above.  Firstly thank you to everybody who posted their help.  Unfortunately the posts, Samaritans and my partner could bring me down from my 'agitated' state and the police were called along with the ambulance service.  I was sectioned under a 136 for the night and the crisis team say with me to discuss everything.  The biggest thing that helped me was the fact that I'm finally getting help.  I've still not seen a counsellor as I've been bumped down the scale as I'm not currently a threat to myself.  But I can see a glimmer of light on the horizon.  They're willing to listen, talk and help!Thank you again to everyone! 
I've	medication.	I've never had the opportunity to try meds yet, but I was kind of half diagnosed by a university paid psychologist, but I've always loved music and I'm curious about  the difference between listening to music with and without medication. 
I'm	snarky	I'm finally seeking help for ADHD, but my mom still doesn't understand it.  And she can't go more than a few sentences without being mean.  And I'm feeling angry lately.  We calmly sat down today.  I tried to explain ADHD with a chart of how happy normal people get from activities vs ADHD people, and I fucked it up a bit.  But it was still calm.  Next my mom decides to convey her understanding of what I said by talking shit about my sister.  You know how your sister used to enjoy clubbing and nobody likes her because of it? There was so much wrong in this sentence that I yelled.  And she yelled and gave a snarky
I find myself very lonely nowadays	My best friend moved out of my town, and there's no one really here anymore	When I drank Friday , I was out with a drinking buddy of mine.  I hadn't really done any real socializing outside of work or band practice in about 3. 5 weeks.  I was lonely.  We had a good time.  I was out.  I was talking to people.  I didn't feel shy.  But I drank.  <e1> I find myself very lonely nowadays </e1> .   <e2> My best friend moved out of my town, and there's no one really here anymore </e2> .  I don't have a girlfriend, even though I would love a girlfriend I have no idea how to go about getting a girlfriend.  But then I see what the problem is : you don't get people.  It's not like you can go out and just pick out a girlfriend or friend.  I have trouble recognizing if I just want someone to be around or if I actually want to share my time and experiences with somebody.  I think most of the time it's the latter.  I just feel so crushed sometimes 
I	.	I live in a small town, Estill Springs, and thinking of moving down to Chattanooga.   Possibly going down to the Oasis Transitional Living. Also just looking for people to hit meetings with or adventure with. . .  Rock climb, waterfalls, photography. . . .   I do come up to Nashville some too but problem is I don't drive.   Would be more than happy to pitch on gas. . . . 
For some reason I have this belief that SSRI medication will block my spirituality	I was very hesitant to start it	Just started an SSRI a few days ago.  Haven't had any motivation to pray or meditate.   <e1> For some reason I have this belief that SSRI medication will block my spirituality </e1> .  Does anyone take SSRI and meditate? Have you tried meditation with and/or without SSRI and notice any difference? Better or worse?  <e2> I was very hesitant to start it </e2>  but I know I need to give the SSRI a little bit more time.  I think maybe I was so depressed and desperate that meditation was comforting.  Now on a few days of SSRI, it seems useless to meditate.  
do believe I have BPD	I regularly fit many of the requirements for BPD in any given day	I realize that this is not the place to speculate.  However, I have done a lot of research and  <e1> do believe I have BPD </e1> .  I have been diagnosed with a gamut of things in the past such as adjustment disorder and an eating disorder but I haven't been to see someone in 4 years.   <e2> I regularly fit many of the requirements for BPD in any given day </e2> .  I'm horrified that this counselor won't take me seriously.  I haven't slept well in two weeks since I got the appointment.  I don't know how to bring up my concerns
When it does come back I try to go to my boyfriend for support but he either calls me a martyr or doesn't say anything	This has made me feel even more isolated and I feel like I'm just bottling everything up and taking it out on myself later	I have been doing really well handling my depression lately.   <e1> When it does come back I try to go to my boyfriend for support but he either calls me a martyr or doesn't say anything </e1> .  Now I feel like I have no one to go to who understands or can at least try to comfort me.   <e2> This has made me feel even more isolated and I feel like I'm just bottling everything up and taking it out on myself later </e2> .  How to I tell him how in feeling without him rejecting it like I'm some freak? Or even just some comfort to know he hears me and is there? I've tried to describe how I feel but he doesn't understand and doesn't take it seriously. 
I	thoughts.	I wish that I would die, from getting in an accident or from an incurable disease or something.  But I don't think that I would kill myself.  Is this somewhat normal or do you think that these are suicidal thoughts.  
I've	delusional?	I've stopped gaming for a phew months now and it's Been great workouts have been better got a better diet been improving my social skills increasing my dancing skills been going out to city more.  But what I'm finding is that at night time I'm pretty bored like yeah I read books but after reading for about a hour let's say it's 8pm I still got time I kind of feel like building  pc to play games since I sold my gaming pc. Am I being delusional? 
well,	Man	well, 16 days but i forgot to post!For anyone reading this who wants to quit but hasn't yet, I cannot recommend 'Allen Carr's Easyway' enough.  I truly haven't had a single craving and i've been out drinking a few times since i stopped which i was worried i'd struggle with.  The closest thing i've had to a craving is a realisation of Man

I	related	I can't explain it, maybe anyone here can.  I get irritated easily.  It's not due to anxiety or depression or anything.  I always tend to say when you're angry or bitter for this long there's always a a cause, but I can't find it or find a solution that applies to why I'm suddenly irked.  Simple things like these below almost always irritate me:* When my earphones are suddenly yanked out* Getting pricked by pointy objects (thumbtacks, pencils, nails, sowing needles, etc. )* Being itchy a lot* Being hot and constricted* Having to repeat myself a lot* People who are slow/hesitant to do or say things* People who are unsure a lot (saying I don't know or I don't care when asked a simple yes or no question)* When I or others mess up too much on a task/activity* When things don't go my way often* Dropping things frequently* Bumping into things a lot* Being shoved* Someone slamming the breaks when I'm in a car. It then spirals out of control.  I thought it was stress related
Hey	.	Hey I'm a 21 year old male that used to drink a good amount (like 3-5 days a week), and have a great time drinking.  I used to always get that happy/excited/pumped up feeling while drinking.  Well I recently stopped drinking and went cold turkey for two months, now I drink 0-2 times a week and it just isn't that fun anymore.  I know that may have to do with outside factors as well such as: who I'm drinking with, where I go, etc.  but I don't get that same happy feeling anymore I just get really tired and relaxed.  It's not like I get angry or sad or anything but I just don't get as excited or really care like I did.  I kinda miss that pumped up drunk I used to get.  Just wondering if this has happened to anyone else. . . 
It's	whatever	It's sex, it makes me really uncomfortable.  Like, i get all cold and stiff inside my body, it's so weird.  Every time the girl i'm seeing brings up sex, i freeze, get this sadness washed over me and a anxiety attack.  I mean, i might just be stupid or something, i might just not get it or whatever
I've	help.	I've never thought about posting this before.  But something is happening to me and I don't know what.  I'm in high school and I used to be a fun kid to hang around.  Now I get nervous when I'm about to go hang out with people.  It starts with nervousness, but then I get a horrible stomach ache.  Then that gets the best of me and I end up hanging out with no one.  I usually play video games to keep my mind off of everything.  But I just started getting panic attacks and it has been freaking me out.  I think about things like if my parents died, I wouldn't know what to do.  It seems like fear itself is taking over me and I don't know why.  Tonight I have a party to go to but I'm here at home with another stomach ache.  Maybe I'm just looking for help.  
I	oh	I just started seeing someone.  Very recently.  He's normally been very communicative but didn't text me at all today.  I spiraled and curled up in a little ball and fought the urge to break it off or say something mean / passive aggressive - oh
Being	die	Being depressed has killed me inside the only time I feel anything is at night when everything worries me and I think about every bad decision I've ever made I feel like I'm just sitting here waiting to die
Im	it.	Im certain that 100% of it is bs, now i just need facts to prove it. 
I said screw it, i'll try it	I had ran out	Hey guys.  So I've been on and off dexedrine in pretty low doses most of my life, taking an 8 year break in between.  With experience, I know the feeling of upliftment, motivation, energy, focus pretty well. I recently went to fill my prescription and was told that they only had a new manufacturer's dex in stock - KVK.   <e1> I said screw it, i'll try it </e1> , as  <e2> I had ran out </e2> .  Let me tell you - something is definitely off with this formulation.  If you're genetically prone to it and know the feeling, there's a distinct feeling of oxidative stress in the brain (some people just feel it as fogginess), a lingering lethargy after the dose wears off, like your body is more beat up by it than a usual dex dose, and theres a kind of 'psychosis' for lack of a better word - just feeling off - not yourself.  It's pretty rough. Does anyone have any info or experience with this brand? Or possible ideas as to what's going on? Fillers
So	it.	So I've had anxiety since I was probably 6 or 7.  I also have OCD and depression.  But this is about my anxiety.  My anxiety consist of. -Fear of not being able to breathe-Fear of having a allergic reaction to anything-Fear of being hated by certain people-Fear of breaking down while driving on the highway Anyone else have these anxiety problems?How do you cope or get rid of them.  For me it's a different thing it seems every 6 months or a year.  And I can't get rid of it. 
In	hope.	In the summer of 2013 (I was an upcoming high school senior) I had my first blunt.    It was in a treehouse in Kampala, Uganda.  I'm not sure how high I actually got or if I even did get high.   But I do remember very good vibes and a great conversation with my new Ugandan friends.   If you asked me on that night what I would be doing in my life right now I would have told you I'd be a lot closer to becoming a neurologist, working a summer job, and training daily to get ready for my third cross country season at SDSU. If you ask me today what I'm doing in my life right now, you'd get a different answer.   I'm currently smoking everyday.   I'm 40 pounds heavier than when I ran cross country.   I'm out of college for now and am getting less and less optimistic everyday about there being stepping stones for me in life.   Sometimes after a day of heavy smoking I realize that the rest of my life might be like this.   I'm losing all hope. 
Do	yourself	Do you ever have a conversation with someone, but rather than saying outright what you want to say you hide it behind some disconnected experience? Like, rather than say what you'd want to say, you explain the actions of a movie character, hoping the other person makes the substitutions and knows you're really explaining something about yourself
Smoking was negatively affecting almost all aspects of my life	I decided to quit about 3 months ago	I'd been smoking for around 3 years but it had only been the past year where I realised that I was addicted.   <e1> Smoking was negatively affecting almost all aspects of my life </e1>  so  <e2> I decided to quit about 3 months ago </e2> .  I went from a depressed, lazy, unsociable, introverted stoner to a depressed, lazy, unsociable, introverted person.  I got disheartened and relapsed after ~5 weeks.  A few weeks of fucking around followed and I quickly realised that all of my problems were still there.  I quit again and I haven't smoked in 30 days.  Guess what.  Still the fucking same. I've given up.  I'm trying to get help with my depression but until that is sorted I feel like I'm doomed to be this unmotivated stoner that I'm fed up with. Thanks for reading, needed to get a few things off my chest. 
I'm 22 and in law school and just got diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD	now I'm sort of flailing on what to do	So,  <e1> I'm 22 and in law school and just got diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD </e1> , so  <e2> now I'm sort of flailing on what to do </e2> .  The psychologist that did the testing recommends I gets a prescription for one of the usual ADHD and told me to talk to my primary care physician about it.  The problem is, I haven't been to a doctor since my pediatrician way back when, so I don't have a primary care doctor.  I usually live out in the midwest but I'm one the east coast for the next three months and would rather get this all taken care of sooner than later.  I don't really know what I'm supposed to do.  Is it possible to go to a GP for just one appointment with the express purpose of getting a prescription or will they want me to be a more regular client before they're willing to do that? Do I call a doctor office and explain what I'm looking for or will they just think I'm trolling for meds? I guess I'm just a little lost and confused at this point.  Any advice? 
I	hard?	I used it to get off another opiate it did the job but now after 7 months of 30+ gram a day it's time to quit.  I'm just over it.  It's hard for me cuz I work from home and get bored. The worst side effect I get is anxiety and extreme sweating like bad. The second worst is Jimmy legs and insomnia I had 100 xanax on deck but I flushed them.  For now I have phenibut but it don't do much and some nyquil. What's the worst side effects u guys get? I don't plan to taper just to take as needed minimal amounts when I feel shitty. Is ot hard? 
It	this.	It is well known that ADHD sufferers tend to like videogames.   I've always felt that ADHD drew me towards more intense action shooters, but it's been a long time since a game really satisfied me.   Overwatch is like a whole new level.   Some of the characters like D. Va are incredibly intense, in the moment vehicles of norepinephrine and dopamine release.   I really can't remember the last time I got more hyperfocused than this. 
I started cutting myself a few months ago	anger	I've been depressed on and off for about 10 years now.  For the past 2-3 years I've had a couple weeks where I'm depressed and suicidal followed by a couple weeks when I'm extremely angry, during those weeks I'll have thoughts of hurting or murdering people.  I haven't done anything yet thankfully but these periods alternate and never stop.   <e1> I started cutting myself a few months ago </e1> , not because of depression but because of  <e2> anger </e2> .  I have to take out my anger on something but I don't want to hurt anyone so I hurt myself, it helps but I'm trying to stop.  Does this happen to anyone else?
It's	DEXAMPHETAMINE	It's a small achievement in the grand scheme of things but I'm so proud of my table! I'll be making inquiries at local hardware and timber stores to see if we can get the pieces we need to build it soon![Picture link]( imgur. com/GjtE2ke. png)On the left is an exploded view of different components and on the right is what the finished product should look like. THANK YOU DEXAMPHETAMINE
it makes me a zombie for 10-14 hours	I feel antisocial on it	While Ritalin LA (Methylphenidate XR) treats my ADHD symptoms well (great focus), <e1>  it makes me a zombie for 10-14 hours </e1> .   <e2> I feel antisocial on it </e2> . Regular Ritalin (Methylphenidate IR) makes me able to focus, but also makes me more social, optimistic and just generally gives me a feeling of well-being.  Its effects are prosocial and the subjective boost I get from it is nicer
Evening	this	Evening guys, I'm really in awe of a lot of you here.  I'm 26 and I've tried quitting what feels like a million and one times.  In the past 9 years that I've smoked, I have tried just about every method at least once.  Mostly, I've been trying to go cold turkey.  The longest amount of time that I've quit during that period was for 3 weeks on the dot.  This was last year, after I finished reading The Only Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr.  Prior to this
YOU CAN FREAKING DO IT TOO	I am living proof- that with a lot of study help skills &amp; tutors &amp; timers &amp; therapy (sometimes should have had more) somehow I (and you can too!) made it through	I'm still kind of in shock. I **graduated** yesterday.  I graduated cum laude *(with honors)* and I finished my **32** page thesis the day before I graduated.  (Always cutting it close hahah)Anyway- just a shout out.  Besides me being so happy for myself. . .  but for all the youngsters or teenagers or people who had to put a **pause** on college for a bit. . . . . ** <e1> YOU CAN FREAKING DO IT TOO </e1> ** <e2> I am living proof- that with a lot of study help skills &amp; tutors &amp; timers &amp; therapy (sometimes should have had more) somehow I (and you can too!) made it through </e2> . There were so many times through high school that it was just so *damn* hard- hell it was hard back in middle school and elementary.  I will say it does kind of suck that I found out so many of my tricks and tips- and now I graduated. SO if anyone ever needs study help or tips or any random stuff- feel free to message me!As I finished my undergraduate career and now have begun my unemployed career!!!!! (Kidding! but not really. . . . . )  
I've had my license since 19 but haven't driven in over a year	I panic so much	I have GAD and end up over analyzing things quite often.  One of the things I get really anxious over is driving a car.  I'm almost 21 and feel like I need to start driving.   <e1> I've had my license since 19 but haven't driven in over a year </e1>  because  <e2> I panic so much </e2> .   I am just now trying to drive again and have gone around city streets (a few times) and the highway (once since trying to drive again) Luckily my dad will drive in the passenger seat, but I think he is trying to ease off doing that.  My goal is to get a car of my own and be able to drive myself wherever.  Right now the way my mind is racing it seems impossible.  I know lots of people are nervous when they first start driving but I feel like I'm much more so - this level can't be normal.  Does anyone have any tips to easing this nervousness and to enjoy driving more? Most people seem to like it.  
The doctors and nurses in ICU were shocked	I was alive	Sooo, Memorial Day weekend.  5th anniversary of the day I attempted suicide.  Took 50 pills of 100mg Seroquel. . . 5 days in the ICU, 3 cups of liquid charcoal (the WORST) and immediate mental institution admission.   <e1> The doctors and nurses in ICU were shocked </e1>   <e2> I was alive </e2> .  Not super religious anymore but from that experience I do firmly believe I am here for a reason.  Memorial day, (raised in a military family) a day to remember the strength of the living and the fallen veterans; I was weak.  5 years later, not thinking of it as necessarily a sad day, but a day I take a moment to remember a low point in my life, yet to take pride in my survival.  For those struggling with suicidal thoughts and/or suicidal attempts: I am so glad you're here.  We're survivors.  
I've	difficult	I've always had trouble actually getting to bed/trying to fall asleep, but lately it's become a major issue that has had serious impacts on my grades in college.  I tell myself I want to get to bed at a certain time, but stay up past then.  Once I actually do get in bed I end up going on my phone.  I will tell myself 20 minutes which turns into an hour or more.  This lead to a loss of sleep.  Waking up became extremely difficult
Rehab isn't really an option for him	he would never even consider taking the time off of work to go	Hey guys.  I hope this is the right place for this, I honestly don't know where else to turn. My boyfriend has a really serious cocaine and alcohol addiction.   <e1> Rehab isn't really an option for him </e1>  because  <e2> he would never even consider taking the time off of work to go </e2> , even though his work is part of the problem (crazy night hours at a bar, so cocaine to stay awake, and the alcohol is abundant. . . ).  I'm so worried about him.  I don't want to sit around and watch his addiction eventually kill him but I also don't really have the power to do anything but watch? Does anyone have any advice, has anyone dealt with this kind of thing before? How do we help the people we care about who have addictions?tl;dr: boyfriend is addicted to cocaine and alcohol and I can't sit around anymore and watch him kill himself
I	exist.	I just want to be happy but she doesn't exist. 
other Mothers look down on her	only Families with a weak social background have kids with ADHD	My little Sister recently has been diagnosed with ADHD and discalculus.  After consulting with our Family and plenty of Therapists we decided to take a step and try giving her some Medicine(Medikinet(German term)).  My Mom told others that my sister has ADHD but  <e1> other Mothers look down on her </e1>  because  <e2> only Families with a weak social background have kids with ADHD </e2> (We are a family from upper middle class with the Father making enough money to have the best selfless Mother be able to stay at home).  They say things like good that you dont give her pills only bad mothers do this.  My Mother is frightened of saying that she is even though she knows better and me
my opinion of him(edad) has declined	Nmoms behavior has gotten more desperate	I feel like Nmom sent him to do her dirty work.  I enjoy my Edad's company and would love to see my GCbro, however  <e1> my opinion of him(edad) has declined </e1>  as  <e2> Nmoms behavior has gotten more desperate </e2> .  I'm feeling really guilty about possibly saying no, and what they might say in return.  The truth is 99% of the reason i want to say no is b/c of Nmom and how skeevy she makes me feel.  The other 1% consists of having a wild 18 month old that i dont want to take on a plane and my husbands schedule being tight over the next few months.  That and the fact that they (who both work from anywhere with an internet connection AKA home) have not flown out since my son was a month old.  Can someone please translate or remind me why i should say no? The guilt is thick in my head right now. . . . 
Over	turkey.	Over the past four years I've gotten increasingly into substance use.  Most notably, alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine and marijuana.  None of these things are good for me.  After recently making the decision to stop my medication again (with plans to resume soon), I've decided it would be hypocritical and counterproductive to not halt all other substances that impact the way my brain functions.  It sounds very difficult, especially given the culture of weed and beer that I live in, but I'd really like to give it a try. . .  no cigarettes, no weed, very minimal alcohol, very minimal caffeine.  Wish me luck! Habits are hard to kick.  I already have headaches and I just started yesterday.  It's a lot of things to quit cold turkey. 
I	.	I just talked to the counselor.  She said something is defiantly not right and she has to call my parents about it which is what i was afraid of. . .  Somebody may come into my school tomorrow and talk to me a little more deeply about this and shes gonna suggest things to do to help and they might have a Diogenes. . . . .  thats what im scared of. . .  what if i really am clinically crazy? what will my family think? what will my boyfriend think? what will the voices do in return for me not listening to them and keeping them a secret. . . ? How tf are they gonna help me without sticking me on meds which is the last thing i wanna do. . .  I dont know what to do and im scared. . .  I just wanna get better without loosing who i am and what ive worked towards. . .  someone please help me. . . 
After	lovelies!	After reading up a bunch on it, I've decided to give Vitamin B a try to calm down my mood swings and ease my anxiety, and hopefully my depression as well.  Already on 40mg of Prozac and taking Omega 3's each day, and hoping to go down eventually to 20mg as I've noticed some increased. . . irritability.  My stress isn't what it used to be, panic attacks and all, none of that now but I still need a little boost to help me get through everyday life.  From what I've seen, the best option would be B-12.  If that's so, what should the dosage be to easily obtain the full benefits of it? I think it's fair to mention that I'm a vegetarian as well, I barely ingest any dairy too, I've read about how much that can play a role in B deficiency. Would someone please care to share with me any additional info/personal experience with their quest to achieve a zen state with Vitamin B and/or any other natural supplement? :)Thank you lovelies!
I was so hopeful about this surgery	I stopped taking my depression medication	To the point - I've spent the last few months being tested to make sure that my enlarged pituitary gland was secreting hormones that would explain my deep depression, anxiety, weight gain, ect.  I was prepared for surgery for next week when all of a sudden my doctor says that the tumor is actually causing nothing and is more like a cyst.  So all my laziness, my perpetual tiredness no one can explain is all my fault.   <e1> I was so hopeful about this surgery </e1>  that  <e2> I stopped taking my depression medication </e2> .  Turns out, that was a mistake.  I skipped work today and the thought of going makes me cry even harder.  I don't want to wake up.  I'm playing with sharp objects against my wrist.  I don't know what to do. 
Just	manipulation?	Just got one from one of my Nparents and that's all it said.  Nparent was crying in it.  Not sure how to feel about it.  I don't feel sad though.  Anyone else deal with this, and how do you react to it? Is it just manipulation?
I just dont understsnd why people can be so numbed about this	Im feeling frustrated now	Its awesome how the mind can be.  Yesterday, I was in a public chat of lolquiters and someone began the ADHD topic.  I argued that some games; MMORPGs mainly, hiperstimulate you with stimulus and could help develop ADHD.  I was just talking about my experience with one concrete game, and then one of those huge gamer fanboys entered the scene.  He was lying and replying with sarcasm all the time.  I was replying politely with science knowledge but it was like talking to a wall.  He really wasnt listening.  For example, he said that there isban option to lower the amount of animations on the game (supposed to solve the problem).   <e1> I just dont understsnd why people can be so numbed about this </e1>  and  <e2> Im feeling frustrated now </e2> .  Wondering if that happened to anyone. 
Hello,	go.	Hello, first time posting here. This happened earlier today.  My exams just started, with English being the first.  About 1/3 of the way in time wise, but 3/4 through the exam materials I started freaking out.  I just couldn't calm down for the rest of the time in the exam. Any suggestions on how to avoid something like this happening again? I haven't had an anxiety attack before, and I still have 2 more exams to go. 
When	tips?	When you remember something embarrassing that happened to you during an interaction with someone, and think about it over and over for the rest of the day? I deal with this constantly, whether it be something that happened to me last week or last year.  Sometimes when I see someone I had an embarrassing moment with, I get very anxious and think that they will bring it up when they probably don't even remember it.  How do you deal with this? As someone with social anxiety, I constantly go over and over with these moments and I don't know how to stop it.  Any tips?
Hoping	ago	Hoping this might strike a chord with someone who is considering quitting, but is hesitant to try.  I've tried quitting three different times before this.  Once I lasted a month, had just one and then. . . you know the rest.  Two weeks ago
The	subject	The morbid alterations to which attention is subject
I wrote out the details of it all but just erased it	it doesn't matter	Two nights ago my NMom--also a violent alcoholic--kicked the shit out of me in front of my dad, who did nothing.   <e1> I wrote out the details of it all but just erased it </e1>  because  <e2> it doesn't matter </e2> .  She's done this before.  She's trying to manipulate my money, my health, my future, everything.  And to make it worse, she kicked me in my stomach, where I just had surgery about 2 weeks ago.  I had to call my doctor and make sure it was okay before carrying on, and here my mother is, acting like nothing happened and drinking merrily again. I hate her.  I'm just done with the abuse.  I have my burner cell phone, I have the car packed, and I'm going to disappear from her life.  Any advice or support is appreciated, this is my first time posting here. 
I hate that I have to give up a med that seems to work	it triggers a really bad side effect	I hate it.  The manics, the depression.  I hate it all. I hate the fat that I haven't been able to hold down a solid job in years.  I hate having to cycle  on and off meds just to see what works.   <e1> I hate that I have to give up a med that seems to work </e1>  because  <e2> it triggers a really bad side effect </e2> . I hate all of it.  Sorry for this rant I needed to get it off my chest. 
I am afraid to take days off work	if something goes wrong I am not there to fix it	Right i am facing a fear, im taking it as exposure therapy. . . . .   <e1> I am afraid to take days off work </e1>  because  <e2> if something goes wrong I am not there to fix it </e2>  but ive been taking fluoxetine for a week now and it has made me so sick that I have to stay home today! I hope i make it until tomorrow morning in one sane piece :(
Since	suggestions?	Since I've made the decision not to medicate my psych wants me to try mindfulness therapy but it really doesn't sound like something that's going to help me in the areas I feel I have deficits.  I don't get racing thoughts, don't feel any need to calm my mind.  My biggest issues are with lack of motivation, procrastinating, time management and disorganisation.  Basically the key executive function problems.  Pretty much the moment I read, bring a yoga mat I got very skeptical about this therapy and how it will actually help me.  Any suggestions? 
they can no longer get to me at all	I have their numbers/email blocked and I don't do social media	Hello RBN thanks once again for being here for me.  I have been NC for a few years now but that doesn't stop the Nparents from from trying to contact me.  Since I recently changed jobs  <e1> they can no longer get to me at all </e1>  as  <e2> I have their numbers/email blocked and I don't do social media </e2> .  The new insane tactic is to send friend requests to my wife on Facebook and to call her at work.  The messages are always left after hours and consist of things such as happy birthday wishes that are said in a seething menacing tone.  Thankfully my wife is supportive and ignores this stupidity.  It still sends chills through me every time I hear about it though.  Just wanted to vent about an intolerable and anxiety producing situation.  I wish you all peace.  Stay strong.  
Are	this?	Are there any people out there who have ADHD and are introverts? Before I was diagnosed with ADHD I always associated it with extrovertism.  I am on the complete opposite end of the spectrum and prior to my diagnosis I was extremely reclusive.  I liked my own time to do my own thing and felt overwhelmed if I spent too much time with other people.  Are there any other people with ADHD on reddit who are like this? 
it's also impacting my ability to work	I'm just constantly exhausted	TL;DR: I'm always tired, no matter how much or how little sleep I'm getting, and coincidentally my job is not suited to my ADHD - could the two be linked? Do you have similar experiences?So recently, over the past three or four months now, I've been feeling so tired, just all the time.  It's making doing social things really difficult, and  <e1> it's also impacting my ability to work </e1>  because  <e2> I'm just constantly exhausted </e2> . I have been to the doctor, who ran some blood tests, and all of those came back fine (which was a pleasant surprise) and I'm on a 6 month waiting list to see a sleep specialist.  In the mean time, I've started wondering whether it may be linked to my ADHD?The job that I do is a relatively slow paced office job, with limited variance in the tasks that are performed.  I work in an open plan office, and the majority of my coworkers do not understand the challenges of having ADHD (some are in the hat's the naughty kid thing
My doctor offered to fill out 3 months worth (most they can do) but I declined	I was worried about having money for travel and other expenses that come with relocating	Hi,I moved overseas a month ago, I took about 6 weeks worth of medication with me.   <e1> My doctor offered to fill out 3 months worth (most they can do) but I declined </e1>  as  <e2> I was worried about having money for travel and other expenses that come with relocating </e2> .  I contacted the local doctors here and they were not able to arrange for me to have my prescription refilled before setting off traveling for 6 weeks.  It's been about 3, and in a few days I will run out.  Im seeking advice on two parts. 1.  Coming off Vyvanse? I'm worried about getting huge food cravings (food here can be expensive if not planned well) as well as being generally useless and not being able to read or draw (two things I want to do a lot of while I'm on holiday)2.  Does anyone have any experience traveling in Norway and having prescriptions refilled?
I need to hear some success stories	I don't feel like my life is always going to be filled with me staying up way too late on the internet posting stupid shit	I know I need to keep a steady routine, but you guys already know the worst part about ADHD is how ironic it is. . .  the exact thing you need the most is the exact thing you have the hardest time giving yourself. So  <e1> I need to hear some success stories </e1>  so  <e2> I don't feel like my life is always going to be filled with me staying up way too late on the internet posting stupid shit </e2> , that I'll be able to keep a normal sleeping pattern and exercise routine. . .  in short, give me hope that life can get better if I do it right!!(I really want to commit to changing my life this summer vacation but I'm afraid it'll just be another broken promise to myself. )

Yesterday I got so overheated that I couldn't cool down, and felt really light-headed	This is making me nervous about the upcoming summer heat and humidity	I've been taking methylphenadate (ritalin, then concerta) since about November.  This week was the first 30+ degree weather in my city (86F).   <e1> Yesterday I got so overheated that I couldn't cool down, and felt really light-headed </e1> .  I was indoors most of the day!  <e2> This is making me nervous about the upcoming summer heat and humidity </e2> .  I don't have AC and my apartment electricity is too wimpy to support a unit.  I read that it's a thing that stimulants can increase heat sensitivity, but is there anything I can do to mitigate it? edit: Link keeps breaking.   netwellness. org/healthtopics/pharmacy/w18. cfm

I think about smoking all day and have turned to reading these posts to try and help me through this.

I've become so numb to the amount of gun violence that occurs here	I feel like a sociopath	I am queer.  Although I live on the other side of the country, I feel as though I should be in mourning right now.  My Facebook feed is overwhelmed with condolences and anger regarding the circumstances of today's shooting.  Meanwhile, I am more concerned about what I'm going to do after work tonight.   <e1> I've become so numb to the amount of gun violence that occurs here </e1>  that  <e2> I feel like a sociopath </e2> .  That I'm just not tuned into the same emotional 'frequency' as most people.  I don't even feel depressed at the moment, but I feel like this is the only place where I can talk about this without being immediately dismissed for being selfish. 
it's so hard to get out and interact	I feel all alone	I don't know why.  The past few weeks have been hell - nothing has happened, no trauma.  I just feel an intense loneliness and dread of the future.  I feel weak, sick almost.  I just can't avoid these thoughts of ending it.  Getting drunk all the time, lots of drugs.  It's when I'm sober that I can stand to be alive.  Everything seems so empty and hollow, and because  <e1> it's so hard to get out and interact </e1> ,  <e2> I feel all alone </e2> .  I feel like a pitiful person and I just don't want to put up with daily defeats, waking up and feeling like shit all day, trying to find some reason to keep going.  It's just not there anymore.  I've been here before, but I'm worse now than I was then.  It's not like I've got a family or anything.  No responsibilities.  It would be like I never had existed.  I've been like this for four years, no one wants to be a drag on everybody else for so long.  I'm a problem.  It's easier and easier every day to imagine death.  
It	tasks?	It seems to me that I have the biggest inconsistency when it comes to work, games, and   other items.  Is there a possible way to keep myself more consistent in certain tasks?
*Always* have someone you can talk to or somewhere you can turn to	you don't end up feeling lonely and even worse	I doubt that many, if any, of us have never had the issue of socially withdrawing at some point.  Whether it was while actively using, during any ensuing depression/anxiety/withdrawal, feeling guilty about a relapse, or for any other reason:# # #   <e1> *Always* have someone you can talk to or somewhere you can turn to </e1> , so that  <e2> you don't end up feeling lonely and even worse </e2> . 
Normally	vyvanse?	Normally I'm prone to anxiety that makes me more reactive than responsive.  Vyvanse only slightly helped - even in 40 mg.  I can't sit down and focus on my task.  I felt less cloudy with vyvanse but it didn't slow down my thoughts and actually put my head down and do the work.  How does aderall xr work vs vyvanse?
I feel like it definitely contributed to my alcoholism	I felt like what I was doing was kinda bullshit but I stayed in it for the money	This is kind of small rant, but I just need to get this out.  Today is my last day at a job I've had for 8 years.   I was 28 years old when I started.   It was a type of luxury sales - we'll just call it that.   Something I never really liked or connected with, but something that was fairly lucrative, and also fairly high stress.    <e1> I feel like it definitely contributed to my alcoholism </e1> , because  <e2> I felt like what I was doing was kinda bullshit but I stayed in it for the money </e2> .   So, think lack of purpose/meaning combined with a good income. . .  and a lot of alcohol to fill the empty spots. I leave today, and will be heading back to my homestate to help care for my mother who has Alzheimer's.   Seeing her decline has been absolutely heart breaking.   However, she is still Mom in so many ways
i'm thinking of just stopping cold turkey at this point	i really don't get physical withdrawal symptoms	i'll keep it short and simple. - 1. 5 years of drinking roughly 15 drinks a day, worse on weekends- down to about 8 drinks per day this past couple of weeks, that'd be the high end. - alcohol detox sites on the internet and their scare tactics stop me from not drinking, i can't afford (financially) detox.  - no, i don't have a GP either.  <e1> i'm thinking of just stopping cold turkey at this point </e1> , since  <e2> i really don't get physical withdrawal symptoms </e2>  that i'm aware of.  maybe very minor shakes if i hold my hands out still, but most of my drinking is done in a binge period a day (3 hours)not sure what i'm looking for by posting this. 
I'm	guys	I'm currently prescribed 5mg of dexamphetamine, and although it does help me sit down and focus on the work I'm trying to do, I still manage to screw around and avoid actually starting my work.  When I do eventually get started, I burn out after working for about an hour (with MANY breaks).  I'm seeing my psych in a few weeks and he will probably increase my dose, but I was hoping some fellow ADHDers could provide some insight into how to possibly avoid burning out so quickly.  Thanks guys
No	step.	No matter what good things happen, I can't fill in that huge hole in my soul.  I feel so empty like nothing will make me content with life.  I have an awesome wife who supports me  and loves me but I can't help feel like there is more out there.  I'm super stressed about money as I started a new business with two partners and it is taking forever to get of the ground.  I think I have made the biggest mistake of my life.  I feel like I'm a massive disappointment to everybody in my life.  I keep thinking of taking that final step. 
My	friends?	My child doesn't read social queues and he is shy and quite (nice) but now I find him in his room most days and I hate that there is not a friend.   How do I help him make friends?  What kind of friend will understand him? How do I teach him to make friends?
I	it.	I just want all of this to end, i want to die but im too afraid to actually go through with it and i hate it. 
I've been trying to stay busy	I can avoid MDD	 <e1> I've been trying to stay busy </e1>  so  <e2> I can avoid MDD </e2>  but it's extremely hard.  It's like an ex drug addict having to live with drugs always with them.  We can't get away from our minds.  Whether I'm doing the dishes or driving, I seem to fall into daydreaming without even trying.  I have noticed that the only time that I don't daydream is when I do meditation or smoke pot.  What are other experiences with smoking pot and daydreaming? Does it throw you into a daydream further or calm your mind enough not to daydream?I've been trying to run or do some kind of workout when I feel overwhelmed with my thoughts.  Thats been quite helpful.  I also try to stay busy cleaning or doing some form of a project or working on my business.  What kinds of things has anyone else tried to get out of their thoughts?
I	taste.	I want to be free from anxiety.  I want to go to rock concerts.  I want to take a chance.  I want to be talkative.  We both love rock songs, but I'm just too shy for her taste.

I'm supposed to be moving out of state by the end of the summer, but we don't have an apartment yet	which makes all the other planning difficult	Hey all, I'm in one of those crisis is still very avoidable but I need to reach out sort of places.  I've been feeling a little stress, lately.   <e1> I'm supposed to be moving out of state by the end of the summer, but we don't have an apartment yet </e1> ,  <e2> which makes all the other planning difficult </e2> . In addition, my girlfriend and I had a pretty big financial scare last week ,although we came out okay.  Add to that work stress, change of season and everybody wanting to talk politics, and I'm a little anxious and having trouble sleeping and being motivated.  I know I have the skills to deal with it, and that this will pass, but I'm feeling needy tonight and would really appreciate waking up to a story or two about a time someone successfully coped with stress. 
Hiya	real?Thanks!	Hiya Community, Sometimes when I am having a day full of flashbacks and anxiety, I get some real clarity of why these memories hurt so much, and the damage they have done to me.  However, I am not sure how to talk about it.  I want to talk about it, but I choke up and cry and sputter.  I am thinking about writing this stuff down and re-visiting it later.  I am afraid if I were to tell the person who hurt me in the past my thoughts, that it may damage them.  Should you tell the people that hurt you the revelations that you have had, or should you keep them in a notebook? How real is too real?Thanks! 
it just happened to me.  somebody from california trying to call me out here in texas	i get really anxious and even worried	 <e1> it just happened to me.  somebody from california trying to call me out here in texas </e1> .  i ignored it, like i do all numbers i don't recognize, but every time,  <e2> i get really anxious and even worried </e2> .  what could they want? was it a prank call? was it one of those scary and awful debt collectors i hear so much about? could it even have been some random person trying to threaten me? i'm under the mindset that there are terrible people like that in this world.  then again, it could have been just a wrong number or a robo call.  but i still can't help but get a little scared when it happens. . . 
The lack of success in life - socially, educationally, employment -	I've been a complete shut-in	 <e1> The lack of success in life - socially, educationally, employment - </e1>  is the main reason why  <e2> I've been a complete shut-in </e2> .  When I hear that my friends are graduating college I should be happy but it sends me into a anxiety riddled state.  It's a trigger because that's what I want but this disability is an anchor.  The feeling of complete helplessess leads to complete hopelessness - and unimaginable embarrassment. 
So	weird?	So I recently started a new job that I really like and I feel I'm performing well at.  Whenever I talk to my boss though I feel like there is some sort of communication disconnect.  She seems like a nice person, but she's kind of distant in what happens with everybody's work, she leaves that to the cell leaders.  But whenever I do happen to see her and talk with her the conversation always seems kind of awkward.  I'm not sure if it's like that because of me or her, or maybe both of us.  But I'm worried she thinks I'm weird.  Would a boss fire somebody that they think is weird?
I guess I don't want to share more	I'm more afraid of a diagnosis than help	When you've felt unsatisfied by your work or your personal relationships.  I think I like my job and I think I like my friends/family, but I've been on the brink of suicide in the past and. . .  now this morning, I guess.   <e1> I guess I don't want to share more </e1>  because  <e2> I'm more afraid of a diagnosis than help </e2> .  I'm just not feeling well. 
Warning:	Haha	Warning: not the most organized post.  It's a foggy day for me.  There's tl;dr if you need it.  I was diagnosed a few months ago, but originally didn't have a treatment plan appointment scheduled until July.   I worked reception at a nail salon and was constantly worried about losing my job because of the way ADHD effected my job performance.  I was great at my job overall, but I would get comments from the nail techs like, Haha
can anyone reassure me that	my cat is still alive and kicking (although she seems to be suffering from teething pain) days after giving me a bloody wound	First of all, fuck those who know for certain that I suffer from OCD yet keep yapping about rabies in my strictly indoors 4-mo old kitty.  I'd have gone all go fuck yourself if she wasn't a relative of mine. And secondly. . .   <e1> can anyone reassure me that </e1>  since  <e2> my cat is still alive and kicking (although she seems to be suffering from teething pain) days after giving me a bloody wound </e2>  there's simply no risk of rabies at all?
I'm	someone.	I'm having my first therapy session this week and I know in my head that it will be helpful, but I'm nervous about actually voicing all my concerns to someone.  
We just went from 3mg to 4. 5mg	hopefully the hallucinations will stop	I get headaches and am constipated as all hell.  But I feel less manic, more in control, and generally better.  Mild hallucinations, but nothing like my previous manic episode.   <e1> We just went from 3mg to 4. 5mg </e1> .  so  <e2> hopefully the hallucinations will stop </e2> .  The headaches respond to tylenol and may be a ransitional side effect that will stop. It knocks me out at night but I don't feel hungover in the morning.  That's really nice.  IDK what to say
I need to go get wine	he won't be here to get it	Regardless of when you decided to stop.  I'd say my first *Woah* moment was when my boyfriend, aka wine dealer, was going out of town.  I woke up the morning he was supposed to leave and one of my first thoughts was, * <e1> I need to go get wine </e1>  because  <e2> he won't be here to get it </e2> . * I was kind of like *Why would I be concerned about this first thing in the morning? Why is this what I'm most concerned with while he's gone?*Anyway, have a beautiful, sober day. 
I'm	food!	I'm racking up clean time and after being practically malnourished it feels amazing to put down some food!

Hi,	helplessness.	Hi, sometimes I get like randomly super anxious about death and dying.  I all of a sudden feel empty and lonely, and start spiraling.  It is almost like a helpless or hopeless feeling.  Can anyone relate?It makes me feel like a child or child-like.  Almost like I regress to a state of anxiety and helplessness.  
Hey	advance.	Hey r/ADHD.  Second attempt at this.   I'm curious to know if anyone has made use of an ADHD coach and had any success with them.  I'm serious considering using one, to help with goal setting and holding me accountable.  I think the 2 main problems are assistance in clarity regarding specific vocational selection within the scope of my ADHD, strengths and weakness, and also for some life coaching too include managing self esteem, motivation and discipline. I'm interested in knowing if anyone has used one before and if it helped.  Some questions for you would be: How did you choose your coach, as in what were the determining factors? How did they help you? Did you reach your goals? How did it help with managing your ADHD? What was the end result of the journey? Did they leave you in a better place than they found you? Was it worth the money?Thanks in advance. 
I	dying.	I feel like i'm choking right now.  I feel so so so guilty and not even for a specific reason.  I can't shake that off.  i feel like i'm dying. 
her father is an alchoholic and has been for as long as she can remember	it's been wearing her down immensely	My best friend recently told me that  <e1> her father is an alchoholic and has been for as long as she can remember </e1> , and  <e2> it's been wearing her down immensely </e2> .  She feels like she has nowhere to turn and when she confronted her dad, he shrugged it off and her mom only said she would talk to him.  I want to be able to help her but I have no idea where to start and it really sucks to see her so hopeless.  How can I help give her support or resources without overstepping bounds? For what it matters we are both seniors in high school.  
Trying	work	Trying to keep this short.  Don't Want to Waste too much time.  I can't stay at this job.  12 hours of mentally exhausting work is a good (short) day.  Overnight,4 days a Week.  school is the same.  so 9pm through 9 am is work.  10 am though 3pm is school. I can't keep track at all.  I can't manage to study.  Failing exams is easy when you're up 14 hours before (if you slept at all)I can't leave either.  Health insurance is amazing.  Medication where I can't remember the last time I curled up crying on my bed from an anxiety attack.  My paycheck supports my wife with no financial stress. I'm 25 years old and ready to go.  Heart problems, horrible teeth, pre-diabetic, and now failing in life, work, and school.  I have no discipline, No motivation and no hope. I'm tired of It will all work out! or You just have to get over it! I want the 'follow this and stop being a miserable human being checklist. Too easy though.  Just make it work
So	appreciated	So i recently started low dose straterra as in 10 days ago.  at first i felt great after a few days  i started feeling like i had a head cold, doc says i had viral infection.   from what i've read this is rather common.   i wonder if it has to do with tyrosine deficiency.    Also i notice i stress about a ton of junk and wonder if thats part of my ADHD or just preventing me from dealing with it effectively.    any relevant input is appreciated  
I want to back out	prevent this cycle from happening again	For some reason, all the people I end up incredibly attracted to enough to want to pursue a relationship with end up having BPD.  My only three serious partners have had it, and all have been mutually obsessive and toxic relationships, and every time I try and date somebody without BPD I get bored and disinterested way too quickly and end it, and just move onto the next fling, rinse, wash, repeat.   I wish I could have a healthy relationship with somebody, but I only ever fall in love with somebody who is just as unstable as I am and it always ends as a huge disaster.  Now it seems like it's happening again with this new girl I've met and  <e1> I want to back out </e1>  to  <e2> prevent this cycle from happening again </e2> , but being with somebody with BPD, no matter how unstable the relationship may be, makes me feel understood and loved.  I feel like nobody would be able to love me once they learn I have BPD, and I can't blame them. . . 
I	relate?	I have quite a few friends, and whenever they are talking to one another, I feel like even though I am in the conversation, I am not the same as them? like they are all having a conversation and I am just there, even if I contribute to it- its hard to explain- its like I am empty in a conversation unless I am just with one person that I know well, otherwise it I space apart from everybody else.  anybody relate?
For	Thanks.	For a couple weeks, I've really been thinking about ending it all.  I've got no one in my life that cares about how I'm feeling at any given moment.  My purpose in life has been to just service other people.  Whenever someone needed a ride, weed, advice, I was there for everyone no matter what.  Now that I'm trying to get better and get some people that I can talk to, suddenly everyone is too busy for me, yet all my friends hang out with each other.  My parents only care about me getting good grades and not causing drama.  My sister tells me at least once a week how she wishes I was dead.  Last year after her birthday party she told me how when she blew out the candles she wished I would die.  She's only 12 yet she's the meanest person in my life.  The only person I talk to I have to pay $ 40 a week.  My life is a fucking joke.  I wish I was dead so someone better can take my spot.  I'm just ranting here.  Thanks.  
I am in this for the long haul, on the front lines, actually the only line	it's all up to me	Yesterday evening and all through last night I was in a low mood.  My insecurities were on high, self doubt, loneliness even when not alone.  I didn't drink and wasn't especially tempted but then did dream of being served a VERY long stemmed glass of wine (whatever that means).  I am clear that drinking will only worsen and maybe legitimize the feeling.  This is where I think courage and strength really kick in, it's easy enough to ride on the good feeling high of waking up sober while on the crest of a mood cycle.  I committed to feeling everything in all it's actual strength and proving to myself that I can handle it, I don't need to duck away when things feel bad.   <e1> I am in this for the long haul, on the front lines, actually the only line </e1> . . . because  <e2> it's all up to me </e2> .  I am driving this thing to victory.  I will go to bed alcohol-free tonight no matter what highs or lows today brings.   
I	sensations?	I mean when my main OCD was HOCD(gay ocd) sometimes i was feeling some kind of sensations in my genitals area i can't really describe it but it was always in inapropriate time.  It was not erection but some sort of weird feeling in that area. Also now i am afraid that i might have brain cancer and sometimes i have weird feelings in my head.  Doctor says i'm pretty much fine and my head is alright but i do get these werid feelings.  Especially if i'm reading about cancer, at these moments i get more of these weird feelings. So can OCD create different bodily sensations?
I	again.	I keep on having to run on lines over and over again until it feels right, then I can move on and do what I was gonna do.  It's such a pain in the ass.  Also having to align the camera with a certain edge of something over and over again.

~	feedback!	~ I'm new to Reddit so idk if there's already a post about this ~Does anyone else get this? Ever since I was little I would get really obsessed with things like TV shows or audio cassettes (Harry potter stories), to the point where I would need to spend all of my free time engaging with them, otherwise I would feel sad.  I still get this now, but mostly only if I'm somewhere unfamiliar, like on vacation, or if I'm feeling low.  Even if I might want to do something else, I'll feel really reluctant to do it because I'll have to tear myself away from that certain TV series (or whatever). I'm not sure if this makes any sense at all. Please give me feedback!
literally my mom has given up on me	that's out of the question	I want to vent my feelings out and need help, I'm sorry for the lack of context.  I promised my teachers that I'd come to school, after 3 days, Ive been at home for 3 weeks and Exams On Sunday.  last year I promised them I'd come, but I've only been to school for a month/31 days in just a school year, according to a teacher. I'm not just anxious about Exams, but I'm also anxious about the teachers, I haven't been to school yet and the Exams coming, this is not the first time it has happened, but I'm feeling really down today, I was also too anxious to share it on reddit, but I've gotten through it. Consulting a Therapists, or psychologists are out of the question where I live,  <e1> literally my mom has given up on me </e1>  so  <e2> that's out of the question </e2> 
I	feeling.	I don't need my nmothers approval, but it would be nice to have her proud of me for once. Thought it was better sharing it with you guys.  You can relate to what I'm feeling. 
He said he's feeling better after our chat, but I feel worse	he thanked me for being his friend	I want to take everything back I said to the man I love.  I still want to kill myself.  I guess, technically, if I'm not here I won't have to worry about what he does.   <e1> He said he's feeling better after our chat, but I feel worse </e1> .  I think it's because  <e2> he thanked me for being his friend </e2> .  That kicked me in the heart.  I want to be more, but he doesn't do long distance relationships.  I feel like I should just walk away, but I'm too weak to do that.  I keep hoping I will get a job, and we will start talking about moving in together.  I'm mad at him,  but I still love him.  I'm so stupid. 
I decided to email him after watching them	I just had to fucking tell him.  Here's what I sent	The title may seem weird, but hear me out.  I've been suicidal since I was 10 (now 17).  I have had a recent surge in these thoughts after having escaped them for a year or two.  I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a few weeks now, and I watched the two most depressing markiplier videos that exist.  I haven't ever watched him.  I've seen clips, I know of him, I just don't really watch youtubers.  One of the videos was about a game about suicide, called The Static That Speaks My Name, and the other was a kinda PSA he made after his friend committed suicide.   <e1> I decided to email him after watching them </e1> , because  <e2> I just had to fucking tell him.  Here's what I sent </e2> . Hi Mark! I wanted to let you know something that I hope will make your day. Recently
I am starting to feel better	I finally surrendered	This post is in reference to the past week or two - I have dived right into some seriously heavy depression and anxiety, manifesting last week at its worse in the form of physical illness.  But  <e1> I am starting to feel better </e1> , just because  <e2> I finally surrendered </e2>  and said to myself: It is silly for you to think you are superman and can will this away.  Wave the white flag and go back to help.  With the confluence of issues I have going on right now, including debt I cannot pay, shaky times at work, and pretty bad G. I.  problems (made much worse by anxiety and depression), I am ready to make a plan and go.  Let's do this - I would like to be a part of a community who understands.  Here is a snip of a reply I wrote in regards to the question: Is feeling bad acceptable in society?: Around four months ago
I	yourself?	I think I make people sad or negative, so I stay away from friends and family, but then it gets lonely.  Who are we meant to talk to if the only person you have is yourself?
I've never been diagnosed with anxiety	I've never gone to see anyone about it	 <e1> I've never been diagnosed with anxiety </e1> , mostly because  <e2> I've never gone to see anyone about it </e2> .  But over the course of my dating life, I've always been nervous that I'm being cheated on, or that my S. O.  is looking for a way out.  My reasoning always being that it was MY FAULT, that IM not good enough. Well one day I ended up being right.  I was young (15) and in an online relationship with a guy I thought I was in love with.  I got so over-hyped
I	right.	I still fucking hate myself.  I'm still miserable no matter what I do.  I graduated last year and haven't done anything. Nothing makes me feel better.  I'm still a fucking loser.  I'm still a kissless virgin.  I can't fucking do anything right. 
You	lol	You know? Or like, forget to do something major.  Not that it would even matter lol.  I'm mostly just afraid of attempting suicide and being put in the hospital.  I'm so over it!!! Wish there was a ragequit button for life lol
I'm unable to think clearly and decisively	my problem solving/planning skills just drop into the closest toilet	Hi all! So I've had anxiety/OCD for 6 years and one consistent thing I've noticed is that I often get incredibly overwhelmed if I have to plan anything.  It can be something as simple as planning the meals and matching grocery list for the week for me and my partner.  My stomach just fills up with what feels like an anchor, throat closes and  <e1> I'm unable to think clearly and decisively </e1>  so  <e2> my problem solving/planning skills just drop into the closest toilet </e2> .  I then often come up with a really inefficient, roundabout plan, or an incomplete plan. . .  Does anybody else have a similar experience? Or any advice for how to problem solve/plan well despite anxiety?Thanks for reading!

He inherited her depression and was often the one taking care of her	his dad didn't believe in depression	My SO is 22, I am 20.  We've known each other for five years and we've been dating for three.  We are long-distance.  Phil has been through some serious shit in his life.  His dad is ex-army and abrasive (he's calmed down now, but he used to be really confrontational with Phil growing up) and his mom has depression.   <e1> He inherited her depression and was often the one taking care of her </e1>  because  <e2> his dad didn't believe in depression </e2> .  His dad would just scoff and go out for long walks when she had her episodes.  This led to a lot of tension between father and son and a few fistfights as Phil grew older.  His dad relentlessly pushed for him to be a man's man and did a lot of damage to his emotional growth.  Phil's first girlfriend was abusive and raped him.  He went to his dad
My	for.	My fathers voice is in my head.  13 years he told me how worthless I am, how stupid I am, how I'll always be a failure, how much he hates me, how much of a regret having me was.  He moved away, miles and miles away.  But his voice is still in my head.  Every time i fail at something I hear him.  Every time I'm proud of myself he shoots it down.  He tells me to cut, and then tells me how I'm only doing it for attention and how I'm insane and should be locked away.  How I'm a shame to him, how I can't be related to him.  Now his voice is telling me I don't even deserve to live.  MY voice is telling me how easy it would be to die.  I'm only 15.  Please help me, please.  I've wanted to die before but it's never been this bad all I can think about it how it would feel and I can't sleep and I just please does anyone even care, I just need something to keep living for. 
I'm	retailers?	I'm from Florida but here in NJ on sort of a work-vacation for the next 6 weeks.   I have about 15 Adderall XR 10 mg left that I was trying to stretch out until I get back to Florida (August 9th), but that doesn't look like it's gonna happen. I have a script for my meds, anyone have problems getting it filled here in NJ with an out of state prescription?Suggestions?  I normally get it filled at either a CVS or Walgreens down in Florida, should I stick with those retailers?

I am constantly over thinking and always have something on my mind.  I feel like things are impossible and I have trouble getting motivated.  I get tense and irritated very easily.  I just want to know what I could do about this.  Where can I go to get officially diagnosed, medicated or helped? If you would like to comment on some of my symptoms or ask questions, please go ahead and do so.  Thanks
Has	happened?	Has anyone here struggled with dealing with positive stress (like excitement) that still causes nervous energy and anxiety? Something really great has happened to me, or rather will be happening on Friday, but I think that excited tension is triggering anxiety.  Nuts, right? Any ideas on how I can rein it in and just enjoy what's happened?
I developed gallstones young, but wasn't diagnosed for over two weeks	my mom thought I had kidney stones and that she could cure me by making me drink vinegar	 <e1> I developed gallstones young, but wasn't diagnosed for over two weeks </e1>  because  <e2> my mom thought I had kidney stones and that she could cure me by making me drink vinegar </e2> . She's very into alternative medicine. It took two weeks of my near constant pain/vomiting for her to finally take me in to the doctor and get a proper diagnosis. Before my cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal surgery), I would still get attacks now and then.  She seemed very concerned if the pain was an 8 or a 9?!?!.  She would follow me from my bed to the bathroom
get angry with us	not doing anything	I apologize if this isn't the most appropriate forum, but I am desperate for insight on this from people who actually struggle with it or support those who do.  My family and I want to help my sister more than anything, but are at a total loss.  She was diagnosed last year and has done a couple stays at a nearby psych clinic, which she of course hated.  Even the times when she asked to go.  She'd call the next day, blaming us for putting her in there and  <e1> get angry with us </e1>  for  <e2> not doing anything </e2>  but hrow money at the situation.  Even when we've tried family therapy or one on one counseling or conversations in private
If	mother?	If I talk to my mom again and move back in.  Would my life be like it was before she kicked me out? Or will be even worse off?I'm desperate to go back to the good days.  Even by doing something like this.  Should I get back in contact with my mother? 
can not drive alone or go anywhere without my safe people	not sure how to begin treatment	Hey all.  I'm new to this sub.  I have had agoraphobia for many years.  I am afraid of driving alone and staying alone.  Just wanted to come here and read others experiences.  I want to be well. .  <e1> can not drive alone or go anywhere without my safe people </e1>  so  <e2> not sure how to begin treatment </e2> .  Plus money issues.  :/
I'm	THEN.	I'm depressed and basically depending on benzos to keep it together at this point.  I only work part-time, but I'm moving next month which precludes finding another job.   My hobbies have become work and staled in front of my eyes.   I can't even pick up a book.   I do have a psych, meds, a therapist. . .  everybody just says Wait until you move and find a new job, things will get better.  I'm terrified that this will get the better of me and I'll eff up any new job I get, not to mention I DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO UNTIL THEN.  
I don't want a fucking sympathy hug	im fucking depressed I just want someone to care about me that doesn't know I am this sad	I want someone just to hug me that doesn't know how terrible I feel, who doesn't know it means to me.   <e1> I don't want a fucking sympathy hug </e1>  because  <e2> im fucking depressed I just want someone to care about me that doesn't know I am this sad </e2> .  so fucking lonely. 
It	.	It seems that for quite some time I haven't felt happy or excited or felt any positive emotions.  I am either sad, stressed, angry or don't feel anything at all.  Anyone else in that realm of nothing really affects you one way or another, numb.  Just can't feel happiness or motivation? I feel like each day I am waiting to go sleep so I can wake up the next day and keep burning time until something happens.  I don't know what I am waiting for, what that something is. . .  I know this last year of highschool I should be giving it my all while trying to experience new things and stuff but I just can't bring myself to do anything.  I habe trouble doing the bare minimum.  Just relying on what little intelligence I have to scrape by.  How do I get out of this place? This personal hell? I want to feel again, to be motivated but I can't find it.  I just want to sleep the day away. . . . 
Let's take a minute to remind ourselves of the positive things about ourselves	we have an awful tendency to ignore them	 <e1> Let's take a minute to remind ourselves of the positive things about ourselves </e1> , because  <e2> we have an awful tendency to ignore them </e2> . For example,* I give a shit* I'm resilient* I'm smart* I have a sense of humor* I'm articulat* I'm forgiving* I'm an optimist* I try to improve myself and am willing to look at myself through a critical lens* I put effort into my friendshipsTell me what you like about yourself!PS: props to /u/ssnakeggirl for the idea two weeks or so back over on /r/bipolarhealth (I really liked the idea and thought I'd bring it over here, but don't deserve credit for it)
I've	trick.	I've been in a pretty nasty rut for a couple years now for a multitude of reasons and I'm sick of just making it worse on myself.  Thing is, I feel like death the first half of the day and resolve to quit for real this time, but then evening comes around and I start wallowing in self-pity and end up caving.  I don't really have any support structure I can rely on and I'm reflexively secretive which doesn't help.  I don't usually have any trouble with things once I set my mind to it, but being so depressed has utterly sapped my willpower.  I just need some advice on overcoming the initial inertia.  Thanks!EDIT: Thank you all for your kind words yesterday.  Hopefully this subreddit will finally do the trick. 
I started seeing another guy who is lovely and understanding, and willing to wait	he was a virgin too	About a year ago I was raped by my previous partner (it's being investigated- don't worry) we split up and  <e1> I started seeing another guy who is lovely and understanding, and willing to wait </e1>  as  <e2> he was a virgin too </e2> .  He's told me he's ready to have sex and although I'm excited when I think of sex I think of what happened before.  Has anyone else had this and how have they moved past it? I know it won't ruin my relationships but I used to enjoy sex so much
My head is light and I'm kind of dizzy	the blood draw	Hi all,I just today had my first blood draw in years (I am 24) and I nearly fainted when it happened.  The nurse kept me with it and laid me down for a good while as she fanned me.  It took about 10 minutes, but I eventually got up and was on my merry way.  Now that I'm home I have this (and I know it to be irrational) irrational fear that I am going too faint.  <e1>  My head is light and I'm kind of dizzy </e1>  and I keep on telling myself this is because of  <e2> the blood draw </e2> .  When it doesn't go away it scares me into thinking its about to happen again even when I KNOW its not going to even two hours later.  I want to take a nap but its gnawing at the back of my mind.  I looked up the science behind fainting and I shouldn't be worried, but I am.  I know I have to be the pillar of strength to get through this nonsense, but I'm genuinely curious if this has happened to anyone else and how they responded.  Thank you.   
This	Also	This isn't even half of what I wanted to say.  But this seemed like a good start.  I haven't spoken to or seen him in a little over 2 years, and he recently texted me.  I took some time to think out something to say after receiving it.  Finally wrote something and sent it tonight.  I'm not afraid of him like I used to be when I was a kid.  But I'm feeling. . .  nervous.  : /This is what he said, followed by what I finally said.  Him: I'm all in. . . your my daughter and i love you and i will die for you. . . i just want our wounds to heal.  i am sorry i have let you down. Also
approached him	liked what he shared	Hello, I have a question regarding my sponsor.   He and I have been working together for a little over three months and I just celebrated 8 months of continuous sobriety.   I love AA and fully recognize it saved my life but the problem I have is that my sponsor and I rarely speak.   I initially  <e1> approached him </e1>  because I really  <e2> liked what he shared </e2>  at meetings and he was glad to help.   Initially we worked slow and I was OK with that, he isn't a call me every day to check in guy but I am now speaking to him once every week or every other week and rarely see him at meetings.   Don't get me wrong he is an awesome guy and has always picked up when have called its just I thought the whole sponsorship thing would be different.   To be honest I don't call him often so i can see why he may think I'm not invested in this but I assure you I am.   Perhaps I should be more aggressive but yet I have asked him once or twice if I am where I should be by now.   Also
kindling effect	withdrawal becomes harder	Hello, I am on day 45 after a 2. 5 week relapse, I was sober for 60 days previously.  I had kid myself into thinking I could be a rec user and one day fell into the addiction hard core once again.  This time the withdrawal is harder though and I was just wondering if anyone out there had some experience on withdrawal the second time.  I was doing research on PAWS and discovered something called the  <e1> kindling effect </e1>  where  <e2> withdrawal becomes harder </e2>  each time after relapse.  I have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep and waking up, and my fatigue during the day can be disabling.  I know that there are compounding factors, I think I have iron deficiency anemia which can cause similar symptoms, there are probably some other things going on too.  I am seeing a doctor soon.  But I am just curious is there is still withdrawal going on. . . last time I felt good after 30 days, so maybe this kindling effect is making it last longer, just wondering if I should rule out withdrawal or not from one of the possible causes of my fatigue. . . 
sucks	anxiety	Does anybody else get bored of things really easily? And impulsively think of the next big thing? For example I am really into fish tanks.  I have a big 120 gallon tank, and love having fish.  But I get so bored! First goldfish, then african cichlids, now I have a flowerhorn and just bought an eel.  Already bored! And I obesesivly research new fish.  Today I spent about 3 hours looking at saltwater fish.  Now I have to have them.  And it's not just that.  I'm never content and always get so bored of what I have and want something new.  It just  <e1> sucks </e1>  because I have really bad  <e2> anxiety </e2>  and I start freaking out thinking how impulsive I am and then shut down.  It's a vicious cycle.  Anybody else feel this way ever?
What	me.	What do I do when nothing helps? I am angry almost 24/7. I have tried the following:Audio-therapyMedicationNormal TherapyExerciseMeditationchanging my attitude (idk how that works)Removing myself from situations which make me angry (aka everything). Good dietAnd more that I can't think of.  What can I do? This is very unpleasant and really degrades my life and the lives of those around me. 
Many	relationship.	Many many times I get down on the fact that I sort of feel as if I could have done something differently, or that the fact that my ex BPSO acted so poorly because of something about me.  I know on some sort of level this isn't true, but it's very hard to fully internalize.  I'm 34 and have many moments where I feel I may have lost my best years or my last chance to have a real relationship.  
threatened to chuck me out my house last week but took it back	didn't want to see me in the streets	I live with my parents right now and we keep having arguments about alcohol.  They  <e1> threatened to chuck me out my house last week but took it back </e1>  as they probably  <e2> didn't want to see me in the streets </e2> .  I told my support worker last week that I drank three bottles of vodka in a week and she asked if I can try and not drink for the week and a half she's on holiday and I couldn't even do that.  I bought some today.  I feel like such a failure. 
One	on.	One of the best things I have done for taking care of my flashbacks is to plan for them.  I keep food in the house specifically for when I am too depressed to cook, things that require minimal to no preparation.  This helps me curb binge eating.  I buy healthy frozen dinners.  I like Amy's brand, they are very tasty and definitely the healthiest frozen food I can find without going to a specialty grocery store.  I also get snack food, like whole fruit and microwave popcorn.  The popcorn isn't the best thing, but it's sure an improvement on my old habit of walking to the corner store to buy Doritos and sour cream to binge on. 
forces me into a darker depression	art is a very important thing in my life	So over the past year I've felt like I've lost my skill to draw.  Painting used to be the same way but I feel like my ability to draw all together.  I try to sketch but I start to get angry that it never comes out good.  This just  <e1> forces me into a darker depression </e1>  as  <e2> art is a very important thing in my life </e2> .  I know the best way is to just keep trying but I feel useless.  I try everyday but I usually end up crying in my studio and feeling as if I've wasted supplies.  Anyone experience similar things?
I'm	alive!	I'm grateful and glad that so many people care about me. . I haven't been going to IOP in about 3 days, and I got a few messages from friends there. . I thought it was really sweet. . . they do miss me and we care about each other. Truly remarkable how much we truly do mean to each other!The friendships I've developed in every aspect of my recovery, even when I didn't even realize it. !Glad to be clean today. . glad to be anywhere clean!Including alive!
hate people telling me that something's unlikely to happen	chance that something bad's going to happen	A few days ago I picked up a book at a discount store about positive psychology (the study of how people with optimal mental health live their lives), didn't think much about it, but started reading.  I came across something called ['defensive pessimism']( wellesley. edu/Psychology/Norem/Quiz/quiz. html).  A defensive pessimist is someone (who typically has anxiety) who can easily imagine the different ways things can go wrong.  For them, lowering anxiety involves ruminating about all the worst case scenarios and preparing/bracing for them.  Crucially, *not* thinking about the worst-case scenario and setting positive or high expectations about the situation they're anxious about actually *raises* their anxiety levels.  Then we have the strategic optimist (people who typically don't have anxiety problems).  For them, the opposite's true.  If they dwell too much on worst-case scenarios, their anxiety increases. I'm, quite clearly, a defensive pessimist.  I  <e1> hate people telling me that something's unlikely to happen </e1> , because in my mind, there's *always* a  <e2> chance that something bad's going to happen </e2> , no matter how small.  And I wasn't a fan of CBT for this reason, though there are some techniques that might be useful, the majority of it was like, oh that's unlikely
sexually assaulted a few years ago by my (former) best friend and her boyfriend	struggling with long term depression	I was  <e1> sexually assaulted a few years ago by my (former) best friend and her boyfriend </e1> .  I won't be going into detail.  They nearly ruined my romantic relationship, my relationship with my family, and my reputation.  I was forced to remain friends with them for years.  Until I finally couldn't take it.  I called it what it was.  Rape.  I never reported it though.  I only came clean about it to a close group of friends.  For this they threatened to sue me for slander.  All is well now.  I no longer see them.  But I still get vivid flashbacks whenever something reminds me of them and I have been  <e2> struggling with long term depression </e2> .  
I'm	appointment?	I'm in my twenties and just got diagnosed and prescribed meds through my GP a few months ago.   Tomorrow is my first therapy appointment.  My fear is that I'll get dragged into a bout of depression if I have to discuss my childhood and pre-medication experiences.  I know counseling is an important supplement to medication.  I'm not trying to be a wimp either, but after two decades of working through my stuff independently I'm just afraid to rehash certain things.  I'm going to grit my teeth and work hard in counseling regardless, but have any of you had the same anxieties? What can I expect from a first appointment?
I	Dextroamphetamine.	I usually take Vyvance (50mg) per day.  Today I took 15mg of Dextroamphetamine in the morning and another 5mg of it at 2pm.  From about 3pm to 6pm I was so incredibly focussed and had no problem tidying on and off for hours.  I was not high, just not the lazy sloth that I usually am.  Tidying seemed really satisfying. The only bad thing was that about 4. 5 hours after the last pill I took, I suddenly got a terrible headache, a bit of nausea and really hungry.  I am rarely hungry on vyvance. Do any of you find you are more focussed and happy to tidy and do boring things on Dextroamphetamine. 
I'm	you	I'm listening to Tony Robbins right now on Netflix. I read self help books for years.  All I see is a pile of generalities (believe in yourself) wrapped in original (sometimes appealing) concepts. I don't know if I'm insensitive to self help or if I can't understand it or if I'm too defensive or if I'm an asshole or if it's just bullshit.  Or maybe I'm just applying self help to my life without noticing it. Self help didn't make me realize I had problems.  Self help didn't help me being sober.  Self help didn't help me losing those extra 35 lbs.  Self help didn't make me confident. I'm almost embarrassed to say it but I owe sobriety and being fit again to Reddit. I still want to be opened to self help so I'll listen to you
indignant	I couldn't see him clearly	This always come up the minute nMom and I are alone--once, my husband stepped out of the car to snap a picture, and nMom starts in on what a liar my dad was, an asshole, on and on (in fact he did have an affair--but they are both remarried now, and this was 34 years ago).  I asked for the 100th time for her to please not complain about my dad--our entire childhood, my GC sister and I would hear about it, and she would complain about him and tell us to ask him for more money etc.  She became  <e1> indignant </e1>  at my (much repeated) request and said that she was just trying to help me because  <e2> I couldn't see him clearly </e2> .  In truth she has no idea what my relationship with my father is--she would never ask! I then asked her if it ever occurred to her that the divorce had been hard on me too--not just on her.  She snorted in shock.  You still got to see him
haven't gotten to experience a non-narc paternal figure for a prolonged period of my life	jealous	Because I  <e1> haven't gotten to experience a non-narc paternal figure for a prolonged period of my life </e1> , whenever I interact with my friends' dads, who are so nice and kind and just GOOD at being DADS, I get a little  <e2> jealous </e2>  and just wish I had a dad like that. How has anyone else been able to cope with not having that central paternal or maternal figure? I don't have anyone else in my life even close to fulfilling the role, so I'm sort of lost as to where to look for a strong, healthy, male role model. . . 
I'm	grammar	I'm not quite sure why, but when we have dinner (Myself, SO, three kids), I find myself getting very easily frustrated with my children.    They eat &amp; act like children.    I understand this.   I'm about as laid back as they come, but for some reason this one thing is a trigger &amp; I don't want it to be.    I would like to be able to enjoy dinner, let the small stuff brush off my shoulders &amp; have a nice family time.   All other times of the day are good to go.   Kids do what kids do.   Sometimes bad, mostly fantastic.   This one thing is *eating* at me &amp; I'm curious if any of you experience similar situations &amp; how you let go. Edit:  missing word, grammar

No one knows  how lonely i am at work or home	try to be as happy and over the top as i can to fit in	Hi male 19 hereI never had a girlfriend or any Real friends i hangout with anymore.  Its mid summer and i havent gone out once.  All i do is work 6 days a week by the time i get back my dad is already alseep so i just sit in my room and get in my own head and by the 2 in the morning i am tearing up uncontrollably and i cant stand it anymore.  I feel like I have no one but my dad and especially no one to talk to.  On my day off i drive 4 hours to see my mom and her drunk of a boyfriend.   <e1> No one knows  how lonely i am at work or home </e1>  because i  <e2> try to be as happy and over the top as i can to fit in </e2> .  But in truth i dont know what to do anymore,   i just want to quit and start over. 
become a therapist	love the experience of helping people	I am so glad i found this page because reading some of the stuff that you guys have out is honestly crazy because i can relate so much to a lot of you.  I have never felt more understood so thank you &amp; also please if you ever need anything MESSAGE ME my career goal is to  <e1> become a therapist </e1>  so i would  <e2> love the experience of helping people </e2>  its my favorite thing to do.  I love love love getting to know people &amp; figuring out deeper issues as to why they are the way they are &amp; i don't know listening to people is something i love as well as giving advice.  So please come to me whenever you'd like or even snapchat me! I'll be that person you can fall back on :) 
don't cancel on them until the last minute	worried	A lot of the times, I'll bail out on plans with my friends.  This happens more when I'm farther away or need to make a trek to see my friends.  I don't get anxious, per se, but I get this feeling of annoyance and worry when I start thinking about plans I've made.  I  <e1> don't cancel on them until the last minute </e1>  though because I'm  <e2> worried </e2>  that they'll be mad or upset at me and dislike that feeling.  I also really dislike responding to texts, or calls from work.  I get anxious thinking about talking to my professors or older adults.  The weird thing is that sometimes I can be very friendly and almost mask this introverted side of myself
Every single night is no longer cut short	went to bed early after gunning down beers	Life is better without.  Energized. . . . . thoughts organized. . . . much more.  I am much more quiet at times.   <e1> Every single night is no longer cut short </e1>  for my 3 boys and wife because I  <e2> went to bed early after gunning down beers </e2> .  Im not as social with the normal party crowd. . . but in general when I am social. . I seem to make more sense and not be in such a hurry to get in and out of the conversation.  I am not going back to the old ways. . . . way too self centered. . I have so much to accomplish with my sons. . . . my glory days are over. . it should be all about the boys. . . . . Im 45 for the love of Mike and needed to and continue to need to stop acting like Im 30. 83 today
Does	sometimes.	Does anyone else struggle with this? It seems that after having kids and trying all sorts of new adhd meds, it's gotten worse.  I am hoping to find something that helps.  That being said, I do stupid things at the drop of a hat, and instantly regret it.  I hate this part of my adhd.  I honestly had worked so hard to create a habit of control, which has been derailed since my pregnancy.  I hope to get things under control once again.   Anyway, this is wearing on me, among other things and it effects my whole life.  I hope my husband truly understands I don't mean to do some of the things I do.  I mean, we don't fight, but I can tell he gets frustrated sometimes.  
I	something	I am finding myself in fights every other day and it is becoming extremely mentally taxing.  I am in a situation in life where a lot of people depend on me and my work, and I am happy to help others, but when someone treat me wrongly I will point it out, first in a calm and restrained way, but then if they don't grasp it I will totally go full on fuck you and fuck every ancestor you have for bringing you into existence type rage.  All my life logic and reason has been my anchors in this perpetual battle to stay grounded with ADHD.  The problem is that when I know I am logically right about something
My	it.	My longtime bf ignored my texts for about a month.  We are doing long distance and I texted him about once a week about the difficulties I was having.  I called him up the other day and he took it (mistaking me for someone else), and he acted like nothing was wrong.  This is not the first time this has happened - I feel completely  invalidated by the person I trusted the most, and even more worthless than before.   He is extremely busy, to be fair, and has said that he will only have time to message on the weekends.  We had a very stable, trusting relationship for the past 7 years.  But I feel like the final real personal connection I had with someone has finally broken down.  I have nobody else.  I am functioning but there is a gaping hole inside and everything is rotting.  I crawled out of this situation once but it happened again.  It will continue happening again and again, and this time I'll be alone.   I'm completely worthless and continuing to live just means restarting the vicious cycle.  It's not worth it.   
I've isolated myself from all of my friends	I thought it would be best	Now it's too late.  I'm 31, 4 kids and a wife and zero friends.  I tried to overdose when I was 19.  I obviously failed but did achieve fucking up my brain.   <e1> I've isolated myself from all of my friends </e1>  that I did have because  <e2> I thought it would be best </e2> .  Now Im craving friendship.  I'm convinced my wife is as unhappy as she's ever been even though she says she isn't.  I know better.  I'm a shit father.  I'm shit at my job.  I'm a shit husband.  I just wish I would have finished the job when I overdosed the first time.  Everyone would have forgotten about me and moved past my death by now.  
I've	you	I've always known that I tend to get unhinged and overly upset at situations.  I get very upset over nothing at all and usually after blowing up, I stay mad for a long long time despite the situations getting fixed.  Here's some examples 1.  I went shopping with my sister and nothing looked right and we had to leave the house soon.  I threw a fit.  I was throwing things and speaking badly about myself.  I mentioned I was hangry and my sister brought yogurt for us to eat and I looked at her like wtf is wrong with you
My psychiatrist prescribed me Ritalin and assured me it would also help me with my depressed and anxious feelings	they are probably caused by my ADD	 <e1> My psychiatrist prescribed me Ritalin and assured me it would also help me with my depressed and anxious feelings </e1> , as  <e2> they are probably caused by my ADD </e2> .  This made me wonder what other positive effects Ritalin (or other medication) has (in your experience), apart from an increased focus.  I noticed I don't eat out of boredom as often anymore, and I buy less random stuff impulsively.  My addiction to coffee has also completely faded, but it still helps as an extra push when I need it.  There's more but as I'm not sure if it's because of the meds or coincidence/placebo, I'm curious about your experiences. Google only gives me lists of negative side effects so that's why I'm asking it here.  :) (If anyone has comorbid anxiety/depression issues, I'd be glad to hear about your experiences with meds/therapy as well.  If it doesn't really fit this topic feel free to PM me)TL;DR What positive effects did you get from taking your meds, apart from an increased focus? 
Hello	offer?	Hello Everyone! I hope you are all well? Just joined the group so this question has possibly already been answered a million times and if it has I'm sorry in advance!  My wife and I have managed to make it to 35 years old without realising we both had ADHD.  Now I'm about to start medication (tomorrow morning) but my wife isn't (she is hoping to get pregnant again) and we are both worried that I am going to find her incredibly annoying once I start medicine.  Are there any other couples in similar scenarios with any advice to offer? 
Has	.	Has anyone tried this Barkley approach to the Pomodoro-style way of approaching tasks?  How did you respond to it?  Is there a way to set a timer on the phone to automatically keep this ratio?Edit: Also, what the heck do you do for a 3 minute reward?  Reddit?  I feel like that would either be not rewarding enough, or send me down into a spiral of nonsense. . . 
it's ultimately my fault	not trying or reaching out enough	I do nothing but sit by my computer or read books in this rural hellhole I live in.  I'm too afraid to message anyone I know in case they think I'm boring or depressing.  Nobody talks to me first anymore.  I'm starting my last year of high school in August and I have no plans for what to do afterwards.  I never thought my life would still be this dreary when I was younger, and I know  <e1> it's ultimately my fault </e1>  for  <e2> not trying or reaching out enough </e2> . Consider this a vent post I guess, god knows I needed to write it out somewhere. 
That	that	That is the answer I usually give when people (well, the very few people I ever interact with) ask me why I'm not looking so happy. I don't know if I'll be able to keep up this facade in the next months. . .  I've used this excuse for years, now.  These are just empty words. I'm not just tired.  I'm tired of living.  Everything feels so numb and wrong.  And when I finally feel something else than that
she had no other options	her practice didn't prescribe anything narcotic	Hey guys I went to my Family doctor first and got prescribed Wellbutrin and tried it but got side effects, we switched to stratterra (god I hope I spelled that right) and had adverse side effects still.  She told me  <e1> she had no other options </e1>  because  <e2> her practice didn't prescribe anything narcotic </e2>  and told me I need to see a psychiatrist, now I'm 21 and really poor which is why I went to my family doctor but how can I go to my psychiatrist without sounding drug seeking and get prescribed to one of the other options, I'd be open to adderall vyvanse concerta and Ritalin makes me a little nervous but I'd even try that I just need the help and I need it done in one visit because again I'm broke. 
I cant take anything else	drug tests are most likely on my horizon	Long story short, was arrested the other day and caught with oxys on me.  I'm ready to quit this shit for good but just looking for some answers on withdrawal. .  I was never a serious addict (at most 45mgs a day with a day off every week or so since December) but I just have no energy/emotion.  My parents are really supportive of me and are going to help with everything.  I'm just curious whats in store? Let me start with my last dose was Tuesday around 6PM.  I know this isn't as serious as some of you guys on here but I just need a place to talk things out with ppl who can relate.  I don't have the nausea or anything yet, if that will even happen, but I just want to know when will I feel normal and what are some tips? <e1> I cant take anything else </e1>  as  <e2> drug tests are most likely on my horizon </e2>  and I'm already a serious stoner and today is day 1 of that too.  Any advice or do I need to just suck it up for a few days and I'll be good? 
So,I've	said	So,I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD and begun taking vyvanse.  I'm a hard-core introvert, and I have ADHD  (combination type) which made it very hard to diagnose me in earlier years (read: school years). Up until now, my ADHD made me brilliant and creative in ways many other people do not experience, and I've been very successful at certain points job-wise when Ive been able to pull myself together for even a month at a time. With that said
For	happiness.	For example, when there's an akward usage of words on my part or I forgot to say something, when people say something in a way that may be offensive/mean/not kind, I make a very big deal out of it (get angry at myself or others).  With other words, at those times words can really spark emotion into me. But when people compliment me or say thank me for my actions, I tend to ignore it a bit.  I don't know where to place it or what to think of it, so it kinda just flies right through me.  I think at those times they should also spark emotion: happiness. 
I	cause.	I need to say this somewhere, every birthday is another disappointment.  I'm not sure where I'm going in life, a lot of my friends are drifting away , and the woman I love doesn't want me.  My dreams of being a musician are a joke, especially with my pathetic work ethic, I don't know why I bother hoping that things will improve when I know that I won't follow through.  I hate having to act like I'm somehow glad to be a year older, and I needed somewhere to say so.  My life is pretty good thanks to my family's (read mothers) efforts , and I fucking hate most of it.  Childhood cut short by bullies, and years spent socially catching up to my peers, I graduated high school without a clue about anything.  Then bombing through college, just to graduate with a practically useless degree in the coming fall.  I see no autonomy or agency in my future, only financial limitations and shitty jobs.  Kill me now, I don't have the energy for this.  I'm a lost cause. 
I	issue.	I was diagnosed with ADHD-C a couple of weeks ago and honestly I am shocked by the stigma against people with ADHD in the US.  Almost every single person (mostly medical professionals) that I have disclosed my diagnosis to, have told me in one way or the other that they were surprised that I was not stupid.  What the hell?? I haven't told my family and friends about my diagnosis yet and sometimes I think that I shouldn't, but then again if I don't speak out then who is? I would really like to hear your experiences and how you've dealt with this issue. 
Hello	appreciated.	Hello everyone, I've been struggling with panic attacks for about 2 months now.  I can't lay down without getting the shakes or my heart starting to beat rapidly.  It's very annoying when these things happen, and Im considering towards taking medication.  My only fear about taking medication is the withdrawal symptoms.  For anyone that has taken anti anxiety medication, can you please tell me how your experience was with them.  All feedback is greatly appreciated. 
I've always felt ashamed	I couldn't stay organized or stay motivated for shit	I've always been smart.  Book-smart and good at reasoning. But  <e1> I've always felt ashamed </e1>  because  <e2> I couldn't stay organized or stay motivated for shit </e2> .  I was angry at myself that despite being perfectly capable of acing Calculus, I couldn't get myself to pay attention for any of it.  But about a week ago it suddenly dawned on me that I have ADHD.  And finally I don't hate myself. TL;DR: Realizing that I have ADHD improved my self-esteem
Hi	help.	Hi all,This is why I first suspected I might have ADHD and it continues to plague me post-diagnosis and despite treatment. Every so often I will have to perform tasks at work that involve serious attention to detail and irrevocable consequences when I mess up - Things like payments, spreadsheets, fiddly data entry in software. I often get this stuff wrong.  That wouldn't be so bad.  But what really gets to me is that I don't even notice I've messed up until it's too late.  I will be 100% certain that I nailed it, only to look back and realise I made a really critical error.  Sometimes I'll even fix it on time, triple check everything and then make a new mistake somewhere else. Luckily nobody gets hurt in my industry when there's mistakes but I am always in fear of serious repercussions.  Do you experience this as well? Any advice would really help. 
I've	goes.	I've tired quitting before, but I always knew deep down I'd be back.  Always looking forward to that next hit, that next high.  Thinking I could 'handle it' and use it 'only on the weekends' when I would buy it again.  Before you know it I'm high before work, high after work, high and hiding it from people I love.  What the hell kind of control is that? Weed was controlling me.  Changing the way I thought and reacted.  Changing my outlook on life, my outgoing personality to a hermit one.  Turning me into a blank stare stoner.  Not no more.  All the glass and even my hash is far far away.  Let my smokin friends know I will not partake and that I need to do this for me, so please don't offer any.  Remarkable how understanding and supportive they are.  Will let you know how this goes.  
Good	5'11	Good morning.  After a year on 60mg Straterra from a PCP who doesn't prescribe controlled substances, I recently had a psychiatrist switch me from 20mg Vyvanse, as I was experiencing some rather unpleasant sexual side effects from the former, along with a suspicion that I could be doing better on a stimulant based on childhood experience.  So far, there seems to be something to this.  Streterra helps me get through the day and stay positive without being bored out of my mind.  It doesn't really keep me focused or motivated.  On the other hand, I'm getting so much more done on the Vyvanse.  I feel like a part of my brain I haven't used in over a decade has been switched back on, rust and all, and that things will be great if I give it time.  But there have been issues. Two things worth noting, I'm a 5'11
if people know any ways I might be able to get this addressed without it costing a ton	no insurance	So I just moved from new York to Maine and I was taking 1mg of Klonopin once a day.  I'd been on that for about a year or so.  The past week I've cut it down to . 5mg per day.  I have about 15 1mg tablets left.  I have no insurance here yet and no way to get anymore klonopin.  Just curious  <e1> if people know any ways I might be able to get this addressed without it costing a ton </e1>  because of  <e2> no insurance </e2> .  or if it's going to be safely possible for me to work my way off it with 15 pills left taking half a day and then 1/4 a day. Thanks guys appreciate it. 
I	aids?	I knew that getting a good nights rest would be a struggle, but this is ridiculous.  My wife has been sharing her ambien with me, which helps me fall asleep, but, I don't feel the slightest bit rested when I wake up.  I've also been taking l-tryptophan so I could stop taking ambien but after tossing and turning for too long, I've eventually taken half an ambien.  It seems like everyday I wake up more tired than the last.  Has anyone else experienced this empty sleep when quitting, or is this purely from the sleep aids? 
Just	anxiety.	Just venting. . I'm so upset and angry, as well as anxious.  My bike was one of my favourite things I own and someone came into my backyard in the middle of the night and stole both of them.  I just got over feeling anxious about going into my backyard at night, now I don't feel safe at all.  Someone could just come into my yard and take my things.  They could hurt my rabbits.  I can't afford to buy a new bike and it was helping my anxiety. 
I	worse??	I have quit drinking for 3 days now after a year of heavy vodka drinking.  Some of thr things ive noticed is that at night when i lay down to sleep i get miserable.  I shake so bad and cannot fall asleep to save my life.  I have to take around 2 shots to stop the shaking so that i can sleep.  Also I've noticed is that I have no energy at all.  I feel like a turd everyday.  How long will this last and will it get worse??
This is arguably the most difficult aspect of his BPD that I have to deal with	I have never been or will ever be a yes-man	How do y'all BPDs diffuse your worst triggers?  For instance, my BPD partner's most incorrigible trigger BY FAR is situations when he is told no or doesn't get his way, something doesn't go as expected, or his routine is interrupted -- basically, any situation where he is not in control.   How in the hell does an innocent bystander loved one like myself even begin to help resolve such childish nonsense?  The amount of impulsive spite I have to deal with sometimes is insane.    <e1> This is arguably the most difficult aspect of his BPD that I have to deal with </e1>  because  <e2> I have never been or will ever be a yes-man </e2> , but I try to be as polite yet direct as possible when these random spirals blow up. . . 
Ugh.	call.	Ugh.  I don't know what to do.  I need to call a doctors office to ask a question.  The office has a machine that answers so you can leave a voicemail, but of course my social anxiety is making it impossible to do this.  I always end up sounding like a nervous stumbling fool in voicemails.  It's embarrassing. Edit: Well I wrote a brief script per everyone's advice and that helped.  Ended up sounding natural after I built up the courage to make the call. 
My	pill	My girlfriend is having flashbacks to when she was about six.  One of the recurring ones is about roses in her bedroom that smell oo sweet.  It's often paired with a memory about her mother putting a white pill in pudding and giving it to her.  (She calls it her special medicine that makes her behave. )She usually has these flashbacks when I'm trying to get her to take her medication.  I'm curious as to what her mother could have given her and whether it could have had lasting health problems. Does anyone know of a drug that's in the form of a white pill
lose my equilibrium and I get panic attacks	I think I am always about to fall	I have a fear of heights that developed to the point where if I am standing on an uneven ground, I  <e1> lose my equilibrium and I get panic attacks </e1>  because  <e2> I think I am always about to fall </e2> . So I grab on to something like a lamp post to help me ground myself.  I live somewhere there are lots of up and down hill roads that really make me feel really uncomfortable. Can anyone relate to this?
I avoid my family and friends	I don't want them to hate me as much as I already hate myself	Marijuana is a crutch that I've been leaning on nearly daily for 6 years (I'm 21).  My addiction has fucked over so many good things I had going in my life, and I'm just done now.  I ruined my grades in high school, flunked out of college, wasted a staggering portion of my income, and lost the girl I wanted to one day marry.  My addiction turned me into a shell of a person.  It's destroyed my ambitions, and made me complacent.  I've become embarrassed to be the person I am.   <e1> I avoid my family and friends  </e1> because  <e2> I don't want them to hate me as much as I already hate myself </e2> .  I feel dirty.  I'm ready to cleanse. I deleted all of my potential hook-ups from my phone, facebook, etc.  and threw all of my paraphernalia in the garbage.  Today I begin a new morning ritual.  Rather than coffee + weed, I'm going for a run with my brother. Wish me luck, boys.  I'll update and let you all know how I'm doing in a week. 
I'll feel extremely anxious	I'm not accomplishing what I should	I have mild-moderate depression and moderate-severe generalized anxiety.  They play off each other where I'll have no motivation to do anything yet  <e1> I'll feel extremely anxious </e1>  because  <e2> I'm not accomplishing what I should </e2> .  I can usually find a way to cope and move on, pretending I'm fine.  Maybe most days I am.  I'm a graduate student.  I'm expected to make progress in my research, yet lately my depression and anxiety have been rearing their ugly heads and I cannot bring myself to do anything science related (I'm a biochemist).  However, it's hard to explain to your boss why you're getting nowhere when you don't tell them you've got depression and anxiety.  Further, I think the fact that I don't fit the stereotypical depressed look makes it look like I'm just lazy.  [face]( com/a/Ir7Up)Point being
obsession with the numbers 2 and 6	causes me much distress	I don't know if this classifies as ocd or not.  I have this  <e1> obsession with the numbers 2 and 6 </e1>  and feel like they rule my life.  Whenever I have to do something as stupid as choose a number I can only choose one of those.  If I don't I get anxious as hell.  Another problem that  <e2> causes me much distress  </e2> is I can only begin stuff on dates with those numbers.  For example, whether I'm doing something trivial as beginning a game's carreer mode or life altering like choosing my wedding date I have to do it on dates with those numbers.  If I don't I get distressed and terribly anxious most of the times having to start everything over again.  I just can't bring myself to ignore the damn dates.  Is this really ocd? 
All the drinks were free	I had 3 fruity shots and 3 fruity drinks	I had happy hour last night with my job.   <e1> All the drinks were free </e1>  so  <e2> I had 3 fruity shots and 3 fruity drinks </e2> .  I got pretty drunk and everything was blurry.  I remember everything though.  The conversation I had with my co workers.  I went into the bathroom alone.  My boyfriend picked me up after an hour. My anxiety is telling me I got raped during that time but I know it's not true.  The top button of my shirt was undone but I think it's because I hugged my bf .  Allot of people from the company was there but I'm convinced someone followed me into the bathroom which is false.  One of my co workers passed me a shot I ordered and I'm just like omg what if he drugged it but I remember everything!Does anyone else experience this? Things that happen that you don't remember but you know didn't happen?
She is against me getting back on meds	no pill can make you happy	How do you deal with people basically invalidating mental illness? My cousin/best friend is just not getting my state of wellness and I'm having trouble getting her to take me seriously.   <e1> She is against me getting back on meds </e1>  because,  <e2> no pill can make you happy </e2> .   Well no shit.  I wouldn't consider meds if it wasn't necessary.   She's completely frustrated with that fact that my life is falling apart.   No job
I'm writing this	to convince myself	So, I stopped drinking in my early thirties for five years.   In retrospect, it was probably the best five years of my life.   I accomplished so much.   As you might guess, I fell off the wagon and ten years later I'm struggling - high bottom struggling.   Like every Monday I say I'm done, but on Tuesday I have another 12 pack in the fridge.   It's a stress response followed by a mild binge . . . . every single night (alone after everyone goes to bed). It's been almost a week since my last drink and it's clear my life is just so sad and stressful - like some sitcom cliche about some doofus father/husband.  I know why I drink, I just want to numb out and forget.   Of course, I won't drink this time - I've committed.  I guess that's why  <e1> I'm writing this </e1> ,  <e2> to convince myself </e2> .   I'm thankful for this group. 
I have set goals to push myself far away from my family	being with them only causes more anxiety and thus more depression	I've been working on improving myself for several months yet I'm still depressed and anxious. Depression and anxiety has plagued my family, both extended and immediate, for generations and so I am convinced the state of my mental health is brought on by genetics.  Although my dad disagrees contending everyone has personal issues we just don't see them.  Interestingly enough though poor mental health is only characteristic of his side of the family. Sidenote: It is for the above stated reason  <e1> I have set goals to push myself far away from my family </e1> .  Because in other words  <e2> being with them only causes more anxiety and thus more depression </e2> .  This makes being wth them is the opposite of fulfilling. In regards to the goals I set I fear I will not be able to accomplish them without breaking out of the grips of anxiety and depression first. My concerns
I	people.	I have problems with morality.  I have serious anxiety, and one of my problems is with morality.  I am terrified of doing something wrong, and sometimes I'm in a situation where I don't know if something is right or wrong-- and I paralyze myself out of fear of doing something wrong.  And I'm afraid I'll punish myself if I do feel guilty and that I won't be able to stop myself. How do I deal with this? How the hell do I know if something is right or wrong? My brain obviously isn't always a reliable judge, and sometimes given the situation I can't ask other people. 
You	*	You know that feeling when life is going way too fast and the little (metaphorical) demons inside start scratching on the walls? Panic about the future, present and past.  What I didn't do right, what I can't do, and what I'll probably never be able to.  It feels like time is literally sand slipping through my fingers.  Jumbled in there are people, friendships, and goals; *life* in general.  All of it falling away within seconds.  I feel like its getting harder to breathe with all the weight pushing down on me.  *I don't think I can do this. *
I've	treatment?	I've struggled with ADHD for years now without treatment.  My therapist now has prescribed me Concerta.  In school I was always an underachiever.  And outside of school I struggle to watch movies, books, tv shows, play, etc.  It was always a big effort to do/enjoy anything.  Whether in school or in my free time.  As a result, I can feel quite down about myself.  Not being smart enough, being uninteresting, etc.  But I'm hoping that will change.  How have your lives changed for the better after your ADHD diagnosis and treatment? 
She gave me a reason to live	i stopped cutting I stopped so many bad habits	We both suffered from depression all through highschool.  We had our ups and downs and I can say that she is the most beautiful girl i ever met in my life.   <e1> She gave me a reason to live </e1>  ,because of her <e2>  i stopped cutting I stopped so many bad habits </e2> .  We decided a break up would be the best option.  It was never bound to work out due to personal reasons.  I love her so much more then anything now I'm back to what I used to be before I met her.  She was the best 5 years I ever had in my life and I wish I could take back anything bad to her.  There was so much we didn't do yet.  I miss you so much.  Im happy I got to positively change someone.  I saved her life and she saved mine but now it's gone. I don't expect anyone to read this but I hope you all are doing okay.  Life is hard.  I lurked on this sub for years I never thought i would post. 
I	hope.	I don't even know what to say, but I'm glad I did it.  I almost burst out crying as I was talking - I guess I never really said everything that's wrong out loud.  It was weird to hear.  Like, wait, this is me? Really? And the accuracy of his summary at the end. . .  wow.  It described everything going through my head perfectly.  I couldn't help but laugh at how well he understood. Anyways, I have my next session on Friday.  I feel good.  I mean, I feel like shit, but I feel good as well.  Like I'm going to get better.  Somewhere, far into the future, years ahead, things are gonna be okay.  I hope. 
I took a break	it was becoming less effective and I don't like the idea of upping my dose	I recently went back on aderall after about a month break.   <e1> I took a break </e1>  because <e2>  it was becoming less effective and I don't like the idea of upping my dose </e2> . I've been back on and it's like my -break didn't change anything.  Shouldn't the effectiveness be as good as when I started?That's how it's always been when going off weed and caffeine for me.  I am on a relatively low dose (20mg xr with 5mg irs to take as needed) if that's the problem. 
I	alone.	I started a new job recently, and one of the things that really helps me is /r/anxiety and /r/socialanxiety.  Sometimes my anxiety gets so overwhelming that I feel like I'll break down at work.  But lurking through these subreddits every morning before work has been a lifesaver.  Knowing there's someone else out there struggling and trying and dealing with anxiety at that moment just like me is very calming.  We're all together in this, going through the same things.  Remember that whatever situation you're worrying about right now, where it has to do with work or relationships or whatever, someone is or has gone through the same thing, and has/is experiencing what you're feeling.  You're never alone. 
I've	eating/exercising)	I've been on a very small dose of Buspar (2. 5 mg twice a day, I'm apparently super sensitive to anti-anxiety meds) for 11 months.  Tried it after really bad (but brief) experiences with Wellbutrin and Lexapro before that.  I think the first 4-6 weeks on Buspar, I felt like it helped a lot (maybe placebo?).  But since then, things have gotten steadily worse.  I feel more agoraphobic, more panicked, sleep like crap, and have weird random low blood pressure dips.  I look back through the notes on my calendar, and honestly, I think I felt better before I attempted ANY medication at all.  Yes, I had anxiety, but I feel like if I'd known about meditation and keeping a CBT journal, I could deal.  I've also been eating much, much better than ever, and exercising (I've lost 17 lbs so far). Has anyone else had a similar experience with Buspar? Would it be crazy to talk to my doctor about coming off the medication, and just trying meditation and CBT instead? (And continuing with healthy eating/exercising)
i	it	i know i don't really want my life to end but accepting what's out of my control, especially when it comes to someone i love, is too much for me to handleeverytime i go to end it my blood runs cold and i get scared and stopi want this pain to stop so badi don't feel like i'm a worthwhile human being and the person that made me feel like i was is pushing me awayi'm too dependent.  i should create my own happinessbUT OUT OF WHAT.  I CAN'T STOP CRYING EVERY TIME I DON'T DISTRACT MYSELF.  I 'M SO STUPID AND ALL I DO IS mess everything up and cause pain for the person i love the most in the whole fucking worldi see no reason not to do it
Before	helping.	Before I know it, my confidence and self-esteem has already hit bottom.  I have no friends.  I don't have any social skill.  Whenever I try to open my mouth, it always end in a lecture and judgement from my parents. All I want is someone to listen to my troubles and pain, and give me a hug afterwards.  Is that too much to ask for?I am on anti-depressants, seroxat 12. 5mg, but they are not helping. 
On	similar.	On a daily basis (besides weekends when i don't see anyone) during school i use humour to formally express my depression to my close group of friends, who think i'm joking about everything i say, about killing myself, not having a future, being alone, not liking anyone ect. . .  After everyday i go home and feel drained like i have taken all my energy faking myself all day using humour to cover myself. and i was wandering if anyone does the same thing or anything remotely similar.   
Hello!	that	Hello! I'm 24 years old.  I've been going to CBT-therapy (think it's called that in English) for around 5 months now and have been diagnosed with severe GAD.  Which I have had for maybe 10-14 years in different variations.  I'm now meeting a doctor tomorrow for an evaluation and to see which medication would fit me the best.  I'm very anxious and afraid to get the wrong kinds of medication (if I even get some, I dunno how it works).  Is there anything I should think about going into the talks tomorrow?I'm also very worried since my mother is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  And something that is constantly in the back of my head is what if I'm schizophrenic or if something will trigger that in me.  Should I tell this to my doctor? Yes obviously I should.  But is there something I should think about? I don't really trust my doctor to make the right choice.  I'm just worried he'll sloppily choose some random med.  Don't know why he would do that
As	remember	As stated, I don't have any trouble keeping a sleep schedule.  I'm actually *very* scheduled about my sleep I fall asleep relatively easily and wake up (mostly) on-time.  Going to bed as late as midnight is very rare for me.  But I usually feel drained during the day. I talked with others who have ADD and they say that people with ADD need more sleep than non-ADD people (I've heard claims of 10 hours! o. O )I have noticed I feel more alert the more sleep I get, but then, doesn't everyone? Am I self-absorbed for feeling like I need more sleep? My eed (or is it only a desire?) for sleep does cause conflict with others in the house sometimes. I'm a bit of a type-A personality (I say a bit. . . remember
It was almost easier when I was drinking	I was consistently numbing my emotions	. . . and it's not letting up.  I started teaching high school on Wednesday and have some really terrible kids this year.  They are malicious, mean, and manipulative, and even though it's my 5th year, I am still having the most difficult time managing them.   <e1> It was almost easier when I was drinking  </e1> because <e2>  I was consistently numbing my emotions </e2> .  When I got sober, I became an emotional basket case, and I'm having a really difficult time keeping it together at certain points throughout the day.  I also quit smoking cigarettes a couple of weeks ago, so I feel like I am just completely out of vices.  I know drinking won't fix any of this, but the devil on my shoulder keeps reminding me that there is a perfect way to stop caring/feeling again, just waiting for me, any time I decide to pick it back up. . .  I don't know what I am hoping to accomplish here, but I just needed to vent.  
to	thing.	to die a hero, or to live long enough to see yourself become a monster?to end it all right now, while i'm still decent. or to live with certain reassurances, such as inescapable pain. dread, slowly dying. so many opportunities in life,so many wonderous adventures beyond death. get busy living?or get busy drowning in your own shame?being a coward is such a terrible thing. 
Background	done.	Background is I'm 26 with a 9 year old child.  I was diagnosed bipolar 2 in 2013. I've been seriously mentally ill for the past 4 years of my life, anorexia, alcoholism, depression, self harm, manic episodes, suicide attempt.  Each time I have been turned away from inpatient help (even after a massive overdose they let me go home).  Now I haven't seen my son for 2 weeks, I can't see him, I'm a mess. I need to go into inpatient, but whenever I go in for assessment they send me home, even the time I threatened my son's life at the same time as my own.  I can't be rejected from inpatient again, I will kill myself if they do it.  What do I do? Why will they never allow me to stay even though I'm completely done. 
My	=/Thoughts?	My son (9) has ADHD-C. He is very inattentive.  School is a struggle.  He is behind in every subject.  We do Adderall 10mg XR and teachers seem to see a difference, but catching up seems impossible.  He has a hard time making friends.  He is annoying.  His relationships arent appropriate (he doesnt act 'mature').   He is able to befriend many 6 and 7 year olds.  He sat on the bus with the Kindergarteners all school year.   He is involved in Scouts and the boys all seem to do things together.  I was cruising FB this evening and saw pictures posted from a birthday party of a Scout boy that he wasnt invited to.  Im heartbroken.  He doesnt know about it and thankfully didnt glance and see the pictures.  Does it get better? Are his relationships with kids ruined?Kids dont remember how smart you were or dumb you were in school - they remember your company. Im so afraid the kids dislike him already and this is how its going to be for the next 9 years.  We have no plans of moving and we live in a rural area so switching schools isnt quite an option to 'start over'.  =/Thoughts?
I realize I am very lucky	I've had almost no cravings and certainly not any that are unmanageable	It's been 45 days since I've consumed alcohol.  I've been to a wedding, on vacation and in many situations where people were drinking.  I am proud of myself and I feel strong and happy to be sober.  I don't miss drinking.  <e1>  I realize I am very lucky  </e1> because  <e2> I've had almost no cravings and certainly not any that are unmanageable </e2> .  But my struggle is with how I feel since I quit.  I exercise and sleep quite a bit but I don't have much energy.  I get really tired and depressed at times.  This weekend has been hard.  I know it's still very early in my recovery and my brain is readjusting to life without alcohol.  I am determined to keep going.  But I sure would like to feel better.  Where is the pink cloud? Anyone else have the blues during the first couple months? I am so grateful for the help and wisdom I've found here at SD.  Thank you! I will not drink with y'all today!
Would	Thoughts?	Would anyone else be interested in a weekly pinned thread like the ones I've seen in other subreddits? We could talk about what's new and what's going on in our dreamworlds or give each other feedback on coping with MD.  I think it'd be a nice thing to help build the community here, and propagate advice.  Also, I am always very excited about what is going on in my daydreams and want to share the particulars but am too embarassed to talk to people in IRL about them.  I imagine others feel the same way and this thread could be a nice place to discuss anything and everthing MD related. Thoughts?
30	complete.	30 days.  That's when she said she would be gone.  As I woke up this morning from my restless sleep all I could smell was the scent of her, left on the pillow.  As I try to just get myself together for work I feel like I'll just break down at the drop of a hat.  It doesn't help that my job revolves around pissed off customers.  I think it'll be good to get out of the house but I have no motivation for anything.  All I want to do is crawl under the covers and never wake up.  I write this all as a way for me to cope with what I'm going through.  Just as a daily reminder until the countdown is complete.  
I've	point?	I've been thinking a lot lately, and honestly I just don't see the point in going on, there are two major reasons why I'm here right now.  1) The few close friends and family I have 2) I'm scared of the pain.  But I find these things becoming less and less effective in terms of helping me get rid of suicidal thoughts.  I'm just getting tired of the everyday, same bullshit different day routine.  I'm tired of being tired.  I'm an Atheist, I'm queer as a 3$  bill and I just don't know what to do anymore, Most of my family doesn't give a shit, I've lost a majority of my friends within the last few months.  So I'll ask the Internet.  What's the point? 
Is	world?	Is it still a watch if it's planned. . .  to be executed in 10-15 years?I'm so tired of life.  All my time is spent trying to recapture those happy moments in the past.  I just don't feel that happiness anymore -even going through the same motions. My family is poor and I'm the only one making money so it's financially irresponsible to die right now. . .  I thought about life insurance but they usually have clauses. . .  but I finally realized that even if I commit suicide, my family can still inherit my 401k.  It'll take a few more years but it might just be the kickstart they need. Anyways, why does it always have to be about the sadness people left behind feel? Why can't people just understand that some people don't want this world?
The enormous elephant that's in the room and still ignore it	you are there	That feeling you get when you've done something wrong.  All eyes are somehow drawn to your attention.   <e1> The enormous elephant that's in the room and still ignore it </e1>  because  <e2> you are there </e2> .  That's how I felt yesterday at work.  The hours dragged on but knowing that I was one call away from just breaking down mentally I made the excuse to go.  Even though work felt eternal, it was a cakewalk compared to being at home.  At least here I could shut off from the world and go unnoticed once again.  When I awoke this morning from a my restless sleep we crossed paths in the living room.  I opened my arms to her and she embraced me.  I was holding her for the short time that it was.  This touch I've been longing for, knowing what healing properties it has or just to make me feel that I'm all right.  That's when I hear her starting to cry.  I feel terrible once again, seeing as this interaction had the bizzaro effect on her.  Brings me nothing but sadness.  
I	back	I was walking my dog down to a park at the end of our street and some women were there with three dogs that were off leash (which is, ya know, great) and one dog charged and attacked my dog.  I checked my dog and there were no punctures or anything, but I am feeling so sick to my stomach now.  I keep feeling like I didn't do enough, I don't know what to do. . . do I report it? If I report it will their dog be put down? I don't want that. . . . the people are at fault.  My biggest anxiety thing right now is like, what if my dog bit the other dog in self defense and the other people try to be like oooh your dog attacked ours and then bad things happen? I just keep seeing my dog on her back
Usually I know what I'm anxious about	I am able to ignore it	When I have random anxiety, I get a bubble in the base of my throat.   <e1> Usually I know what I'm anxious about  </e1> though, so  <e2> I am able to ignore it </e2> .  However, sometimes this leads to a panic attack if it randomly occurs because I think there is something wrong with me and I convince myself I have other symptoms of a heart attack or something.  Does anyone else convince themselves they're having a heart attack and panic and what do you do about it? I've found holding Ice to my neck and wrist helps a little but I feel off for like the next day. 
I saw my Nmom a week ago	I had to get some paperwork and crap from her	 <e1> I saw my Nmom a week ago </e1>  because <e2>  I had to get some paperwork and crap from her </e2> .  Somehow we ended up getting in a conversation on empathy and feelings.  My mom CONSTANTLY accuses me of being incapable to feel remorse, guilt, emotions, or empathy.  She's been telling me I'm a sociopath since I was like 10.  While I admit I have a bit of a difficult time feeling remorse, guilt, and empathy, they also aren't foreign concepts to me and I can definitely feel them.  It's just hard for me to.  Anyway, she started getting pissy with me for no reason during this conversation (She literally always starts acting like an ass whenever she can feel the conversation heading towards something she doesn't want to talk about) and I flat out asked her if she's even capable of feeling empathy.  Her reply was literally I used to but not anymore
When	help!	When I'm walking alone, lately, anxiety hits hard and i get all dizzy sweaty, shaky and my vision goes blurry and my muscles (especially facial muscles) twitch; i keep talking to myself trying to calm myself down so that i wouldnt faint in the middle of the street but it's hopeless.  It suddenly happens and I dont know how to control it and let it subside.  so any tips would be of GREAT help!
I	:)	I traveled to an international academic conference by myself.  I'm pretty well-traveled, but being all alone in a professional social setting and leaving the comfort and safety of my home resulted in a panic attack on the 11-hour flight over.  I worked through it, forced myself to sleep instead of throwing up, and survived.  Yesterday I mustered all the courage I had and started a conversation with another girl at the conference who appeared to be all alone.  That one girl turned into four other nervous solo travelers from all over, and now we've attended conference talks and dinners together as new friends.  Sure, we'll only see each other literally once a year at the conference, but that makes a world of difference.  Here's to surviving.  Edit: Thanks, guys! :)
Anyone	Thanks	Anyone out there struggling with depression and severe anxiety and been prescribed this? Going through some things and my anxiety has gotten the best of me, especially since I now have to wait two weeks to see a specialist.  Doc just prescribed this to me to get me through but I was reading side effects and some including anxiety and depression are already symptoms I have.  What's your experience? I know everyone is different in just really nervous to take as I've never taken anything before for anxiety or depression.  Thanks
I'm	that	I'm trying to start a relationship with a new guy and I tried to kind of hint at my emotional issues by telling him that I'm insecure and perpetually nervous.  He's the epitome of zen, said it didn't bother him, and just makes every effort to make me feel loved. I want to trust that he'll be accepting of me in all of my mess, but I'm scared that once he finds out just how far gone I am he'll decide I'm oo crazy and that we won't work out. On top of that
The	fixes?	The last few days I have been extremely anxious, and in turn is making me think of every food as unappetizing, things I would normally enjoy I cannot manage more than a few bites, I took my girlfriend out for ice cream and couldn't eat more than 1/4 of a kiddie cup.  The problem is though, I am starving, I feel faint, my stomach keeps growling and my body has so much nervous energy which I know only happens to me at this level when I need food.  does anyone have any quick fixes?
Hi	good?	Hi everyone, happy weekend!I've been thinking a lot about this lately - the masks I wore and the masks I still wear today.   As a child, I learned to wear the Mask that best suited the situation, or what my parents wanted/expected.   In high school and college, I wore whatever mask I wanted to mimic in order to fit in at that moment - the Smile Mask, the Pretty Mask, the Cool Girl Mask, the Girl Who Puts Out Mask, the Smarty Pants Mask. . . . . . repeat ad nauseum.  Then my drinking escalated.   My masks got sadder.  My masks were mainly Denial Mask and Desperate Mask.   Today, I am sober and free and full of clarity, perspective, and gratitude.   The only mask I try to wear today is my mask of authenticity - my Truth Mask.   I try to live each day walking in my truth, and showing the world my good heart through my respect and love to all other people, places, and things. What about you all?  What masks are you wearing today? What masks are hung up in your closet, or gone for good?  
Sometimes	awake.	Sometimes my brain is like a pinball in a pinball machine, I can't always control where it goes but I know at the end of the day it comes back down to reset another game of random pinball tomorrow.  Sometimes I feel like I am bipolar, my mood changes as quickly as I can clap my hands.  Sometimes I want to check myself into a facility that can help me turn my brain off for an hour at most, maybe then I could relax. I just want to relax while I'm awake. 
I	this?	I just wanted to see if this is a common experience.  I find that the less sleep I get, the worse all my symptoms become.  Now this is not a surprise at all with inattention and motivation symptoms.  But it does surprise me that I get more hyper instead of more lethargic when I lack sleep.  After a couple days of 4 or less hours sleep I'm usually fidgeting like crazy, my speech speeds up and I really don't want to sit still.  I do eventually crash and the fatigue hits me all at once, but until that point I feel wired.  And I'm not currently medicated and I don't do caffeine so it isn't that.   The only theory I've heard is that you're running on adrenaline when not getting enough sleep, but I have no idea if that is true.  Is it a normal ADHD thing to experience this? 
I	today!	I don't feel like I have any new revelations other than what tons of others share on here.  My anxiety is much lower.  I feel more present.  I have been crying a lot, but it has felt really good, like I'm working through some shit I've been avoiding.  I haven't craved a drink at all, but I have felt nervous about going against the grain of society.  Reading This Naked Mind is helping with that.  I feel like a warrior.  I'm losing weight.  I'm calmer.  I'm more excited about my future.  I'm rambling.  Thank you for your support and for sharing your stories and experiences! Every single post is enlightening in its own way.  Share share share more.  I will not drink with all of you today!
Sometimes I think I hesitate from opportunities of success	I don't like the ups and downs of life	 <e1> Sometimes I think I hesitate from opportunities of success </e1>  because  <e2> I don't like the ups and downs of life </e2> .  I don't like change, few people do, but I'm especially overwhelmed whenever circumstances around my daily routines change too much and I wouldn't want to get a ton of friends only to start worry if I will ever be able to sustain them. I just don't want more pain.  I know it's a positive outlook to have to see failure and trial and error as constructive but failure can sometimes put me in a state much, much worse than I was in previously.  For example, when a classmate got made at me in college and said dude
Wow,	head	Wow, I've always loved Fergie.  But I was just listening to Big Girls Don't Cry &amp; I just heard part of the lyrics that I've heard hundreds of times, clearer then I ever have. Fairytales don't always have a happy ending do they?And I foresee the dark ahead if I staySo relevant to my situation.  The fairytales being in my head
I've never really cared about birthdays before, other than being a child,	I never really felt special at all during my life	Well, it's official, I'm now another year older.   <e1> I've never really cared about birthdays before, other than being a child, </e1>  because <e2>  I never really felt special at all during my life </e2> .  It's always been just another day.  But there was always someone to fuss over me, whether it be my mom, or a girlfriend, or whatever.  This year, I'm alone.  I'm scared.  I'm honestly terrified to be alone with myself.  I've suffered with anxiety for years, but depression is something new for me.  I've moved cross country and I've made a grand total of zero friends since I've arrived.  I'm right now sitting in my quiet lonely apartment shaking and crying, with this burning pain of agony in my heart.  How do people love or function like this? I'm just looking for maybe some advice or kind words to help me get through today.  To help me get through the next hour if need be.  Thank you.  
I	career.	I have OCD and generalized anxiety.  Almost 100% of the time my focus is on what I'm doing, what I said, how I'm looking at people, whether they are bored with what I'm saying, etc etc etc etc.  How can I stop? How can I relax? Btw: my ocd has go like 98% better since zoloft.  To give u an idea of how bad it and my anxiety was my college counselor said it was the worst shes seen in her career. 
I wanna end it, I just can't	I don't want my family to suffer because of me	My life objectively sucks.  <e1>  I wanna end it, I just can't </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want my family to suffer because of me </e2> .  I can't find happiness, Ive been through a lot and to get over these things Ill have to get through a lot again. . . I just don't have the power and Im too scared, and I wanna end it.  Im not afraid of the fact that Ill never get my conscience back, or the pain.  Im afraid that I might cause a heart atack when Ill be discovered dead.  
I can't calm downi want to die so badly i cant see the screen well	i can't stop crying	 <e1> I can't calm downi want to die so badly i cant see the screen well </e1>  because <e2>  i can't stop crying </e2> .    I am a burden to my family and I can't get anyone to understand why i feel this way.   Im trying to get onto an online crisis chat but I can't even get that to work which i thin kmeans i should really killmyself asap.   please can someon just talk to me i just need someone to tell me i'm nota horrible person
Ex-coworkers	ago)	Ex-coworkers and peers mourn my attacker constantly.  Always speaking of his goodness and how sad it is he is gone.  He tried to murder me.  He almost was successful.  No one gives a shit about what he did to me.  About how I am holding up.  No one cares.  I haven't been asked how are you by any of my old peers in over a year.  (it happened 2 years ago)
Planning	motion.	Planning a trip for my 40th birthday has me giddy.   I think setting goals and looking forward to something is so important and fun!  It's the hard work and reward thing that makes the world go round (or my world at least).   So yeah, I am looking forward to skiing with the family and yeah, I feel a little anxious about not being able to have some beers on the mountain but if I were still drinking, this trip wouldn't even be in motion.  
I	bills	I was diagnosed with bp about 5 years ago.  i got put on a weird combination of xanax and geodon which destroyed me and ended with this weird manic episode where i was cycling between believing i was dead and thinking i was basically jesus.  wound up in ER psych ward where psychiartist informed me that that drug combination was no good especially for bp, got put on rispedal and depakote under the condition that i come back in to basically be re-diagnosed as er doctor didn't think bipolar disorder was the issue. i wound up taking the new drugs for a couple weeks before stopping cold turkey.  i spent years think i was BP, trying to work around it but then life got better and the depression kind of went away, but the mania is still there.  I can't get my shit together right now i have a pile of bills
So	scary	So I've been in therapy, meds, emdr, the whole 9 yards.  I thought I was doing good, or at least having a few good weeks.   I took myself out of working as a first responder and into asset protection for a retailer who employs mostly college students.   These people do not understand ptsd one bit.   When they see an ambulance, they try to assume what it's there for and gather around while I try to close my eyes and escape the flashbacks.  Today the building shook from a low flying helicopter.    They said it was Life star for an accident.   I suffered all day while they were excited to see it.  Then I thought I did good of getting myself back together and then on my way home the seizures started again, this time taking me off the road while I was driving.  I don't even know how to explain the seizures, it's like narcolepsy but everytime I mention it to a doctor they just say sounds scary
I	oblivious.	I have almost no pictures from when I was growing up and until recently really didn't want any either.  Too many bad memories of growing up with an nMom and a very abusivd nDad.  But, now that I have 2 small children, I thought it might be good to have at least a few photos of family for them to see.  I have an app to scan pics so I don't even need to keep the actual photo albums and that's the only reason nmom agreed to bring me some.  I don't go to their house, I'm no contact with ndad.  Today she brought over a small stack of albums to start and then started gushing about all the great memories held inside.  How happy we all were back then.   They may be happy to her, but I have nothing but bad memories from my childhood.  And she's completely oblivious.  
I find at nights I just can't sleep	I'm equal parts depressed and anxious	I'm so tired, I don't even know where to start.  I feel so overwhelmed with everything on my plate and so painfully alone.  In short, in the space of 3 months all aspects of my life have really taken a turn for the worst.  Love, work, friends, health.  My self-esteem has really taken a beating.  I've been doing my best to get it together but the last couple of days especially have been just miserable. I've tried to reach out to friends and family but everyone seems to have their own things going on.  I feel really worthless, unloved and am really questioning my direction. I'd be so grateful if anyone was happy to chat for a bit or send a message through.  Anything to make me feel less disconnected and alone.  <e1> I find at nights I just can't sleep </e1>  because  <e2> I'm equal parts depressed and anxious </e2> . 
Living	old	Living life in near total isolation, except occasional work (online based).  Partner is decades older (not a rich dude), I'm a rophy but in low income situation that is basically couchsurfing.  Don't feel love for him after years of being yelled at &amp; forced to live senior's lifestyle (to avoid homelessness).   Serious depression &amp; seeing psychologist 1x month at hospital.  45 years old
So	.	So I'm 23 years old and newly diagnosed- from my memories of childhood it should have happened long ago, but thats a different story.  I started taking Vyvanse back in April.  20mg for the first month and after a month increased my doseage to 30mg.  Now everything has been alright up until about the last month or so- works been stressful lately I'll admit but I feel that I have been unusually irritable, more likely to cry, and more all around anxious about meeting my dealines at work- which just makes me feel like Im spinning in circles.  Now I dont know whether to attribute this to the meds or stress from work.  I have an appointment with my doc next month and will bring it up then.  But until then I was curious to see if anyone got this reaction from Vyvanse and prefers Aderall or any other medication over Vyvanse for this reason? From everything I could google I can mostly only find instances of people switching from adderall to vyvanse for this. . 
FINALLY	up	FINALLY I have found my people! I love you all! So can I talk with someone about how in preparation for literally any interaction including like buying food or checking out in a grocery store I have to run through every possible scenario and even if I know exactly what will happen I must continue to repeat that scenario to make sure I don't get distracted or fuck it up
I'm asking	I'm trying to find out if anyone experiences things in a similar way to me	 <e1> I'm asking  </e1> because <e2>  I'm trying to find out if anyone experiences things in a similar way to me </e2> , and I'm also curious as to how others experience anxiety.   I don't suffer from anxiety every day but when I do have it, here is what happens: one day I will wake up with bad anxiety that does not go away unless I cry it out or take clonazepam.  Then for at least 4 days afterwards I feel equally bad depression.  The depression slowly day by day gets better until I feel normal again.  Sometimes there's tiny bouts of anxiety in there.  The only thing that makes any of this bearable to me is the knowledge that odds are I will feel better again after a week or so.  Does anyone else feel just completely drained of neuro chemicals for a few days after an anxiety attack?
I have a lot going on and breathing techniques aren't helping me lower my stress or anxiety and I am in tears majority of a day	I'm losing sleep	Hey just wondering if anybody knows ways to get out of their mind.   <e1> I have a lot going on and breathing techniques aren't helping me lower my stress or anxiety and I am in tears majority of a day </e1>  (especially at night) and I'm just getting drained since  <e2> I'm losing sleep </e2>  due to this aswell.  I don't know what else to do so if anyone has any help please let me know.  Thanks.  
I'm	others?	I'm curious, as I've been taking prescribed Xanax and taking it when things flare up, if my experiences with it are the norm or not. I find that when I take it, usually when chest pains are coming frequently or something else is going on.  IE the beginning of anxiety symptoms and I know I need to be at an important meeting, visiting with friends, etc.  I sometimes get slightly drowsy for a short period of time after taking it.  Then I usually start feeling a little better in the first couple hours.  Usually I still have some lingering anxiety symptoms but they either don't get worse or they get a bit better.  Occasionally they go away completely. Is that roughly normal? Or should it be getting rid of the symptoms more completely? Sometimes it does, generally it just seems to knock things down a peg or two. I've also noticed after the initial groggy feeling, I generally go back to feeling normal with anxiety or rarely normal without anxiety.  Is that on par with what happens to others?
TL;DR	me	TL;DR @ bottomI have been using BTH (IV) since 2010 and had only started taking quitting seriously last year.  I've been to detox 3 times in the last &gt;12 months and each time I struggled to stay clean afterwards.  I'd only get a week or so under my belt before falling to the temptations that surrounded me at every turn. So, after five failed attempts at detox/rehab, I looked into other ways that would help me quit using.  I couldn't just cold turkey it.  That requires serious mental discipline that, quite frankly, I don't feel I possess.  Detox and rehab were just full of potential jougs/dealers and I'm a firm believer in the credo if nothing changes then nothing changes.  Why would I waste my time and taxpayers money (thanks Obamacare) on something that has failed me
I think she uses my dog as emotional leverage over me	he's the only thing I care about or have an attachment to that she has regular access to	Not sure how odd this is, but my NMom basks in the accomplishments of my dog (and they are dog accomplishments, like playing with a toy or running around, he can't talk or do math or anything remarkable) while downplaying my own accomplishments, remaining totally disinterested non-reactive to them, or sourly staring at me when they come up (ie: happy seeing a new girl, succeeding in school etc. ). Has anyone else ever experienced this? I find it so bizarre, but with the number things I've already seen in this sub that I used to think were only something I'd experienced, I felt it was a good question to ask you folks. FWIW, <e1>  I think she uses my dog as emotional leverage over me </e1>  because <e2>  he's the only thing I care about or have an attachment to that she has regular access to </e2> .  Perhaps there's some crossover in that and the GC angle I'm curious about?
It helps me	it allows full expression of ideas, while forcing them to slow down just long enough for me to process them rationally.	This isn't necessarily a tip that will help productivity, but I treat my commute as a time to let my brain do whatever it wants, and observe it.  When my thoughts in my head (not spoken aloud), they're much more abstract and tend to be expressed in the form of emotion rather than linear thinking.  When I speak everything out loud, I'm aware of everything I'm thinking, instead of just feeling emotionally overwhelmed.    <e1> It helps me  </e1>  because  <e2> it allows full expression of ideas, while forcing them to slow down just long enough for me to process them rationally.  </e2>  Does anyone else do this?
So	Thanks.	So I'm struggling with depression, and it's bad this time.  This is one of the longest down periods I've ever had.  Been feeling like this for around 4 months now. I know it gets better and it will at some point but right now I can't cope.  I have no job, no real solid income, I live at home with my parents, all my friends are miles away and my boyfriend broke up with me and I can't stop crying or get out of bed.  I know it's affecting my mum, I can see it in her eyes, she can't cope with me being so low. I just feel a bit at a loss at the moment.  Any help would be amazing or just someone acknowledging that I'm not crazy and my life seems a bit shit.  Like I know it will get better but right now it's hard to see the light and not feel sad all the time. Thanks. 
I'm	now	I'm not depressed but I've thinking a lot lately about this question.  My cousin has had depression for many years now.  She's medicated but very overwhelmed by stress and says thinks like I wish I could just stop existing.  I've asked her if she'd ever seriously considered suicide and she said she wants to die by suicide.  Not right now
I wouldn't hurt anyone	the violence is only ever directed at myself	What do I do? I used to be able to bottle it up but now whenever I get overwhelmed I almost explode.  I want to let it out but all I ever do is break things.  <e1>  I wouldn't hurt anyone </e1>  because  <e2> the violence is only ever directed at myself </e2>  but it's getting so much more difficult to hold back these urges.  I'm supposed to be asleep since it's 3am &amp; i have school tomorrow but I'm struggling not to smack my head repeatedly at the wall until I pass out right now. 
Hey	myself?	Hey I'm 25 female living in Canada and suffering from high levels of anxiety.  I have bipolar disorder as well.  I'm not able to do basic things like get a job and many days I'm too afraid to leave the house.  When I get really anxious I start thinking I'm God, and that's happening now.  I was thinking of admitting myself to the hospital but I'm scared they'll think my issues aren't big enough to warrant a hospital visit.  I know if I was at risk of hurting myself or others I could admit myself, but I don't think that's the case here.  Does anyone know if I can admit myself to the hospital based on what I'm feeling now?TL;DR: Can I admit myself to the psych ward for high levels of anxiety and thinking I'm God or do I have to be a danger to myself?
A	jabs	A quote from my dad, from about 20 minutes ago.  I was grey rocking through conversations about college with my parents (thank you btw, RBN) and he said it, in an accusative tone, quite randomly.  Of course, I know, at this point, that this is just an attempt to bait me into further conversation.  Fortunately, I am way too exhausted from school to give him that response he wanted.  Didn't stop him from trying again, though.  Periodically, he'd attempt to stir me once more, quite uncalled for in completely unrelated conversations.  I suppose in context of the conversations they were meant to be playful jabs
I've	experience.	I've heard that some people believe CPTSD and BPD are the same thing.  I haven't researched that much so I can't comment on that.     The symptoms are **almost** identical but I do think there are important differences.   I've never fit the stereotype of BPD (I know not everyone does) but I embraced the DX for a long time.   Its just not sitting right with me lately however.  Once I actually looked into it, CPTSD fits better than BPD comorbid with PTSD.   I wish it was recognized by the DSM.   Just curious about others opinions and experience. 
I'm sharing this	I know everyone has that one thing that just sets them off	At first it was annoyance, then worry, then anger then sadness.  My mom and I tore the house apart, walked the yard, checked my car.  Over and over and over.  I Stated yelling about how this was bull shit, completely insane.  It was a flood of emotions.  None of them good. After an hour of me just being utterly ridiculous we found them. . . . . in my fucking ignition.  Right where she said they were. I don't normally get this worked up, but when I do, its really not cool.  I hate loosing control of my emotions.  And once you calm down, It's very embarrassing, and something I could learn to do without. The only reason  <e1> I'm sharing this  </e1> is because  <e2> I know everyone has that one thing that just sets them off </e2> . If you'd like to share your experiences and what you do to cope with wanting to scream and act a fool over stupid shit like this, I would love to hear it. 
After a while, I would go back	I don't want to be around them or anyone anymore	Title kind of says it.  But my question is why and how do I over come it? In detail would be that I can't seem to do anything at all without feeling like I wanna stop.  Like I can't study, I can't take pictures anymore, I can't do my favourite game, I can't play my games.  I will just feel bored and like, lifeless after a while.  Hanging out with my friends even.   <e1> After a while, I would go back  </e1> because <e2>  I don't want to be around them or anyone anymore </e2> .  What should I do? And is it normal for things like this to happen? 
I	relaxing!	I have no idea if this has been said a million times, but you know how youre always trying to find the right sing to help you focus or unwind, but you dont even really wanna hear a song at all. Try white noise!Ive always bashed it, but put it on yesterday when i was overwhelmed by starting uni.  So fucking relaxing!
I	Opinions?	I am 6 weeks post partum and was diagnosed with OCD a week ago.  I was having harm OCD and am not now.  The other night my boyfriend was showing me a video in fb of a 14 year old trans girl and ever since I have been questioning myself and it is giving me really bad andiety.  I have always loved being s girl and NEVER questioned it.  All of my friends are girls, I've always pictured myself being a wife and mother.  And now this is making it hard to do so.  It's even making me feel like I'm drifting away from my boyfriend bc it's all I can think of.  I just want to be the happy me I was before any of this:( I feel like I don't even know myself anymore and I will be devastated if this isn't just my OCD.  It can seem so real and as if it's what I want but then I'm happy with my life as a woman and want to stay this way just scared im in denial that I would be happier as a man. . .  Opinions?
SuicideWatch/comments/4rmqa9/end_of_the_roadI	soon.	SuicideWatch/comments/4rmqa9/end_of_the_roadI just wanted to let everyone know I tried I really did but today's my last day.   I um just wanted to thank you guys for trying to encourage me but it would have never worked out.  It's nobody's fault it's what I decided to do.  Thank you all so much again.  I am scared of dying but I'm happy to know it's over soon.  
was	she?'	was driving nmom to an appointment and when i didn't do things as she wanted the moment she wanted (she wanted me to drop her off in a dangerous place, I wanted to U-turn so it would be safe) she shouted, turned off the car on me, and told me to get off.  I got scared and literally sprinted away.  I sadly didn't get too far, she found me a couple blocks away before I could make it to the subway.  After more abuse I was able to get to my brother's home.  Going to run away to his house asap then maybe find a place of my own, not sure how well things are going to turn out.  Man, I really need to get my phone back. edit: should prob also metion that she told my dad i tried to 'run away from her' he tried to scold me about 'why i got out of the car like that'.  Need less to say, he was shocked when i said 'she told me to, bet she forgot to tell you that, didn't she?'
Hi.	home?	Hi.  I am (or used to be, actually) a teacher, but i'm in a pretty bad spot right now.  My anxiety grew out of control over this year and I'm not working anymore, also there is no way for me to go back teaching right now.  My bank account is in a critical stat and I'm looking for a home office job.  Living in Brazil I don't have to make much to cover my expenses but also limits me from a lot of opportunities.  Ideally I'm lookign for something around one thousand USD /month working full time, but righ now I will take less than that.  I have very solid scientific, mathematical and logical training.  I've been studing programming and data analysis for some time now but I don't think I'm ready to work with it yet, neither have a portifolio to show. So, any suggestion for a somewhat qualified foreign worker in need to work at home?
Feeling	:)	Feeling pretty darn proud of myself, I must say. A few panic attacks, some weird out of body experiences, lethargy and brain fog.  A fair amount of chocolate.  Deep sleep (which is unusual, I usually can't sleep at all without drinking) lots of cups of tea, some action plans for triggering times/people/places/activities. I guess all that time lurking here, I picked up a few useful tools which I will use and add to over time. And mostly coming here, reading, reading, reading, posting, replying to messages (many times throughout the days). I want to thank everyone here, I could not have got this far without you. I think it might be as much as 3 years since I last went a week without drinking.  I feel like I could get used to this :)
Id get so drunk Id stick my fingers down my throat and force myself to vomit	I just had to get the poison out of my body	He was so embarrassed.  he was fine afterwards and I told him about all the times I had blacked out and woke up the next day and found Id vomited in  the sink.  Or  <e1> Id get so drunk Id stick my fingers down my throat and force myself to vomit  </e1> because <e2>  I just had to get the poison out of my body </e2> . I haven't vomited in over 18 months.   Im kind of glad I witnessed that tonight.  It was a potent reminder of the dark place i used to be in.  Fuck alcohol. 
Been	happiness)	Been thinking about quitting for a while now, but always found an excuse.  After hearing the news I started an aggressive taper and immediately cut to less than half what I was taking (I'm at the lowest since I started) the first night, sleep wasn't great, but not terrible.  Second night great sleep, and didn't wake up in withdrawal ( like I have most days in the previous months) I had a great workout today ( feel like My strength is up, I've actually for a while felt kratom detracted from top end strength) looking forward to not depending on something to function, and not having to adjust my schedule to get my dose in.  I have been reading about people getting their emotions back and I do feel they have been blunted on kratom.  I think we will all be very happy once we get back to ourselves.  Let's all stay positive and optimistic.  Just find a goal and attack it ( that's the key to true happiness) 
NSIL	Thoughts?	NSIL started calling a week ago, once or twice a day.  We don't pick up.  Again we have blocked her 'new' number.  She starts with emails, new address.   We blocked her last email address.   Anyway. . .  NSIL says she is coming to our house - 4 states away from her next week to 'talk' we ignore her.   She keeps sending emails we don't read.   We opened one the other day as it said she was coming.   We said please don't come, we don't want a relationship with you and NMIL who isn't as bad but the web of crazy they live in is too much.   She emails back, coming anyway, we respond please don't.  Will ask you to leave and if you don't will call police.    No response yet.   Spouse thinks he should go to sour atty to send her a letter from attorney saying they don't want to know you - go away.   I am concerned that will make it worse?  Thoughts?
Anyone	right?	Anyone else feel this way? Like it's strangely cathartic at times focusing on all my faults. . .  Just really letting those negative thoughts go wild and being completely overly critical of myself.  It can't be healthy but I find myself doing it more and more frequently.  Maybe it's a coping mechanism? Like if it's something inherently wrong with me then it's ok that I'll never change.  I just can't help it.  It's just in my nature, right? 
I tried using marijuana and also alcohol	it really just made me even more depressed and anxious	Coming off of a 9-month habbit of ~21-30g a day, every day(that is roughly 10-15gs each dose, twice a day).  I tapered down for the first three days, but completely went without two days ago.  First day was complete hell.  First half of the second day was pretty bad too.   <e1> I tried using marijuana and also alcohol </e1> , and <e2>  it really just made me even more depressed and anxious </e2> , so I'd advise against using those during the Acute WD's.  One thing I've found that actually helps a little bit is some kava.  Don't overdue it, a little bit every now and then to ease the anxiety is all you need.  Also Imodium for the volcano lava shits.  I was finally able to start laughing again last night, and today I was able to have some fun with my brother.  Things are starting to look up. 
so	way?Thanks.	so sometimes i have friends who come over to spend the day at my house.  its fun and everything and I'm always in a good mood at that time.  but then there is this particular friend who comes over and she most of the time she ends up spending the night and half of the next day with us.  at that point i start to get irritated and i really just want her to go away.  but obviously i cant kick her out.  i go into a bad mood afterwards and i don't want to interact with her so i let my sister occupy her.  i know its rude but i feel like my privacy has been invaded and i really just want to be left alone. i should also mention that i can only socialise with people for so long.  i feel so drained afterwards and i get cranky if anyone intrudes. what should i do? does anyone else have this problem? Am i an asshole for thinking this way?Thanks. 
I was *really* craving a cigarette	I took some Bupropion	This morning when I woke up and took my usual 20mg adderall pill, along with my other meds.  Then, since  <e1> I was *really* craving a cigarette </e1>   <e2> I took some Bupropion </e2> , or I thought I did.  I'm pretty sure it was acctually one of my old adderall tablets that had a way higher dose, like 60mg.  That was like 15 hours ago and my pulse is still elevated and I can't sleep.  I cleaned the everloving fuck out of everything ever and I'm pretty sure I freaked my roommate out.  My heart was racing and so we're my thoughts, and I didn't eat anything until like 800.  It's one of the worse feelings I've had in a long time.  I flushed the rest of the 60's.  There's no way in hell I'm ever making that mistake again.  I don't understand why/how people do this for fun, it wasn't.  At all.  TL;DR: Accidentally took basically a quadruple dose of adderall.  It sucked. 
She	?	She does not even have basic habits -like brushing teeth when she wakes up.  The sad part is neither do I.  I do however have an issue with needing showers to wake up/warm up, which is when my tooth brushing gets done. Anyway- the issue is what are the things a child needs to know before they are an adult ? Basic things. . . . complex things. These ideas for teaching here things that she needs to known, does not come automatically to me.  I need a checklist of what to teach her.  She is 81.  brushing teeth2.  cutting nails3.  combing hair4.  showering5.  doing laundry (seperate steps)6.  doing dishes (I need a refresher on this - if someone can break it out )7.  trimming nails8.  looking at watch to check time before 9.  going to the bathroom when its time or regularlyI will likely end up with 1000s of items on that list.  That is way better than what I have now- an empty mind.  Edit: is there some list of skills they need by age - that you all would not mind sharing ?
youtube.	all	 youtube. com/watch?v=ykvC3QXJb18# t=0. 82605Obviously the title of the video caught my eye.  And he even called me out in the video, I was angry and I was planning on leaving a nasty comment saying he didn't know me.  Saying he doesn't understand the imbalance of chemicals in my brain.  My doctors said I'm depressed and I'm struggling so how dare he? But that wasn't what he's saying.  He's saying my name isn't Depression.  My name is Dillon.  I've always said I'm depressed and I use my diagnosis and my meds to make it make sense in my head.  I always get pissed off when someone tells me it's in my head or I just need to think better or even the back handed I hope you feel better.  And I don't think they're made maliciously at all
I still dropped out, and also had to quit work	the level of anxiety and the number of panic attacks I was having	A phobia of study is the weirdest sounding thing ever.  Basically even talking about going back to uni or any sort of study makes me feel anxious and brings me to tears.  Last time I tried study (it was visual arts, so not anything difficult) I ended up medicated for anxiety (SSRI and xanax), <e1>  I still dropped out, and also had to quit work  </e1> due to  <e2> the level of anxiety and the number of panic attacks I was having </e2> .  This was over 5 years ago and I haven't had any issues with anxiety since, I was only on the medication for about a year, maybe a little less.  If I avoid study my general anxiety is fairly low level, I haven't had a single panic attack in about 5 years.  Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Have you overcome it? Any advice?I'm only recently diagnosed, but I am desperate to go to university and start a career.  
Hi,	this.	Hi, I wasn't sure where to post this as I've never really talked openly about it before.  To start, I'm 21 and deal with Anxiety, Depression and Asperger's Syndrome.  Over the last year I've been trying to deal with nocturnal panic attacks.  I'm actually posting this after having one about an hour ago, and decided to try reddit for help.  For anybody who doesn't know what a nocturnal panic attack is, this page explains it better than I can:  mayoclinic. org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/expert-answers/panic-attacks/faq-20057984I was wondering, does anybody else experience this and how do you deal with it.  I'm desperate at this point. A little more information: I was on fluoxetine and it stopped helping, my dosage was upped and still nothing and so I took myself of the drug (stupid I know).  I will likely be seeing my doctor again sometime soon to go over some options. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
I can say that there is a gap	whenever I talk with my relatives I cannot maintain a long conversation anymore, and eye contact is less frequent	Past experiences like not reaching out to my cousins, uncles and aunts though I am near their place, so it created a gap between us.  <e1>  I can say that there is a gap  </e1> because <e2>  whenever I talk with my relatives I cannot maintain a long conversation anymore, and eye contact is less frequent </e2> .  Also, I am a shy type and passive guy.  I don't talk too much and I myself cant look straight to the eyes to the one I talk to.  Also my past experience is that I cannot even say 'hi' to the persons that I know before, so now they don't do the same to me. 
I try to live as alone as possible away from people in my class.  I like it that way	my anxiety disorder	Every single day I get up, I go to school, I don't smile, I don't talk, I don't socialise.   <e1> I try to live as alone as possible away from people in my class.  I like it that way  </e1> because of <e2>  my anxiety disorder </e2> .  I cut myself on my thighs so that no one will ever realise, yet I get told, You're doing it for the attention like being sad is an option to them.  Like there is a button that I can press that will make me happy.  People don't understand why I act like this
I'm	better.	I'm an idiot.  I've been off my meds, and it has fucked me over in the worst way ever. Let me list off a list of the things I was convinced I was dying of over the past month:RabiesWorried about going to sleep thinking I would go into a diabetic coma (I don't have diabetes, but I'm badly overweight)Appendicitisand now that I'm having nipple pain (I have gynecomastia), I'm convinced I have male breast cancerI'm crying my eyes out right now because I've essentially spent this entire month thinking I'm going to die.  I'm afraid to sleep, afraid to eat, I just want to feel better.  I've dealt with bad anxiety for almost a decade now and I've had enough. I turn 20 in less than a month, and I'm transferring to a new college next month, but in afraid I'm not going to see any of that because I can't keep living like this. I'm afraid to die, yet I want to die.  I'm having a war within myself and I just feel scared.  I want to be better. 
This	have?	This is in no way a competition but i was curious to see how many people have been diagnosed with disorders other than ADHD. So, what disorders do you have? 
I'm	:(	I'm struggling to log off from what ever I'm doing or thinking.  I've adapted the Pomodoro Technique and it's helped in many ways but not with this issue.   It's like I never reach a peak.  EX: After baking a cake, I would feel the urge to bake something else.  Even though I don't want to.  It's like one part of me is never satisfied and the other is mentally exhausted.  :(
I	down?	I took 18mg of Concerta about 10 hours ago, so it should be completely out of my system now.  I had some minor side effects but they didn't bother me too much.  Now, after it's done, I feel more anxious than usual.  How do you calm down? 
I	help.	I frequently lurk around /r/ocd.  Today I came upon this post.  reddit. com/r/OCD/comments/4tesrl/im_ready_to_kill_myself/I'm really worried if he/she is actually going to kill himself/herself soon.  Please help. 
Was	die.	Was super annoyed at all the idiots at my work today but I'm not gonna take it out on myself and poison myself with wine.  Yay day 2.  Resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.  
suicidal	desperately need help	Here's the gist of the situation:* I am  <e1> suicidal </e1> .  * I  <e2> desperately need help </e2> .  * I am more afraid of asking for help than not asking for it. Given these three facts, only one logical conclusion can be drawn: I need some way to get help without asking for it. 
Honestly.	.	Honestly.  I don't know how to put what I'm feeling into words.  Before, my thoughts were loud and jumbled.  Now, everything has gone quiet and I'm numb yet sad at the same time.  Maybe it's time. . . 
suffered silently with OCD since I was 12 years old	have a problem(s) and I am undergoing CBT	I have  <e1> suffered silently with OCD since I was 12 years old </e1>  (I am now in my early 30s).  I have recently admitted I  <e2> have a problem(s) and I am undergoing CBT </e2>  to re-train my brain.  The above question was put to me by my therapist, and I was curious what other people with contamination obsessions would say to this question?
Who	hell.	Who can I call in Ontario, Canada to talk to about getting help? I'm sorry.  I don't know where else to post this.  I'm scared if I call a crisis line and admit I am not medicated, not seeing a DR, and am having violent fantasies unable to stay in reality for more than a few minutes they will lock me up.  There isn't any love left in the world just robots.  I don't want to go back to hell. 
I'm	But	I'm on 20mg Adderall XR (w/ 10mg IR booster) daily. I am trying to take a break on weekends to slow down tolerance.  But
My	followup.	My last three were scheduled at 2:30, this one was at 2.  I even wrote it down wrong in my planner. I just had to tell someone.  I kinda feel like shit.  I'm not getting a followup. 
I can't be prescribed for medication	money issues	I've been drinking copious amounts of caffeine and it always seems to help me focus and calm me down.  Unfortunately  <e1> I can't be prescribed for medication </e1>  because of  <e2> money issues </e2> .  But how effective is caffeine on an ADHD person?
So	.	So I work as a kid check attendant at Chuck E Cheese and well it involves very little movement.  I tend to get bored and space out .  Any advice for staying focused , so I don't get my ass fired .  
when he tries to explain something he gets flustered and freaks out or gives up	he can't explain it how he wants	My son is a bright 6 year old, no problems learning.  (He is in his gt program if it makes a difference) he also has ADHD and is medicated.  Lately I've noticed  <e1> when he tries to explain something he gets flustered and freaks out or gives up </e1>  because  <e2> he can't explain it how he wants </e2> .  I try and tell him to just take his time but he ends up in a meltdown.   I have no idea how to help or what is wrong.   Any tips!?
I've	me?	I've isolated myself from everyone for a few weeks, and I really need someone to read all my shit and reply back with. . .  something.  Anything.  Just a one time thing.  Can anyone please PM me?
I don't feel any positive emotion, and act happy and everything with everyone	my sister passed 5 years ago	 <e1> I don't feel any positive emotion, and act happy and everything with everyone </e1> , it tires me,  <e2> my sister passed 5 years ago </e2>  which is probably the cause, I also left school last year and have only seen my friends about 4-5 times since then, any advice would be appreciated, thanks
I've	is	I've been in a disassociated state for 2 days.  This happens frequently especially when I'm triggered (isn't just a SJW term) and the PTSD kicks in. Anyway.  That happened so I've been in a extremely depressed state and disassociated for two days.  Not sure how to snap out of it.  And for those of you who don't know what disassociation is
I'm	me?	I'm 17, and I met this older guy on Tinder.  Way older.  He's 45.  I snuck out in the middle of the night and we made out in his car, he saw me naked, etc.  The legal age in my state is 16, so it's not technically 'worng' even though part of me knows what I'm doing is completely stupid.  After that night I've just been depressed as shit, even though I gave him consent through all of it.  What's wrong with me?
I've	it.	I've never done it before so it worried me.   I just got very upset felt like I was hyperventilating and decided to pick up a picture frame and break it. 
me leaving my comfort zone and not knowing entirely what to expect	it's outside of my normal routine	Anyone else get really hardcore traveling anxiety? Everyone assumes that I mean I'm a nervous flyer but it's not that at all.  It's the idea of  <e1> me leaving my comfort zone and not knowing entirely what to expect </e1>  because <e2>  it's outside of my normal routine </e2> .  Any tips on how to overcome it? 
Hi.	laziness	Hi.  I'm a 23 year old former college drop out.  I'm scared as hell. Like most of you, I've messed up a lot.  School has always been a nightmare.  When I was a kid, my parents would get violently angry at my laziness
my	old!	my major negative side effect so far from quitting is crazy dreams. . . like hour after hour. . . all night. . . every messed-up thing you could imagine. . . others who have had this experience, how long did it take for things to calm down? it's kind of fascinating but also getting very old!
Hello	too.	Hello guys, I'm interested in joining a SA Discord chat if there's one.  I feel like my social skills are deteriorating from not interacting with people for so long, and I want to practice it with other people who have or are accepting of people with SA.  I also stutter a lot and have weird awkward pauses when I talk, so I would also like to work on my voice too.   
One	it?	One of my main physical symptoms is shortage of breath.  Most of the relaxation techniques use the focus on breathing to calm the body down.  That doesn't help in my case.  Usually it makes it even worse. Does anyone have a similar issue? If so - how do you handle it?
Should	happening.	Should I be worried that I still have RLS and need to take a small dose of Xanax (. 25) to sleep at night?  I was thinking of trying to go without it tonight but my legs are going crazy so I don't think that's happening. 
I	late.	I want to end it.  Right now it seems that everyone I know is mad at me.  Most of them for reasons that are out of my control.  My whole life is a mess and it would be easier to end it.  But I guess this is still just a cry for help or I wouldn't be on here.  So let's see if anyone can change my mind before its too late.  
Is	sleep?	Is convincing yourself to get up when there is no way you can get any sleep.  I usually just stay at bed, look at the ceiling thinking I will fall asleep any minute then.  Mostly I don't and just get frustrated even more.  How do I fix this? Is there any way to start doing things when you are really tired but can't sleep?
Tried	:(	Tried to not let SA get in the way of what I want so after years of being too scared to, I finally tried to pursue someone and I get rejected. .  have been depressed the past 2 days :(
I'm so nervous	I hate public speaking	I need to present a legal studies presentation, I have que cards and all but  <e1> I'm so nervous  </e1> because  <e2> I hate public speaking </e2> , what do i do?
.	support).	. . .  good mother/daughter relationships and happy families in general.   Like the Weasleys in Harry Potter.   I want to daydream a bit, as I think it will help me mourn for what I didn't have growing up (an affectionate mother, emotional support). 
Hey,I	do?	Hey,I take medikinet 10 mg 3x a day. After lets say 16:00-17:00 i feel super stressed out and getting cold even though I'm eating and drinking water.  Noises are getting really annoying and people stress me way too much.  I'm also really cold. . . What can i do?
I	Advice?	I wake up with panic attacks in the middle of the night, so much so that nowI am afraid to go to sleep.  Anybody else experience this? Advice? 
I	Sunday!!	I want to thank everyone here for helping me along during this first month sober.  I'm loving it, beginning to hear myself again, and am looking forward to being sober tomorrow,too!Take care , and happy Sunday!!
I	Help.	I know this is silly, but not for an anxiety sufferer, I got a cold about 3 days ago and now I feel like I'm dying, Help.  
$	you	$ X amount of money is being used completely by her mom and I'm wondering if there could be something done about it?Her mom told her that her dad had stopped paying but that was a lieI'm really concerned cause that money is really vital for some expenses that are really importantThank you
Yep,	one.	Yep, it's me.  Don't care that I'm only a couple days in.  Still sober, and really happy to come back here tonight.  Hope everyone had a good one. 
I	anxiety	I have what my doctor calls extreme general anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, depressive disorder along with PTSD caused by sexual assault and rape (2 occasions) (not technically diagnosed).  I feel constant baseline of relatively low levels of anxiety
So	too.	So today I was getting burgers from my mom and some guy working on the tile thought it was for him.  It was so awkward to let him know it was for me and my brother instead of him and his partner.  I'm just so depressed it was so awkard.  He barley speaks english too. 
I	point?	I feel fed up.  Normally I'm not this angry but fuck it.  After spending so many years trying to do well in school, be a good person, a good worker, a good wife, I feel it's all bullshit.  Nobody cares about anyone but themselves.  People offer you advice but really it's just self aggrandizing and makes them feel better about themselves.  People want to be better, and some are so shitty that they'll abuse others at their own expense.  We ignore the people who need the most help, the most hurt, ignored, gentle people.  And glorify the shitheads who take our money in the name of some political or religious endeavor when really they're just sociopath types who don't give a fuck about anyone.   We put on airs and pretend we have this fucking life figured out when we're just evolved mammals on this billions of year old rock making up stupid shit and stories about God and what's real.  None of it is real, love exists if we choose to believe it in our minds, no one is coming to save us.  Even philosophy seems like a waste of time.  What's the point?
I get really angry	my bones start to shake	So I've been noticing some things.  When  <e1> I get really angry </e1> ,  <e2> my bones start to shake </e2> .  I get the rush of blood and thrill of being angry.  But I have managed to NOT say anything I would regret soon after.  I was just wondering, is it normal to feel excited when you're angry?
i am confused scared frustrated	picking up a white chip still having not drank	I had nearly three years clean and smoked weed for the past year, daily, all day, main priority.  Fake rationalized manageability, and drifted away from aa completely.  Did not drink.  Stopped smoking a week ago, it was causing problems and my sig o helped me re-evaluate my new old new habit.  I want to go back to the rooms but  <e1> i am confused scared frustrated </e1>  about  <e2> picking up a white chip still having not drank </e2> .  My sickness says if i am picking up a white chip why not have some drinks.  I am worried I will resent myself. . . or something.  Anyone relate?EDIT: Thank you folks for the reminder of how it really is.  I have been basing a lot of real feelings on hypothetical conversations and situations while the reality is that my cannabis use was kicking up the same behaviors and was leading me back to the drink.  It is the first big step in the wrong direction.  Not many people have the opportunity to come close to the edge and check themselves.  What I learned from yall and reaching back out to an old friend from the rooms is that I need to get back in there and do the thing.  Thanks. 
The	this.	The first time, I put the clothes in and forgot to turn the washing machine on. The second time, I turned it on and let it do the whole cycle before realizing I had completely forgot to add detergent. The third time I finally did it and went to hang the clothes out to dry, only to get distracted by something else in the middle of it and leave half of them still in the basket. Nailed it! Explaining ADHD to my boyfriend was way easier after this. 
So,	treated?	So, I tell him about my miserable life and eventually cry.  He tells me, Its going to be OK.  When do you want to come again? Where's the medication or career help? Is this normal?How long into the therapy are you formally diagnosed and treated?
She	I'm still alive	 <e1> She </e1>  was all I had and probably the reason  <e2> I'm still alive </e2> .  I loved her more than anything else in my life.  Everything we planned out together is no more.  I have no more future to look forward to.  I had originally planned to kill myself by a certain time (next summerish) until I met her.  Now I don't know what to do.  Please make the pain go away. . . 
I have this beautiful fucking woman in my life and I can't do anything	I'm nervous	Hi guys.  I'm a healthy, 18 year old male.  Got a girlfriend that I am super attracted to about 2 weeks ago.  About a month ago my dick stopped acting like a normal hormone fueled dick.  Getting hard almost never happens.  Ever.  Jerking off feels so forced.  I literally comfortably went a week without doing anything and can't remember if I got hard at all during that week.  Anyways onward to the Girl.  We'll call her Danny.  Super sweet, smart, perfect and extremely attractive.  I hit a homerun with this one.  We are super happy together.  But I just struggle to maintain an erection for long enough to transition into anything past 2nd base.  I guess my question is, is this normal? Is it a thing some developing teens occasionally go through? Please help.  A month ago I could jerk off to a trash bag if it looked feminine enough.  Now  <e1> I have this beautiful fucking woman in my life and I can't do anything </e1> .  I want to.   <e2> I'm nervous </e2> .  I dont want her to think Im not attracted to her.  Help.  Please help this is killing me.  
Any	online	Any Australians here that's prescribed schedule 8 medication know of the regulations around getting your repeats filled? I'm about a week out from it being a month since I last had a script filled for vyvanse and can't find my remaining pills, misplaced them somewhere at home.  Can I get my next repeat now? Or are there strict regulations in place? No big deal if I have to wait a week.  I may find them between now and then anyway, but also curious about the answer to this I can't find much info online 
I just took a pregnancy test that was faintly positive	My husband and I are excited	Hi All,I've been NC with my family for 3 months.   I have a one year old - the first grandchild.     <e1> I just took a pregnancy test that was faintly positive </e1> .    <e2> My husband and I are excited </e2>  and we will take another test in a couple days.   I know I will struggle with whether or not to tell them and, if so, when.  What do you all think?Thank you!
Hi.	asap.	Hi. So, I'm like a closet-depressed person.  I have certain triggers that will hit me, and once they do, I get so far down you'd need a super drill to find me again.  Today is one of those days - *and it's not an appropriate one*.  I've recently hit a happy period of my life, and met someone that now matters a lot to me.  I'm not yet ready to introduce this person to the dark hole that is my depression.  I realize it's going to have to happen some day, but I'm not ready to have that day come this week.  So I need to keep a positive outlook and not appear as broken as I feel. What do you guys do to get momentarily over your depression in order to function in your day to day life? I cannot figure this out right now on my own, and I **need** this sorted out asap. 
I'm	meds?	I'm having troubles sleeping in for the last couple of days now.  Since I started, to use 54mg of Concerta a day instead of 36mg.  At eleven twelve o'clock I'm still wide awake.  Normally, I slept for 7-8 a night but now it's down to 4/5 hours a night.  Did any of you have the same problems when you increase the dosage of your meds?
It really dawned on me today as I went out to one of my classes that I am extremely insecure about almost everything	it makes me dysfunctional	 <e1> It really dawned on me today as I went out to one of my classes that I am extremely insecure about almost everything </e1> , and  <e2> it makes me dysfunctional </e2> .  I worry about my clothes.  I have no fashion sense and the clothes I wear are really plain.  I'm always worried that people are thinking I look trashy or ugly.  I worry about how I smell.  I shower thoroughly and use deodorant, yet I'm always paranoid that I smell bad and other people can tell.  I'm always worried that people are looking at my hair and thinking I look stupid.  And worst of all, I worry that people are thinking that I look ugly on the inside too.  I'm extremely introverted and avoidant and I feel like everyone is frowning on me for it. Help me! I want to stop feeling this way.  I want to just not care what anyone is thinking.  I'm so tense all the time!
I decided to post here today	I feel like I'm a bit lost and confused about what I'm going through	Thank you in advance if you read this for me.   <e1> I decided to post here today </e1>  because  <e2> I feel like I'm a bit lost and confused about what I'm going through </e2> .  My whole life I've noticed I worry easily, but I thought that was just how I was.  I'm 20 years old now and I find myself worrying all the time.  I worry every day, sometimes multiple times per day, about close loved ones dying.  My girlfriend of 5 years is always in my head as I think of her getting in a car accident.  Also, I am constantly worrying about my health.  I'm not unhealthy, 5'10 195lbs
I still feel bad about separating myself from my dad	how frequently he puts on this pitiful	I am realizing that one reason  <e1> I still feel bad about separating myself from my dad </e1>  is because of  <e2> how frequently he puts on this pitiful </e2> , dejected face.   He will act very forlorn and overcome by different situations in his life (like his stressful job, or not seeing his children enough) and mope around, and seem so exhausted.   I just have so many visions of him in my head like this over the years. In the past (from a pretty young age) I always tried to comfort him, and encourage him, and tell him things would be okay.   Sometimes that would get him out of his sad, upset moods. . . sometimes it wouldn't. Even though I know it is wrong to put this much pressure on a child from a young age. . . I still sometimes feel like I am abandoning him, or I feel sorry for him and don't want him to be lonely or melancholy.   I still sometimes feel such guilt, although not as much as frequently as I used to I suppose. DAE experience this?

i	around.	i think that i'm sure that i'll be leaving soon.  when is still unclear, but the timing will never be right.  i'm just worried about what'll happen once im gone.  if anyone here has gone through another family member, you know, i would appreciate hearing about your experience.  i don't think my siblings will be too bothered, it's my parents i'm worried about, and who will answer the door for my little brother and sister when i'm not around. 
Recently,	ideas.	Recently, in the moments when I'm overwhelmed by huge waves of anxiety, I've developed a picking scratching habit.  Picking at my skin, picking skin off my lips with my teeth, scratching my legs literally to the point where they're bleeding.  It's super disgusting, and unhealthy, and leads to pain down the road, and even though it feels good and is a distraction from the anxiety in that moment I really really really want to stop; does anyone have any advice?? It started maybe a few months ago and has really been picking up recently.  Please help if you have any ideas.  
ADVICE	?	ADVICE NEEDED- boyfriend has bpd and we have been together for over a year.  Everyone around him has said I'm a great influence on him and since meeting he has communicated very well with me when he's shutting down or blowing up.  Sex at the start was typically amazing and intense but after three months he has completely lost interest and when I talk to him about it he shuts down and won't talk( even tho we can talk about all his other feelings) has anyone else experienced anything like this before ? 
I can't go to class	I can't stop crying	I feel so alone and helpless.  I attend music school, which is intensive and requires many hours of practice that I just can't do.  How am I supposed to go through college and complete assignments when I hate myself more than anything? My emotions are getting the best of me.   <e1> I can't go to class </e1>  because  <e2> I can't stop crying </e2> .  I just think about how much of a colossal loser I am and it just goes south from there.  I used to be on meds but they made me throw up all the time so I stopped cold turkey How am I supposed to be successful when I know for a fact that I cannot keep going? I can't take much more of this whole life thing.  Been having some seriously harmful thoughts.  I've never felt this low before.  People look down upon me now.  That kid who can't hold it togetherIdk what to do
I'm	change	I'm pretty sure I have NPD and I'm just attention-seeking on this forum and I just. .  my mind is deteriorating a lot and I feel like I'm drowning in this profound black hole I can't rise above from I'm too scared to look for a psychiatrist and a therapist and I don't know anymore the older I'm getting the more responsibilities I'm supposed to have I wish I was smart enough to even concoct a suicide attempt, I'm too afraid to live too afraid to die I'm stuck in this eternal limbo and I'm afraid of change 
my doc is concerned about the safety of taking the drug	my unhealthy weight	At long last after a 6 month [or 15 year depending on how you look at it] battle I have an Rx for adderall xr 10mg in my hand.  I havent taken it for ten years, but last time it was a miracle drug for me. I currently weight 330 lbs, and  <e1> my doc is concerned about the safety of taking the drug </e1>  given  <e2> my unhealthy weight </e2> .  My cholesterol is surprisingly good for someone of my weight but she nonetheless made it very clear i was taking a risk. additionally I took ritalin a few years back and ended up with full blown anxiety attackes that lasted for monthsIf this stuff doesnt work I dont know what I am going to do.  So I guess my question is, what to expect for the first couple days on the drug, and have any of you expirienced serious side effects like anxiety, and how did you seal with it thanks for your help everyone
the liver can only process 1 oz of alcohol per hour	what makes me drunk	I drink a lot, like 750ml a night for the last 10 years or so. My friend keeps telling me it doesnt matter because  <e1> the liver can only process 1 oz of alcohol per hour </e1> .  So is that  <e2> what makes me drunk </e2> ? I overload my liver? or My perception of time gets skewed cause im drunk and  I don't know it actually took 7 hours to process the liquor. I classify myself as a panic drinker I hit the bottle with a panicked sense of not catching a buzz or getting drunk so I will gulp down 4-6 oz of gin at a time every 30-60mins to make sure I get to where I want but every fucking time I end up asleep. so ELI5
So	goes.	So I guess this is it, 24 hours down and the rest of my life in front of me.  I feel free right now.  I can do whatever I want to without waiting to sober up to drive.  Here goes.  
My	her?	My 7 year old daughter is very close to being diagnosed with ADHD-PI (we are just waiting for the psychologist's written report, but he agrees that this is what she has).  I am worried about my daughter and how lonely she is at school.  I think her distraction and angry outbursts are driving the other kids away. Did this happen to any of you? What was your experience? How can I help her? tl;dr: 7 year old daughter with ADHD-PI.  She is struggling to keep friends and is sad and lonely at school.  How can I help her?
I've	ask.	I've posted here before about mine and my bf's anxiety.  He's been on Lexapro for about 8 months and has continued to drink while on it.  Lately, it seems that he is completely irrational and aggressive when he's been drinking.  And that wasn't always the case.  Has anyone had any experience with it? He rarely seems to remember if we got in arguments after a night of drinking.  Does it cause a blackout effect? Not really sure what I'm asking.  But it's been a bad night.  And I just wanted to ask.  
Nothing	again	Nothing seems more satisfying to me anymore than the thought of closing my eyes and never having to open them again
I need help staying sober	right now I'm planning my relapse	 <e1> I need help staying sober </e1> , because  <e2> right now I'm planning my relapse </e2> . I relied on alcohol to modulate several major areas of my behaviour: primarily as a vent against stress unhappiness/general shit, but it also served a key role in my appetite and sleep habits. Yes I know about the downsides - I wouldn't be here if I wasn't acutely aware how much it sucks to be drinking - but my problem is that none of the benefits of being sober line up with the benefits of being an alcoholic. Most of all, and I'm asking for specific help here: I need some way of venting stress, of being able to take a time-out from life.  A shitty few days and a poor night's sleep are all it will take to derail me, to make me need to 'tap out'. . .  and I don't want that relief to come from alcohol anymore, but I do fucking need that relief. And I'm sorry if this is out of bounds: but I'm perfectly happy to substitute other drugs for alcohol, other addictions even.  Being an addict isn't my problem, being addicted to a substance where the 'high' is literally your body succumbing to poison is. 
Nmom sees a therapist several times a month	various issues	For the full(er) back story  is my previous post.  But long story short, in the future I may be moving far awat and Nmom is already threatening suicide, claiming she will die, and telling me that I'm all she has to live for. So anyway,  <e1> Nmom sees a therapist several times a month </e1>  for  <e2> various issues </e2>  (none of them are her issues directly though).  She went to another therapist appointment and talked about the possibility of me moving far away.  When she came home she said to me My therapist agrees with me that you won't be moving across the world.  Even she knows that you're all I have and that I can't make it without you! She's also made several comments before about her therapist agreeing with her on things that sound suspicious to me. So
Adderall	you!	Adderall has made me aware to a lot of blind spots in my life.   However, I find that I'm more prone to talk when I'm on it, and not always in a good way.   In retrospect, it's almost rambling and droning.   Sometimes I feel like I talk longer about subjects that aren't as interesting to people as I think they are. I'm working on abbreviating and reigning my thoughts while on it now.   Also, listening more to other people and adjusting to their cues. Part of me wonders if there's a correlation to me thinking this way when I'm interested, and if this is the manifestation of that in Adderall.   OR, if I've always been rambly and droning when I speak about things I'm excited about. Let me know if this effects you!
I'm	language	I'm new to this Reddit thing but it looks like a safe space to vent a little.  I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 15 (I'm 26 now) and only attempted once.  I'm happily married, have a great family and a good job.  But all the time I just feel drawn to the subject of suicide and constantly feel that there's not really a point for anything.  I feel either empty and bored or scared most of the time.  Whenever I feel like that I start thinking of the multiple benefits my death could bring to all my loved ones and I start planning again.  I'm tired of this routine.  Really really tired. Sorry if my grammarwording is bad, English isn't my first language
I	this?	I just feels like it always has to be something.  When I deal with one problem my brain hyper focuses on the next one, and the next one, and the next one.  Even if the problem isn't a big deal I find a way to blow it way out of proportion.  Even when I do get past it I somehow find something else to stress over.  I feel like I am hardwired to worry about something, even if all that accomplishes is making me depressed and anxious to the point of panic attacks.  Anyone else have a problem like this?
I'm worried	I might lock myself out of that grade tonight, with this one exam	So, I'm taking calculus 2 (five years after I took calc 1) and I have to pass it this semester to finish my degree.   It's my fault for putting it off so long, but I have an exam tonight and I'm so.  Fucked.   So.   Fucked. I only have to get a C in the course for it to count towards my degree, but  <e1> I'm worried </e1>  that  <e2> I might lock myself out of that grade tonight, with this one exam </e2> .   I might fuck up so badly that I physically cannot graduate, making the rest of this school year useless and the rest of my life meaningless.  If I don't pass this course, I literally do not know what I'm going to do.   I do not know what my life looks like after tonight ifwhen I bomb this exam; it feels like everything I value, everything I've planned for, is swirling the drain right now. If I don't pass, I have seriously considered dropping out or worse.   I'm so scared.   I have been shaking all day, I had a panic attack last night while trying to study.   I'm fucked.   I'm so fucked. 
ruin my daughter's life	being depressed and boring all the time	Today I made pact with myself, I'm going to force myself to be happy.  Been living in this fucking hell called life for too long, I have 2 beautiful young daughters and one on the way.  I can't keep living life this, go to work, come home then just drink liquor until passing out.  I can't  <e1> ruin my daughter's life </e1>  by  <e2> being depressed and boring all the time </e2> , I don't even spend time with them.  My wife is sick of my shit and threatening to leave me if I don't change.  So today while working I decided I will no longer be this depressed boring person.  I will start by being more active and changing my diet, maybe that will give me the will to start this journey, life is too short to be miserable.  Tired of wishing I was dead and contemplating suicide, fuck it.  I'll be dead one day right? I will just try to enjoy every moment with my daughters and atleast try for their sake.  Anyway I'm sorry, just had to vent a little
I	disappear?	I noticed that out of the few of my dreams which actually involve normal everyday social interactions, rarely can I think of one in which I felt noticeably anxious- usually in these dreams I'm uncharacteristically charismatic or easygoing, almost to the point where it's like I'm a different person.  I imagine it probably has to do with the fact that my brain is creating all of these situations so there isn't really anything that I have to react to, it's essentially a one-sided conversation lol.  anyway, I was curious to know what it's like for everyone else.  are you regularly socially anxious in your dreams or does your SA seem to disappear?
I begged for help and got written off	I don't want attention	After twenty seven yeara it seems it's over for me.  I've been depressed since my teens and can't seem to get out of it.  Yesterday is what's sealed the deal for me.  I had an appointment for a follow up on how I am doing and when I stated I'm feeling really depressed I was told I don't seem that depressed.  And that having ups and downs were normal on medication.   <e1> I begged for help and got written off </e1>  it seems for wanting attention.   <e2> I don't want attention </e2>  I wanted a normal life.  I've worked hard to make my life better and everything just falls apart in front of me.  I even ended talking to a helpline tonight and just got rushed to get off it seems like. Whatever, it's not going to matter in a day or two.  Maybe I'll finally get the peace I've been seeking for years. 
I'm	smoke.	I'm about to turn 25 and I can't go on the next year or 5 years not knowing what it's like to not smoke for a significant amount of time.  I feel like my memory is so bad. . .  I don't get lazy(even though I feel like I do) but have some bad habits from being high almost all day. . .  I've quit a few weeks at a time, but I gotta go longer to get my shit together! Right now I feel like I can't even have a normal conversation with 90% of the world.  Everything like confidence, relationships, job, etc seems like it fluctuates up and down in my head every other hour. . .  There's more I want to say but let's say I chose to quit for 4 months. . .  Just have to think of it as what is 4 months of my life that I'm hopefully making changes for the better, and by the time I reach a certain point hopefully won't even want to smoke. 
he concluded that my symptoms were indeed telling him I had ADHD	He prescribed Strattera for me	This past Friday I described to my doctor that I had been feeling that I had problems with my attentiveness for years now.   He gave me a quick test by asking me questions which would help him determine if I had ADHD.  After many questions  <e1> he concluded that my symptoms were indeed telling him I had ADHD </e1> .    <e2> He prescribed Strattera for me </e2> .  Until then, I had never heard of it.   That night I researched it and noticed it made many feel fatigued and drowsy.   In others it made them depressed or have increased feelings of anxiety.   My question to you guys is whether you think Strattera will help with my focus or if I will eventually feel the negative side effects and have to be prescribed another medication.   Ex: vyvanse, adderall, ritalin, ect.   Also let me know if you have ever taken Strattera or are currently taking it and how it either helps you or not.   Thanks in advance!
So my step mom has been hiding from the police for almost two years.  She just barely turned herself in	I have to deal with that	So, my lifes been pretty bad, but not as bad as some people you know. . .  It's just lifes gotten harder.  To much to even bear.  It started about two weeks ago.  <e1> So my step mom has been hiding from the police for almost two years.  She just barely turned herself in </e1> , so  <e2> I have to deal with that </e2> .  Second, school just sucks.  I've skipped the past week and my dad found out and now I'm grounded.  My mom doesn't trust me at all.  I just can't explain the emotions going on through my head. . .  It's like why was I put on this earth? To be a fuck up? No.  I just can't shake my mind off just popping in pills and falling asleep and never walking up again.  It beats staying in this sad world.  Update: I'm 16 and a girl by the way.  I've been feeling better.  There is timed where I just don't even want to go near my dad, but the way how I fix that, I just stay away from him. 
Should	.	Should i get drunk as fast as possible or what, its new situation for me,really, i've never experienced any birthday party since like 10 years and im 20 now. .  There will be a LOT of alcohol, all new people except my girlfriend and her sister(she is 25). How not to be weirdo, jesus christ, im anxious when i think about that, i can handle coversation with one person, but having fun with more then like 10 people? No, i cant. And another thing, im not experienced with drinking much, we will drink  vodka(common thing in Poland) and im afraid that i wont handle much, i dont wanna vomit. . 
What	lot.	What started out as practice drawing turned into an externalization of my inner critic.  As it turns out, sometimes I'm really hard on myself.  I mean brutally hard.  Here are the [hand drawings] I ended up with.  It's in comic book form, and the drill sergeant narrating is me, talking to me.  Hope you like it, and I hope it helps some of you.  Writing it all down helped a lot. 
Does	people.	Does anyone have a clever but simple format they follow for setting goals? I was only diagnosed just under 2 years ago with ADHD, inattentive.   I struggle with staying motivated and setting even the smallest goals.   I've tried putting them into groups ie personal, financial, work, health etc but I find that I'll write it down on a notebook and then completely forget about it or just get too overwhelmed and lose interest.   Would love to hear what works for other people.  
I'm	sleeping	I'm unsure of when I should go to the hospital for my anxiety, panic attacks, self harm.  I've recently spiralled into a dark place where I'm overwhelmed and am isolated and alone.  Do I go to emergency next time I have an attack? Or should I go when I feel like I'm about to self harm? I'm not sure but I know I need help- I just don't know where or when to go. Edit: I'm currently on 150mg of Effexor (Venlafaxine), . 25mg of Xanax (Aprazolam), and 7. 5 mg of Zopiclone for sleeping
It's	real.	It's a little bit funny but today a family member came into where I work and attempted to 'Flying Monkey' me and I shut that shit down.  My Nmother has not attempted to speak to me in any way for a long time now, however I am aware she's complained to other family members about me not talking to her (but HAS NOT tried talking to me herself wtf?) and told them that 'I'm working so much etc etc etc insert negative stuff about me here.  This family member started to mention what my Nmother said but I just stopped the conversation from even happening, Instead we talked about what to do at a family event coming up.  I am going through so many emotions atm though now I'm happy that I can see through the Shit coloured glass that is my Nmother.  Everything I ever suspected she does is real.  
I	happiness.	I can't stop getting into my head and overthinking nearly any and everything.  Just stupid stuff that shouldn't be an issue will cause me to feel like shit, get frustrated or just doubt myself to the point that I feel paranoid.  It's not effecting anything too drastically but I find myself getting really depressed about it.  If I complain too much to friends or family, if they think I'm crazy or not. I don't know exactly what kind of question I'm asking here, but any tips on not overthinking and getting into my head? I wish I could just live in the present for a moment and not dwell on the past or what it could mean for the future.  Overthinking and getting into my head about everything little stupid thing is ruining my happiness. 
Thanks to good parents and teachers	I was able to develop some decent coping skills before starting on 10mg Ritalin in my Senior year of high school, which has carried me pretty effectively until today	So I was one of the first to be diagnosed in the fourth grade as ADHD-PI (long enough ago that they called it ADHD-Non Hyperactive).   <e1> Thanks to good parents and teachers </e1>   <e2> I was able to develop some decent coping skills before starting on 10mg Ritalin in my Senior year of high school, which has carried me pretty effectively until today </e2>  (some 7 years later). While I've overcome some obstacles, such as coming to grips with my ensuing depression and memory issues, most of the obstacles I've hit haven't been too daunting.  The only exception being one bad habit:While I actively seek out the means to remain organized, I often find myself becoming bored with whatever system I'm currently using and discarding it quickly.  After my schedule goes to complete disarray, I'll find some new fresh way to regain order and the cycle will repeat itself in another month or so. So my question is this: Those of you who've found effective means of calendering to-do lists, what was it that made them stick or stay interesting and effective? What advice would you have for maintaining a calendar planner consistently?Edit: New to Reddit
I am wondering if this could be too low of a dose for now	the few times I have actually had coffee I fell asleep almost immediately	My doc prescribed me 5mg of XR for the first week and 10mg XR for the next three.   When I took it this morning I felt nothing, bit after a couple hours I started getting dry mouth and an increased heart rate.   About an hour later I get extremely tired and fell asleep.    <e1> I am wondering if this could be too low of a dose for now </e1> , as  <e2> the few times I have actually had coffee I fell asleep almost immediately </e2> .   I plan to stay on my dosage prescribed, but could there be a correlation?
its just always in the back of my mind and regularly stops me posting here and asking you guys for help	I'm worried that someone who knows me will somehow stumble across it	I love this place and find you guys really helpful.  There's stuff I really need to talk about but I have this irrational terror when posting that if I go into the slightest detail about my story/situation that I'll be identified by someone that knows me.  Which I know is a crazy small chance that anyone in my tiny social circle will see what I post here, much less even if they do see it that they will be able to clock that it's me.  I'm just one person in one town in one country out of the billions and billions of other people that are in the world, the chances are little better than impossible.  But even so,  <e1> its just always in the back of my mind and regularly stops me posting here and asking you guys for help </e1> , because  <e2> I'm worried that someone who knows me will somehow stumble across it </e2> , add 2+2 together and somehow get 76. Anyone else get that?
our aunt has anxiety and is prescribed xanax	we gave my brother a small amount to help out	Last Thursday my brother had a panic attack.  He thought his friend had slipped adderal in his coffee after they had discussed using it to study (both high level mechanical engineering students).  He thought he was overdosing, but he was having a true panic attack.  Everything was cool over the weekend.    <e1> our aunt has anxiety and is prescribed xanax </e1> , so  <e2> we gave my brother a small amount to help out </e2> .  He was going to come back to school, drop a class, get a meal plan to stay steady with eating, and make regular appointments with a counselor. This past Monday, he had an appointment with a counselor at 4pm.  From looking at his texts (sorry I had to reply to people asking him what was wrong) he was fine at 3:00.  He was texting his psychologist that he was in the health center making the appointment, it all seemed fine.  What it seems from my investigating
I've had fairly severe anxiety surrounding death	I can't come to terms with the fact that I will die.  It overwhelms me and scares me and I don't know what to do about it	For a while now  <e1> I've had fairly severe anxiety surrounding death </e1>  --  <e2> I can't come to terms with the fact that I will die.  It overwhelms me and scares me and I don't know what to do about it </e2> .  Everything reminds me of this (I see some cute cat in a window? Well crap, that cat's going to die one day and it will be. . .  nothing).  I get that we should try to be happy in life, but it all seems so pointless.  I've dealt with depression in the past, but in some senses this almost seems worse. . .  I'm trying to find a therapist, but it's harder than I thought.  
1.	life.	1.  How do you deal with the anger at the narcissist in your life ? I had an nmom and I'm angry that my childhood was taken from me. 2.  Being in relationship or trying to form relationships with people, I'm so defensive and I constantly think those close to me are out to get me, everyone hates me, I don't know how to get rid of this mentality. 3.  How do you trust love, how do you know your falling in love or surrounding yourself with a narcissist ? 4.  What steps have you taken to recover, recently stopped talking to my mom this summer and overwhelmed and feel I'm permanently messed up and that I won't be able to ever be in a 'normal' place in my personal life. 
Does	sigh.	Does anyone else out there have almost all of their anxiety primarily stem around work? Even when I'm not there, I am almost constantly thinking about it.  Been this way for over 2 years now, despite not having any major problems or write ups with supervisors.  Tonight I wrote my cycle down just to physically see it:Monday-Friday = Anxiety around 10pm until falling asleep.  Anxiety and dread upon waking up, anywhere from 6-8am.  Friday-Saturday night = extreme relief, feeling of happiness and freedom.  Sunday afternoon = slow creep of existential dread.  Feeling slight pit in bottom of stomach.  Sunday night = worst of all.  Total dread and anxiety take over of mind.  Contemplate quitting job.  Contemplate embarrassment shame over quitting said job.  Proceed to weigh pros of quitting vs.  cons of quitting.  -Repeat on a weekly basis and wash down with some vodka sodas every weekend night.  Am I the only one with obsessiveness like this? I have had 2 career type jobs, decently paid with no write ups or concerns, yet this always happens. . . sigh.  
On days like these, I wake up in the morning and I can barely get dressed and ready for the day without being distracted.  While at work, I fidget endlessly, surf the Internet, and set timers for small-tasks only to have it run out before I even start attempting	Days like these cause me to feel really down on myself	I am usually pretty good about managing my ADHD symptoms and accomplishing tasks on my to-do list one at a time, yet some days are complete nightmares as far as productivity goes.   <e1> On days like these, I wake up in the morning and I can barely get dressed and ready for the day without being distracted.  While at work, I fidget endlessly, surf the Internet, and set timers for small-tasks only to have it run out before I even start attempting </e1> .   <e2> Days like these cause me to feel really down on myself </e2> , yet I can't seem to get out of my own way.  Today is one of those rough days, and I have already spent 2 hours dodging tasks on my to-do list.  For example: I wanted to read through my Calculus lessons for the week
I can't talk to him about money	he is always stressed	Hello. .  I'm wondering if there is a good way to tell someone they have CPTSD.  my son's dad has all the signs and symptoms, and grew up in a very abusive household.  he won't take any medication for his anxiety, even though it's been prescribed multiple times by multiple doctors usually caused by physical affects.  they say he has too much stress all the time, severe panic attacks, stomach ulcers, etc. .   <e1> I can't talk to him about money </e1> , because  <e2> he is always stressed </e2> .  I bought Pete Walker's book and put it on the coffee table, he denies needing any therapy, and gets very defensive when someone brings up his past.  Just curious if you guys know of anything that would help to break the ice.  tia. 
I	well	I need someone to talk through the day when I'm feeling depressed and thinking of dying to keep me going on.  I'll do the same for you as well
I'm just panicking	overstimulation	I often have panic attacks in crowds or social situations where I feel trapped.  It's like social anxiety, only I'm not anxious about what other people think of me,  <e1> I'm just panicking </e1>  because of  <e2> overstimulation </e2> .  Is there a name for this? 
Pen and paper wouldn't be great	I am running around all day	I want to improve my timeliness-related habits.  I've been one of those people who often arrives late for as long as I can remember.  As part of my efforts to improve, I'd like to track how often I arrive on time, or late, and by how much.  Even better if I can break it down by category (ie I am occasionally a little late to work, I am frequently substantially late to personal commitments) and see average timeliness. I don't have a computer, just an Android.  Haven't seen an app like this, though that would be ideal.  Maybe a mobile friendly spreadsheet?  <e1> Pen and paper wouldn't be great </e1>  because  <e2> I am running around all day </e2> .  Thanks!
Today I have 30 days clean and sober	It feels incredible	 <e1> Today I have 30 days clean and sober </e1> .   <e2> It feels incredible </e2> .  A lot of stuff I spent years running from is coming back but I am so happy that I can face the past now without a drink in my hand.  I feel hope for the future.  Thank you all for being here.  I will not drink today. 
I	lived.	I don't have any skills anymore.  My only value comes from others failure and I'll be damned to be around it forever.  I want to stop being so bored or tortured.  I hate so much.  A static meaningless life should be not lived. 
Gross.	over.	Gross. I knew there would be a couple bottles.  I remember putting a couple there.  There were 10.  I'm glad I'm not adding to the pile.  I'm glad I don't need to.  I hope I never trick myself into thinking I need to again.  If I weren't my only employee, I'd seriously consider firing myself.  I should have, many times over.  
it freaks me out	If I hear something I have to constantly make sure what it really was.   If my shoes make a noise, I do it over and over again making the same noise to tell myself that it's not schizophrenia	Then I purposely look around to make sure I'm not seeing things (which is making my brain image images of People that I know are not a reality)  but then like  <e1> it freaks me out </e1>  that it's the onset of it.   <e2> If I hear something I have to constantly make sure what it really was.   If my shoes make a noise, I do it over and over again making the same noise to tell myself that it's not schizophrenia </e2> .  I got a official diagnosis that I have ptsd ocd which is from ptsd.  Ive read so many stuff on it that I think I'm getting psydo symptoms and I'm afraid of a self fulfilling prophecy.  People have told me many times what you think, you become and god will curse me if I walk out of church.   The law of attraction is another thing which freaks me out that it might become true.   I hate that I think like this.   I'm sick of imaging things that are not there (to be clear I know it's my imagination)  which leads to a vicious cycle like is it the onset of it?
but	selfish?	 but met a girl who smoke crack like a fiend who is nice on the inside but is a wreck.  I really want to help her but I'm afraid it will bring me down.  is that selfish?
I haven't ever made it this far before	I was hesitant to post	 <e1> I haven't ever made it this far before </e1> , so  <e2> I was hesitant to post </e2>  if I was just going to fail.  Somehow failure is (seems) worse if others know about it.  Anyway, I did one hour of hypnotherapy on Saturday and felt Amazing coming out of there.  I felt so good and sure of myself.  Had some craving related anxiety here and there but in all been doing just fine. Usual stuff, probably am gaining a little weight, and am waking up weird times of the night, but I have dodged smoking any cigarettes and that's the pointI have continued to drink my coffee, and that hasn't been a problem.  I really really like coffee.  I quit alchohol some years ago, and that was much MUCH more challenging than this, maybe that's why this is seeming pretty easy. 
I've	someone.	I've stopped myself from killing myself every night this week.  I don't know if I can stop myself soon, I might take this down but I need to say something to someone. 
I'm	bipolar?	I'm curious as to what made your psychiatrist or psychologist misdiagnose you as bipolar rather than BPD, what symptoms or examples did you tell them that made them think bipolar? 
I'm having terrible anxiety	about the side effects	So today I took my first dose of propranalol 10mg and it's 2am and I can't sleep.   <e1> I'm having terrible anxiety </e1>   <e2> about the side effects </e2>  and it feels like my heart is racing. . . .  I'm worried it'll make my heart stop beating in my sleep our something. . .  Our that it'll drop my blood pressure really low and I won't be able to tell. . . . .  has anyone had any experiences with this medicine our could give me advice on how to calm down.  This is supposed to help my anxiety not make it worse and I can't handle it at all. . . . 
Hi,	me?	Hi, I have been seeing alcohol workers on nhs in england for 5 month now and my name is still not on a waiting list.  I had my liver checked  in June and my liver enzymes were elevated.  My gp said they would go down after abstinence from alcohol, but name still not on waiting list. I had another blood test on september 16th and my liver enzymes all 3, alt, ast and gamma gt were all in the 300s.  The nurse said they would go down after detox but my doctor said I might have cirrhosis and has booked me in for an ultrasound next month. I'm very scared.  I had an ultrasound last april and all was fine but a fatty liver.  How could i develop cirrhosis in a year from mildy elevated enzymes which were only 67 on a range of below 40.  Is my dr trying to scare me?
I	Thanks.	I have clinical insomnia, and Vyvanse is making it worse.  I take it first thing in the morning.  Pretty sure it's out of my system by bedtime.  I started taking it a week ago.  This side effect should have been gone by now. Does anyone have experience with this? What helped? I don't want to drop down the dose and lose the benefit.  Thanks. 
My	happy.	My father is 6 months clean, and this time next year, I'll be visiting to celebrate my 21st with my mom and dad.  My mother doesn't have an issue with alcohol, so I'm assuming we'll go to a few bars, but obviously not going to a bar with my dad.  I'd go to a hookah bar, as he said he wanted to, but I dunno if he's trying to quit smoking, too, or if smoking will trigger an urge to drink (as he used to drink and smoke for hours).  I'd go out to a restaurant, but most restaurants serve alcohol, and I don't want to trigger his urge to order one, too, especially if I order one.  Should I just lay low with my dad? Or am I way overthinking this? I just want him to be happy. 
I'm	situation.	I'm going on a bike ride then I'll try to sit down and prepare, but I'm just amazed by how calm I am about this normally stressful situation. 
My Mom told me she was heartbroken	she didnt know where her son slept at night	Throwaway.  My mother used me as a tool in a child support battle when I was young.  I lived with my Dad and my little sister lived with my mom and we each went to the others house on weekends.   <e1> My Mom told me she was heartbroken </e1>  that  <e2> she didnt know where her son slept at night </e2>  and gave me a disposable camera to take pictures of my bedroom for her
I have a 7 year old daughter who ends up spending long periods of time in front of the screen of a computer	mommy is sleepy	I need to change something in my life.   Every weekend, I drink.   I drink too much.   I have no memory of nights and even how I ended up in my bed.   Then on Monday mornings, I'm a jittery mess, anxious, mad at myself, depressed.    <e1> I have a 7 year old daughter who ends up spending long periods of time in front of the screen of a computer </e1> , because  <e2> mommy is sleepy </e2> .   I have all these plans for us
After	diagnosis?	After an awful first year of college and lots of difficult talks and fights, and a lot of her being down on herself, and after weeks of waiting for her full report, we finally got a full description of what exactly was different about her.  I am hoping that since she will now be able to get meds and the adequate help/support system she needs, things will start to turn up. How did your life change after getting a solid diagnosis?
After	instructions.	After a recent diagnosis (20 years old), so much of my life makes sense.  Reading people's stories and weird habits with the disorder, made me come to a realization.  It's depressing knowing that all the failures, struggles, shame and guilt was a result of this curse, and I life right now is not how I would always fantasize in my head when I was younger.  I went from being the motivated, crazy idea, creative kid who was never afraid to try anything to a lonely college student who's grades got absolutely destroyed by this University's tough curriculum, creating perpetual insecurity, embarrassment, and shame.  Watching your college buddies succeed socially and academically with 1/4 of the effort and motivation really kills me.  I'm truly stuck.  I wish I could go back to that kid who lived in an environment where I could flourish in.  The meds are no where near a cure.  I no longer live in an environment where I can buy the Lego set, ignore the directions and use the pieces to build upon my own ideas.  I must adapt my brain to the building instructions.  
I have always felt like I am constantly failing myself and my family	not accomplishing work or paying attention in class	As far back in school as I can remember  <e1> I have always felt like I am constantly failing myself and my family </e1>  by  <e2> not accomplishing work or paying attention in class </e2> .  Now, after finding this sub, I feel like I spent the past few hours reading a list of things I hate about myself and behaviors I have that annoy me.  I seriously have trouble remembering times when I wasn't incredibly stressed out and depressed during all 9 months of school.  I always believed that it was just me being a lazy failure. Seriously, reading through the top posts has done more for me than any self help book I have ever read.  I've read about people feeling like they have had a weight lifted off of their shoulders they never knew they were carrying, but now I have first hand experience. 
I've	device	I've been in a 28 day program for 22 days and the people here say I'm doing a good job working the program properly - participating, have a thought out plan for when I get out, call my NA sponsor daily and so on.  BUT, any amount of free time I have I spend on opiates.  I told my sponsor and he thought nothing of it, he just said it doesn't matter as long as you don't use.  I told my counselor here and they threatened to take my device
Never	can't.	Never see a dr about it and really the only reason people know anything is when I freak tf out around then.  I'm just worried that no one will think it's a problem or that they're right and I'm just over reacting to everything.  The only person that really understands wants me to go ask for help but I just feel like I can't.

gets sad easily	she feels like she did something wrong	My girlfriend is usually anxious over the smallest things and  <e1> gets sad easily </e1>  when  <e2> she feels like she did something wrong </e2>  (even though it's very far from it).  We once had a misunderstanding because she was expecting me to understand what was going on but I couldn't and I apologized.  I've read articles that said I should imply that I'm there for her and what not but I want to know if there are other things I could say (because we don't have physical interaction often) to hopefully cheer her up or help her.  
I've been noticing lately that I've been letting confidential shit slip left and right	I feel super guilty about it	Does anyone else absolutely suck at keeping secrets, whether it's yours or someone else's?  <e1> I've been noticing lately that I've been letting confidential shit slip left and right </e1> , and  <e2> I feel super guilty about it </e2> .  It's always to a source that I trust, but I know that the more people know, the more likely the secret will leak.  But any time I get some big, top secret, traumatic news that needs to be kept close to the vest, it slips out at some point.  I don't know why, but for some reason I feel like it's ADHD related and that it's gotten worse in recent years.  I'm to the point where I just want to tell everyone I know not to tell me shit, because I can't promise I'll keep a lid on it. 
We have NO ONE we can TRUST.  We have NO ONE who will NOTICE if we're showing signs of depression	we're freaking INVISIBLE	It sucks.  I was actually hoping they might tell me something useful for a change, but these people seriously DON'T GET how depression works for so many people.  We watched this video with four different kids with depression, and every single one of them had such prominent symptoms someone noticed, or they called a helpline and got help, or they started hanging out with their friends again--but they were all noticed.  They had friends.  They had a life. But so many people here on depression HAVE NO FRIENDS.   <e1> We have NO ONE we can TRUST.  We have NO ONE who will NOTICE if we're showing signs of depression </e1>  because  <e2> we're freaking INVISIBLE </e2> . They always assume family members or close friends will notice.  But so many depressed people have no family members who will pay attention to things like that or any friends at all. It kills me to see people assuming everyone with depression has a completely functional life besides the fact they have a mental illness.  It's like they think the mental illness is a little thing that pops up for a bit, then goes away. 
I biked 20 min to work as usual. Had a black coffee at 9:00 as usual	meds on empty stomach after 3 days break + black coffee	I have emailed my doctor now to ask for advice. nI understand that reddit is no doctor but I thought I asked for your advice anyhow until I get feedback from my doc. Tuesday I have overstimulated myself quite a bit.  I had a 3 day break of my methylphenidate prescription from Saturday to Monday.  Usually I get take it 7/7. My tolerance goes down really fast. Tuesday I picked up the meds again. Tuesday I skipped breakfast and only ate by noon.  Usually I have already 700 kcal until noon. (Trying to lose weight) <e1> I biked 20 min to work as usual. Had a black coffee at 9:00 as usual </e1> . So,  <e2> meds on empty stomach after 3 days break + black coffee </e2> . Had an extremely stimulated day and couldn't sleep until 2am at which point I had 2 glass of scotch 2 full a sleep. Day after I felt like shit, mostly because of the scotch, and the heart palpitations started. Today I feel ok but the palpitations still continue. I plan to take the afternoon off and give me heart as much rest as possible.  Do you think I should take any depressant or just chill?
I have always tried to keep anything related to my mental health very private	I have never had the opportunity to talk to people who may have been in my shoes	Hello, I plan on going to my gp and asking about her about possibly being diagnosed with OCD and treatment options.  <e1> I have always tried to keep anything related to my mental health very private </e1> , and so  <e2> I have never had the opportunity to talk to people who may have been in my shoes </e2> .  I feel a little anxious about meds, so what are your experiences with OCD medication? Has it helped you? Do you experience relief from your compulsions? Does it just make it easier to cope with them? Have any side effects led you to discontinuing meds?
She	question?	She asked me on Monday and it's just starting to set in.  It's like she's suggesting that I am responsible for my anxiety.  Like I sit around and give myself panic attacks all day.  I'm thinking maybe it is time to find a new therapist.  This one sounds like she is getting tired of me. Would you be offended by this question?
I	sick	I am a 30 year old female with OCD.  I'm intelligent.  I know it's irrational.  But sitting here after a VERY long day of work in my apartment alone I can't but think how everything is dirty or contaminated.  I don't know with what.  I'm not afraid of getting sick
As	reduced.	As in the title; when it's time to pack, go around and empty every storage place (wardrobe, safe, drawers, etc) leaving it open once you are done.  You can see at a glance where has (or hasn't) been checked and the risk of leaving anything behind is greatly reduced. 
I also tend to unconsciously disassociate during sex	if I give in	(TW: All, including sexual abuse, eating disorders, suicidal ideation, and self-mutilation)I [28, F] am coming to grips with abuse I did not fully recognize as possibly sexual until recently.  I wanted to share my experience with you guys to gain some insight into what was, for a long time, a long-standing sense of violation that has lurked in my subconscious since I was a child. This is quite long, so thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I have no visual memory of sexual abuse as a child, but I feel like my body remembers.  For example, I can't enjoy receiving sexual pleasure without flashbacks of someone going down on me that I didn't want there.  I cried the first time someone fingered me, even though this person was someone I loved, trusted, and felt completely safe around.   <e1> I also tend to unconsciously disassociate during sex </e1> , because  <e2> if I give in </e2> 
I've	n	I've been more irritated and prone to anger outbursts more than usual.  The thing that seems to work best is stopping everything, eat, and take a nap.  I'm no longer extremely angry, but I'm still too upset to do whatever more productive thing I needed to do. This is very debilitating, but it's been the only effective way to deal, with the exception of holding it all in to keep from blowing up at work. I'm worried that this is going to be it- that it's just the cycle of bipolar disorder that leaves me as just a sick person rather than whatever I'm working toward.  I mean, this is way better than life before medication, but this is rather disappointing.  I never expected to ride out the rest of my life just trying to stay alive, or at least quit walking around like an angry jerk. Anyone else find themselves in the same place? n
Currently	being	Currently thinking about suicide as the title suggests, but do not have a plan or anything. . .  yet at least and idk what to do, I'm so lonely in life and I get little enjoyment from things and I just don't even know how to be able anymore.  When I was a kid I was the happiest kid around but then shit happened and now I'm one of the most depressed people Ik. . .  if I had a gun or my family owned one I'd already be gone. . .  I really just want to go to sleep and just not wake up idc about anyone around me anymore either and so idc how my death will impact them so Idk what else I can tell myself to stop from having these thoughts that consume my very being
Hi	time?	Hi everyone,nMy badge isn't accurate, I'm still smoking.  I think I made it 5 days last time, and I actually had a complete breakdown.  I quit cold turkey once before, lasted 6 months! that was a few years ago.  After several failed attempts since, I'm starting to think cold turkey isn't going to fly.  I've tried the pills, lets just say never again for those.   I'm 57 days alcohol free, i'm not your stereotypical alcoholic but I can't drink like most people.   What are some tips for quitting? How do you know it's the right time? 
The	anymore	The things that make me feel worthless and shitty are pathetic in comparison to what others are struggling with.  But it only makes me feel worse and like im just drowning in pity, denial and just seeking attention. I wrote this down today in my journal, might better capture what im trying to say. I find it depressingly funny how we treat mental illness.  Ive seen people speak out about it on Facebook or to other people were if it doesnt seem real or authentic enough its just people begging for attention.  When people keep it inside and resort to being alone and ignoring others its just bathing in self pity.  Others even get angry for them for not reaching out to others for help or seeking help when it just loops back to the first point? What about people who are depressed with a lack of social skills? Whom struggle to even get a grasp on what they are trying to tell people? I guess what im trying to say through the third person persona here is that I dont know how im supposed to get better.  I cant tell my friends anymore
I keep shelf stable food cuz we're always on the go	I don't wanna forget to pack food and have a hungry child or self	Even when I'm on my meds, at a good dosage, and being compliant with them.  My insurance company screwed me over and right now I'm dealing with an unpredictable living environment, thanks to hubby's alcoholism, so that doesn't help either.  But for the life of me, I cannot keep my car decluttered.  Half of it's my preschoolers stuff and half mine, with a bit of hubby's mixed in.   <e1> I keep shelf stable food cuz we're always on the go </e1>  and  <e2> I don't wanna forget to pack food and have a hungry child or self </e2> .  It gets used constantly.  I keep books on tape for LO, spare shoes,gym clothes, and items for LO to draw and me to jot down notes.  Makeup because I know I'll need it for the times im heading last minute to something I need to be more presentable for.  But man it's a mess! Help? Commiserate?
I	know.	I have wondered for the longest time, do I really have ADHD? Or is it an excuse I created to justify my reluctance to do work I get tired and reluctant (is it even reluctance?) after seeing I have to copy a lot of material sometimes. Same with being depressed (I get depressed sometimes when seeing other people without ADHD and I think about how they have it easy and how i'm inferior).  How do I know it isn't fake? Please shed some light because I need to know. 
Is	similar?	Is it like being drunk but without the drunk part if that makes sense lol, when I drink alcohol I'm cheery, relaxed, confident, low heart rate, no anxiety, etcIs medication similar?
I really like to be unmedicated when I do pre-writing for papers	I feel like it's way easier for me to get down ideas and find connections between them when I'm not on Adderall	Okay so this may seem like kind of a strange question, but how do you guys use the disorder to your advantage? I know that personally for me,  <e1> I really like to be unmedicated when I do pre-writing for papers </e1> , since  <e2> I feel like it's way easier for me to get down ideas and find connections between them when I'm not on Adderall </e2> .  Of course this leads to my essay outlines looking like those conspiracy theory webs, but it's worked pretty well for me.  Then I take my meds wen it's time to actually write and it feels like the paper already wrote itself? Do y'all do anything like this? What do you do?
I'm	me.	I'm awaiting to start treatment and I'm really desperate for some results. Currently I'm averaging some 9 hours per week whereas I'm supposed to be doing close to 10 hours per day.  It's horrible.  My grades are crap.  I suffer from insomnia and constant lethargy and then sometimes I'm like super happy and content and unable to do anything but daydream.  It's like I'm playing life on ultrahard mode.  Sometimes I wake up with plans but then something insignificant goes wrong (like being out of breakfast) and then I have to wash and dress and go to the shops and it seems like an insurmountable mountain of stuff so I end up at 3pm, 9 hours later, just sitting there in my pajamas wondering what is wrong with me.  
So	anxiety?	So I've finally decided to put my foot down and overcome my anxiety and get a social life and make things right. So I've been taking some college courses to ease my self into college and have been thinking about taking a theater class or a communications course not sure, I really need to build up my communication skills and get rid of this anxiety and I also am thinking about applying to a couple jobs in retail or a job being a waiter so I can get use to having to interact with people. Ive also been thinking about going to one of the clubs at my college. I hope I'm taking on to much so I don't become overwhelmed. Any there ideas on how I can build my communication skills and get rid of my anxiety?
I've always been wary about going on medication in the past	I've been on so many and I can never tell if the effects are from the meds or if it's me	I was diagnosed with ADHD in high school, but I ended up leaving for a non-traditional education.  Now, I'm in college and struggling with focusing on my work, and I've been thinking about going on medication for ADHD.  However, [this article]( ms/2dVnYcF) freaked me the fuck out and now I'm worried about going on ADHD meds.   <e1> I've always been wary about going on medication in the past </e1> , because  <e2> I've been on so many and I can never tell if the effects are from the meds or if it's me </e2> .  I feel like I could benefit from ADHD medication, but I don't want it to change me. 
I'm	FUNNY	I'm so suicidal that the only way I can deal with it is by using humour HAHAHAHA SO FUNNY 
I	somewhere.	I don't want to, but I have plenty of reasons to.  I'm selfish, and don't deserve to be happy.  But deep down I want to be happy.  I want to be a good person. I'm 19 and trying to keep up with classes, work, and trying to obtain a healthy mindset but it's testing me.  I've also developed feelings for a coworker of the same age that I've known since mid highschool.  And I don't know if I should be ashamed of that or not.  I mean, she used to show interest when i started working with her, and still kinda does.  Maybe it's just me being desperate.  But it's all that's been on my mind lately. I just wanted to see if there is anyone on here in a similar situation as me I guess.  I know everyone has their fair share of bullshit in their lives but I needed to get my thoughts out somewhere. 
i enjoy drugs	they allow me to feel something different, im considering doing them more often	im stuck in this cycle.  i do the same things everyday.  i have no friends at all and i do not have the energy or desire to talk to new people, yet i find myself feeling quite lonely.  if this is all there is to my life i am going to kill myself.  i cannot continue like this.  i feel nothing whatsoever except for a dull buzzing feeling.  i feel like i am constantly on the verge of tears.  i am supposed to be on this path to getting into a good college, but i have no motivation to do well in school.  i feel like an empty shell, with no personality.  when people tell me that it is going to get better it does not help.   <e1> i enjoy drugs </e1>  because  <e2> they allow me to feel something different, im considering doing them more often </e2> .  getting a real dealer and stuff.  i just need a change but i have no will to change anything for myself.  sometimes i wish something really truely horrible would happen so the cycle would be broken.  so yeah if you have any suggestions or insight that'd be cool.  im just so stuck. 
I'm collecting a good paycheck	I don't want to leave and I might consider seeing a therapist again and want to keep my insurance	When I'm at work (software engineer), I feel okay.  I'm challenged, solving problems, working with lots of engaged people.  When I'm home, I remember I have nothing really to live for.   <e1> I'm collecting a good paycheck </e1> , which is why  <e2> I don't want to leave and I might consider seeing a therapist again and want to keep my insurance </e2> .  But still, I really want to quit my job despite totally feeling okay at work.  It's really funny when I think about it.  But I feel that in order for me to find a fulfilling life, I still need to quit my job.  I'm mostly depressed about not having a girlfriend (r/foreveralone), and having to do the same thing over every day (go to work, come back, watch videos, try to get pumped about going to the gym, whatever. . . . ), when all I want to do. . . . . . is have hot sex with a beautiful girl :( 
I have it all together	i'm able to function so well	I don't know too many people like me, who are diagnosed with depression ; anxiety but are very high functioning individuals.  i. e.  -&gt; I have a wonderful stable job which I am good at ; love, an amazing significant other, good friends, independence, I'm very responsible. . .  but I'm still incredibly depressed and riddled with anxiety attacks.  Its very easy for me to fool people that  <e1> I have it all together </e1>  because  <e2> i'm able to function so well </e2> , and the cover of everything going well in life is enough to not draw attention.  Anyone else like this?? 
the sad part is, I'm not experiencing a loss	I never had anything to lose	I went NC 5 months ago with my Nmom, Ndad and GC brother.  I've been working on unpacking the 20+years of baggage they left me with and my therapist made this comment and when I really thought about it, she's right.  I am not experiencing NC as a loss, at all.  But  <e1> the sad part is, I'm not experiencing a loss </e1>  because  <e2> I never had anything to lose </e2> .  I never had a real mom or a real dad or a real family.  They never took care of me, and there wasn't a single time in my entire life that I was their number 1 focus or priority.  Self esteem and security are generally built on the foundation laid by your parents, but what if I don't have one? How long will it take to be able to feel safe and secure and wanted in a relationship without having to rely on constant overt support and comfort? 
Hello	sanity?	Hello Reddit! So currently my sister has been facing a really bad panic attack.  It's been going on for almost 24 hours and I don't think she's improving.  She's not getting worse, but not better.  I have anxiety as well and have faced a number of panic attacks, however mine are different.  Usually I'm quiet and curl up in a ball while I ride it out.  I don't know how to help her.  Her's is sort of draining me.  Her emotions are constantly up and down and she can't sit still.  When she talks, she rambles nonsense or goes hysterical.  I'm so tired and I don't feel like I'm helping her.  I want to help but I also want some space to keep my emotions in check too (double panic attacks would be horrible!).  What can I do to help but also keep my sanity?
I started working out more and stuff and women, in general, attempt to engage with me a little more often and I get extremely nervous	I don't know how to act like the attractive guys they meet	I read something on here and it got me thinking. . . am I even attractive? Ever since high school, I based that answer strictly off of how other people saw me/reacted to me and how attractive I thought those people were. . . I've had girlfriends and just casual sex partners that some a lot of people wouldn't consider attractive to some that were even models.  These variety of women that I seem to involve myself with seem to just confuse who I am even more.  I'm a guy, I'm 21,  <e1> I started working out more and stuff and women, in general, attempt to engage with me a little more often and I get extremely nervous </e1>  because  <e2> I don't know how to act like the attractive guys they meet </e2> .  A lot of people tell me I'm handsome or some shit like that which sounds nice but then I think about the times someone made fun of me which brings me back to not even knowing how I look to other people? This is a stupid post
28	me	28 y/o female here with a narcissistic adoptive mother.  Six months ago I decided to go NC with my nmom after finding this sub and realizing that the physical, verbal, and emotional abuse my nmom put me through wasn't my fault.  nI started therapy for the first time in my life a month ago and was diagnosed with PTSD, and panic disorder.  Things have somewhat improved in my life since I went NC, but I still can't talk about my past. nI was the scape goat.  My adoptive mom always told me that I should just be glad she didn't leave me in the gutter.  She was constantly telling me how difficult I was from the time she first adopted me
If been seeing a psychologist who wouldn't entertain the thought of me having ADHD	I am in university	I just finished an preliminary assessment with a doctor who works closely with a psychiatrist.  She said I have ADHD PI and anxiety as a result.  I'm so happy that there's a conclusion to this.   <e1> If been seeing a psychologist who wouldn't entertain the thought of me having ADHD </e1>  because  <e2> I am in university </e2> .  I knew there was something wrong when I was able to resonate so well with a huge number of posts here. I finally feel like there is a light that is not too distant.  I just hope the treatment options agree with me.  Woo!TL;DR: I finally feel happy about my future for the first time in a long time.  Here's hoping it all goes well. 
I've	ugh	I've been having an ongoing panic attack for what seems like forever.  I'm so tired but I'm afraid to go to sleep and my anxiety is not helping! I just really wish I had someone who knows what this feels like to talk to. . . ugh
my laptop that I'd need to take to work today. So I started gathering things up from my bags and carted them downstairs to be put back in their places in my toolbag and laptop bag.   Except I forgot my laptop bag was upstairs, so i had to run back up and grab it.   Then I realized I'd forgotten my phone, so I ran back up stairs to grab it.   Then I realized I'd forgotten to grab something else, so I went and grabbed it as well.   Can't even remember what that was at this point	I was getting frustrated	This morning I got up and did a heavy bag workout, relaxed a little, then started getting ready for work.   I had been on a trip last week and had forgotten/neglected to unpack several things like  <e1> my laptop that I'd need to take to work today.

Yo!	X	Yo! I'm on day 40 and adding this sub to my homepage has just made this process so much easier and I just wanted to contribute, and say thanks to the community.  Everyone, day 1, or day 1001, you've made the BEST fucking decision you ever will, and I'm super proud of you all!! KEEP AT IT YOU BEAUTIES! X
Why	worse?	Why are drugs looked down upon in this sub? I mean for some people here life couldn't really get any worse so what's the point in avoiding dependency by avoiding drugs if your life can't get worse? 
I'm	it.	I'm so overwhelmed and tired and angry and sad and there's so much going on in my head that I have quite literally thought about ending it multiple times today and I just need ways to feel a little better.  I dont have the money for a therapist, I have no friends to talk to, and very few people would miss me if I went through with it. 
Even if you only have a week clean I'd like to hear from you too	that's way longer than i can do	Hope this is allowed but just looking for some people to pm with me.  Preferably people that went to dozens of treatments over lots of years.   People that lost everything and still couldn't quit.  I'm proud of you first timers but would love some pms from people that just couldn't figure it out and then one dah clicked.   <e1> Even if you only have a week clean I'd like to hear from you too </e1>  because  <e2> that's way longer than i can do </e2> .  I feel like I'm at the breaking point where i get clean or give up
Between playing long games of phone tag, psychiatrists suddenly deciding they're not accepting new clients, others flat out saying they don't want to deal with ADHD (college town, possible med abuse), and finding out one psychiatrist DOESN'T EVEN EXIST	this whole process if frickin frustrating	 <e1> Between playing long games of phone tag, psychiatrists suddenly deciding they're not accepting new clients, others flat out saying they don't want to deal with ADHD (college town, possible med abuse), and finding out one psychiatrist DOESN'T EVEN EXIST </e1> ,  <e2> this whole process if frickin frustrating </e2> . I hate ADHD.  I know what I have to do.  I just.  can't.  do it. 
Honestly,	input.	Honestly, I searched all over reddit and google, but found very few tangible results.  I know it's different for everybody, but I'd like to know tangible first hand accounts of what people did in response to being emotionally blunted/zombie/robot/depressed/socially withdrawn from taking Adderall.  What specifically, anecdotally, worked for you? Please feel free to leave input if a different medication blunted you, for which you found a remedy.  I'm personally interested in the solutions found by people who reacted similarly to Adderall. Yes, I understand different medications work for different people; I'm merely asking for anecdotal solutions specific to the situation. Furthermore, I came across a lot of people in my searches that believed that emotional blunting was a feature or benefit.  This is completely subjective, but in my opinion, emotional blunting is not acceptable.  You do not take medication to be less of a human. Sorry, I'm just very frustrated with my experiences with Adderall and need an immediate change.  And I'd like to know possible solutions to discuss with my psychiatrist.  I greatly appreciate all input. 
Edit:	call.	Edit: This is not just about the coupons I just got off the phone with them.  I was afraid I wouldn't qualify but it turns out that I do.  They require proof of income, dependants (if applicable), and cost of the medication with insurance.  Also, and I might be wrong on this, I believe the assistance is only available if the medication costs $ 50 or more for you out of pocket after insurance and any applicable discounts. Link:  shire. com/patients/patient-services/shire-caresIf you aren't sure about any of it or if you have any questions I encourage you to give them a call. 
makes me feel worse	now I'm thinking they hate me etc	On my own again while my boyfriend is working away and I'm doing okay, I had a couple days in bed when he first left, the second one because my friends were supposed to come for dinner and they rearranged for today.  They are supposed to be here in half an hour and I have already cooked (I like to be organised!) and they have cancelled a second time.  The reason they gave me is fine and I know it isn't their fault but I can't help but feel so rejected and alone.  They made no mention of rearranging this time as well which  <e1> makes me feel worse </e1>  as  <e2> now I'm thinking they hate me etc </e2>  (which I know logically isn't true but that's borderline thinking to a t right?!) I am now sat here feeling numb and dejected and trying not to let that interfere with my behaviour.  Fuck. 
Is	experience?	Is going  a million miles a second thinking about anything and everything and especially all the bad thoughts you've ever had.  Alll the bad times in your life. This will happen to me randomly.   It happened last night.  I wasn't even feeling sad i was just fine.  Surprisingly.  nI got home from hanging out with my brother and then when i crawled into bed my mind just went crazy and i started freaking out then cried a bit. Anyone else have a similar experience?
Ive	it	Ive been depressed for a very long time.  It gets to a point where i think understand what depres fuck it
I	differ?	I just found this sub-reddit and I'm so happy I did.  I've been trying to quit for a year, a few months really actively.  I need to make it happen to live my life.   I'm just wondering how many other ladies are on this sub-reddit and if /how being a woman makes our stories differ?
I have come here	the fact I don't know the answers to my situation	 <e1> I have come here </e1>  due to  <e2> the fact I don't know the answers to my situation </e2> .  To make a long story short, I have known this guy since I was 17, I am now 26.  Ironically, he used to be married to my former best friend.  My friendship with her ended around the same time as their divorce about 3 years ago.  She went crazy, ran off with another man and got pregnant, blah blah.  He and I have remained great friends, and even hung out.  We talk often.  Back in July he told me he had fallen in love with me and he was always afraid to say it, that I would leave him in the friend zone or what my reaction would be since of course
I'm absolutely stuck and despite seeking professional help. . . . I can't enjoy my day-to-day interactions anymore with people	I am a shell of who I was	nI feel like I am going insane.  I used to be so naturally creative.  People would start talking and I would instantly have interesting and funny conversational tangents I would want to go on and explore.  It's gone.  I'm living with my best friend, and when we talk, it's not the same.  My brain is tapped out creatively.  I think no original thoughts.  I'm absolutely miserable.  Not to mention the fact that I feel like I have no life purpose and nothing excites me.  I am DESPERATE for my old way of being back.  Life doesn't feel worth living otherwise. Does anyone relate to this?  <e1> I'm absolutely stuck and despite seeking professional help. . . . I can't enjoy my day-to-day interactions anymore with people </e1>  because  <e2> I am a shell of who I was </e2> .  I hate myself.  I wish I had an answer.  I'm so confused by all of this. I really appreciate any and all guidance. PS.  This article very accurately describes what I'm going through:  experienceproject. com/stories/Lost-Myself-Somewhere-Along-The-Way/3405114n
she is taking me to a therapist	she has some understanding	I want to open up to my mom about my anxiety, I feel like she doesn't understand how much it's affecting me.  I mean,  <e1> she is taking me to a therapist </e1> , so  <e2> she has some understanding </e2> .  But I just don't know.  I wanna go out to dinner with her and just hang out but I got my period this morning and had horrible cramps.  I took ibuprofen and chances are it'll wear off soon.  
Shit	no	Shit post warning.  I am overwhelmed.  I am stressed.  I would be satisfied if no
Granted I'm always studying	I'm sure that's a part of it	I searched through this subreddit and have noticed that I do not seem to be the only one who is experiencing chronic tiredness despite enough sleep, but most people commenting have said their medication helps. Well, I have been consistently medicated for almost a year now (with a 3 month break) and I am still EXHAUSTED.  I sleep 7-9 hours/night.  I take naps.  I drink coffee.  I'm so so so tired all the time.  Cause-Effect((e1,e2)) <e1> Granted I'm always studying </e1> , so  <e2> I'm sure that's a part of it </e2> , but I'm SO tired and I'd really like to figure this out.  I'm currently on methylphenidate (generic Ritalin) 10-20mg and it helps my concentration somewhat but I still get distracted (probably due to lack of discipline).  I'm also taking Concerta, if anyone's had experience with that. I have a doctor appointment next week and I'm going to bring this up but doctors keep dismissing my concerns, saying that I'm in school and of course I'll be tired : I swear this isn't a normal level of daytime sleepiness, especially for how much I sleep each night! Would love any insight any of you have. n
When	experience?	When I went on stimulants, I was told it would aggravate my anxiety.  Instead, I'm the least anxious I've been in my whole life.  The only problem I had was coming down from the meds, but after a small afternoons dose, that anxiety is gone too.  nHad anybody else had this experience? 
I have a close friend, a man who is 35.  He's been having very strange and somewhat concerning thought patterns over the last year and I'm curious if this could just be a weird phase or the start of something more serious	I should push him to get help soon	 <e1> I have a close friend, a man who is 35.  He's been having very strange and somewhat concerning thought patterns over the last year and I'm curious if this could just be a weird phase or the start of something more serious </e1>  that  <e2> I should push him to get help soon </e2> .  He started a new, very stressful job around the year ago mark.  Here is a summary of the behaviors:  - He believes he can see the future for other people (but not himself) by listening to spirits, usually of lost friends/family of that person, guiding that person.  He tells me that he physically hears the spirits talk to him and sometimes they flash images of things in his head to send their message in cryptic, metaphorical ways.   - When he is wrong about a wrong prediction, as is usually the case, he always says I know I am right
I	be/Hu0xlyLwK7Q	I love Me by The 1975.  I probably shouldn't listen to sad songs but when I do I feel such an emotional connection.  Any of you guys also like sad songs? be/Hu0xlyLwK7Q
Even when I write them down in a journal. And it's so silly	there's times where it takes me a long time to realize how stupid I was	I always make things more complex than they have to be.  If a test is coming up in a month, I tend to reject a tutor or don't even think to buy a study book, until it's one week before the test. Then I start realizing that getting a tutor would have been smart or that I actually did not the study book. But it's not just arrogance. I tend to forget about important things when they are not coming up for like a month or so. Then I start panicking about them and how I'm late.  <e1> Even when I write them down in a journal. And it's so silly </e1>  because  <e2> there's times where it takes me a long time to realize how stupid I was </e2> .

Hey	Thanks!	Hey all, I'm new to the sub.  Long story short, I've been dealing with anger management my whole life.  I just thought I would ask on here who all has some good strategies for venting your anger? I'm not looking for ways to calm down, meditation, that kind of stuff.  I mean real ways to let your anger out that don't hurt those around you.  Thanks!
I went through a humiliating experience where I cried in front of my manager.  She simply pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay	I'd been quiet recently and I just collapsed emotionally	Hi everyone Today  <e1> I went through a humiliating experience where I cried in front of my manager.  She simply pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay </e1>  because  <e2> I'd been quiet recently and I just collapsed emotionally </e2> .  I really fell apart.  I broke up with my girlfriend last week and I'm still incredibly raw over it.  I keep thinking about her and the pain I've caused.  She wanted to stay with me and understand what I was going through but I just pushed her away.  I sit constantly thinking did I make the right decision.  And then today I just fell to pieces and I'm so embarrassed by it.  I feel so low. 
My latest fear is particularly freaking me out	I recently found out my phone was hacked	Okay, so first of all, there always seems to be something new I'm afraid of.  Like I can't remember the last time I just was living calmly, worry-free.   <e1> My latest fear is particularly freaking me out </e1> . . .  <e2> I recently found out my phone was hacked </e2> .  Ok, I changed my passwords got it resolved no problems there.  The issue is that I had a picture of my apartment key in my photos.  So basically, I'm worried that whoever hacked my phone now could potentially make a copy of my key and break into my home.  Writing it down it sounds kinda ridiculous now but I just can't shake this fear.  I'm generally always afraid of someone breaking in, in general but given all of this it makes me even more anxious. Ease my  mind?
They think he could have cancer or something sinister brewing	its really depressed the hell out of me	My cat, hes 15 and pretty much feel like hes my only friend (family really can't see why i'm so attached to him when hes not the worlds more affectionate cat (they take after their owners right?)) by all accounts is perfectly healthy and looks acts like it, except his blood tests keep coming back with liver problems (everything else in him returns normal great for his age) regardless of what they do.   <e1> They think he could have cancer or something sinister brewing </e1>  and  <e2> its really depressed the hell out of me </e2> , when the vet rang (today) it was like someone let the air out of the world.  Everything around instantly became duller, like a dark fog rolled in.  I was mid dinner when the phone rang, i didn't eat after the call. Now i have to decide whether to keep on probing him (ultrasound guided biopsy would be next) and keep throwing money at the vets (financial woes weighing in even more) or to leave him be and see what happens (i know i'd kick my self even more if i left him for 6 months
I'm proud of myself but also scared	I know how easy it is to fall back into old habits	So easy to think that life will be better once I've quit. . .  Whilst sitting there with a doob in my hand.  So hard to hold onto that feeling once the withdrawals kick in.  This has been a hell of a long week but I made it a week, cold turkey.   <e1> I'm proud of myself but also scared </e1>  because  <e2> I know how easy it is to fall back into old habits </e2>  and I do NOT want to go through this again.  I have quit more times than I can remember during my 15 year habit.  Normally I cave by this point.  Just holding on to the memory of how good things were when I made a quit last longer than a month.  That's where I want to be again.  I don't want to do this withdrawal shit ever again - it takes more of a toll on my body each time.  That's all really - just wanted to share that.  Wishing all my fellow quitters the best of luck.  The strength is within you and if you're not feeling it, then you just haven't found it yet.  The journey continues. . . !

I'm somehow fucking it up	I don't deserve any of this	Someone please help.  I know this is a stupid dilemma but I'm angry and sad and I don't know who to talk to.  I've never dated people only just hookups and such-and now someone has interest in me and I like him the same and everything is working out but  <e1> I'm somehow fucking it up </e1>  because  <e2> I don't deserve any of this </e2> .  I've been raised that my job in life is to be a battery-my purpose is to help people.  I don't need or deserve love and i shouldn't take notice by others.  And now that someone has noticed me and pursues me I've just had the worst anxiety and confusion about everything and I can't sleep and eating is weird and I'm just exhausted with being so fucked up and incapable of letting myself be happy and accepting love and complimentsnI don't even know what this post is getting at nI'm just a mess right now 
Why	others?	Why do i do this? When i get angry, i will sstat hitting myself on the arm, my head, my leg.  I dont know why, but i just go into a frenzy, any advice on how to calm down and stop myself from hurting myself and potentially others?
I	n	I was on 120mg daily of aderall xr + 40mg ir twice a day.  I am wondering what the equality of mg would be in this be prescription.  Any ideas? I want to make sure this new dr.

I'm	come.	I'm not proud of how many times I've (stupidly) gone back to drinking in the 3 or 4 months since I first posted here.  However, if there's one thing I'm sure of it's that this is the most kind and supportive group of people on the Internet. I'm glad to be back.  I'm lucky that my life has not taken any truly significant hits in my time away, and I'm hoping you'll welcome me back.  Thank you all so much.  Badge reset requested.  Let's do this! Sober weekend, here I come. 
I make a lot of jokes about killing myself, and me dying	help cope with my serious suicidal thoughts	 <e1> I make a lot of jokes about killing myself, and me dying </e1> .  I mean A LOT of jokes about it.  Like it's become my new sense of humor, and somewhat of a coping method, but it feels wrong of me to try and trivialize it.  Whenever anyone asks about why I make so many jokes about it, I tell them that it's ironic humor in order to  <e2> help cope with my serious suicidal thoughts </e2>  instead of getting professional help because I'm a pussy.  They ignore them most of the time after that. Is it wrong to do that, or is it okay?
I	effect?	I started generic Adderall XR 10 mg last week, and I've only taken one so far. .  This was due feeling pretty nauseous the day/night I took it, and the morning after.  After snooping around, that seems to be one of the 'normal' side effects of Adderall.  Also, it made me hot, then I was pretty cold during the come down.  I also kept waking up throughout the night, which I also see is 'normal'. Another thing that I've noticed that I haven't seen much about is a slightly sore stomach. .  Not like the whole belly, but just the stomach on the left side.  It's not painful, just mildly irritated/sore.  I experienced this for about two days after taking Adderall.  Anyone else experience this? Is this another 'normal' side effect?
I haven't eaten in 8 hours	I'm really angry right now	I got pissed at a game.  Then BOOM, platter dead.   <e1> I haven't eaten in 8 hours </e1> .   <e2> I'm really angry right now </e2> .  Being hungry makes you pissed. 
I've	it.	I've had social anxiety for 7 years now and have actively tried to fix it the last 3.  I have studied a lot about it online and gone about conducting my own gradual exposure therapy to fix it.  I have come a long way from where I was but sometimes I get days where I say or do something awkward in a social situation and it's all it takes to ruin my whole week.  I sit at home obsessing for hours what it is that makes me so different from everyone else and if I'm ever going to catch up to 'normal' people.  Anyone here ever made it out of SA? I feel like the mental and emotional damage we pick up from being alone for so long is so severe we never truly heal and best we can do is get better at coping with it. 
I am not sure	I don't know a lot about the disorder	My father is a diagnosed narcissist; however, as I browse this sub, I realize that my mother may be too.   <e1> I am not sure </e1>  since  <e2> I don't know a lot about the disorder </e2> .  Maybe you can weigh in on whether or not this sounds like a narcissist.  So, every time I try to open up to her about something difficult in my life, such as being a new stepmother- she says, That's nothing.  I had two kids when I was your age.  I laughed about putting a McChicken sandwich in my pocket when I was drunk
But	together.	But I don't think anyone knows.  Its so hard to get people to realize my entire brain can't stop thinking and that I am completely miserable 100% of the time.  If its not one thing I'm worrying about its another and my brain refuses to stop but somehow I can stand in line in Chipotle or make a Target run but I am absolutely going insane most of that time.  Things are getting really bad, I'm 32 and absolutely want to die.  This is not the first time I've felt this but I can't seem to get it together.  
Sucks	sometimes I feel as though sleep is the one SURE escape	 <e1> Sucks </e1>  because  <e2> sometimes I feel as though sleep is the one SURE escape </e2> , amirite? I'm trying to do deep breathind and mind quieting techniques but I am just so sad it is almost physically painful.  I feel so alone.  I feel like this every single night! Yeesh.  I want to develop more non-superficial connections with people but I hate expressing my feelings irl.  What I wouldn't give for a boyfriend, or even a platonic friend that would hold me and speak to me.  
I	relate?	I mean sure, it's a given that your OCD will act up some more after stress, but the tics on the otherhand? When I get really stressed out, I get the urge to keep on shaking my head up and down in a really subtle but not so subtle way.  The urge is sometimes there, but it's just worsened when I'm stressed out.  Can anyone relate?
New	this?Thanks	New doctor and was just diagnosed with anxiety with minor OCD.  I never took medications for any long term issue before but have a history with anxiety attacks.  I haven't felt depressed since I was much younger.  After researching the drug this evening, I pretty much saw that Lexapro helps with depression and not so much with anxiety.  Am I taking the right drug? Anyone know much about this?Thanks
I	away	I literally wake up every morning with sore muscles from being tense all night.  Except for stress from school, my life is great.  I have an awesome support system and I'm taking classes I love.  Some days my worry is excessive/intrusive. .  and I don't even know what's triggering me.  I just feel in a permanent state of stress.  Feeling super overwhelmed and want it to go away 
Hello.	this	Hello.  nThis Sunday is probably the most important day of my life and career.  nAnd I have worked hard (I've been on medication)  and my preparation is pretty good too.  nbut deep inside a voice keeps on saying i am going to bomb,  i won't be able to make it and will make impulsive decisions while answering like I've done my entire life.   nhow can i overcome this 
Today	ruined.	Today I managed to ignore a huge orange wet cement sign and walked right into some wet cement.  How can I be so distracted to not notice something like that? Now my shoes are ruined. 
Does	Thanks	Does anyone have any tips on how to calm yourself down when you're having a panic attack? I've tried breathing deeply but it doesn't always work.  Need something I could easily do at my desk at work also.  Thanks 
I	5.	I am 24 years old.  Still in undergrad and bouncing from school to school.  My biggest problem is just starting my work.  I'm so mentally drained and I have put in zero effort this semester.  I'm failing all my classes and likely won't be accepted into university to finish my degree.  I honestly do not know how you guys managed to get through this.  This is my 7th year and I don't know if I can keep going.  I admit I haven't sought the proper help.  I am on meds.  But even just asking for help gives me incredible anxiety.  I've emailed my professors asking to meet with me but after 24 hours I only received 1 reply out of 5. 
This	all.	This is my first post in this thread.  So a little background about me.  I've had anxiety all my life and I've delt with years of depression.  Anyways, as of recently, I've started to develop this weird tense feeling in my chest which when it first happened for the first couple of times caused me to have major panic attacks.  My anxiety has never caused any heart issues, only ever just constant worry and stress.  Should I see a doctor? I feel like I get even more anxious thinking about seeing a doctor incase the heart problem is something much more at large rather than just anxiety.  I just really want to be happy.  Everyday I just am so sluggish.  This tense feeling causes me to do nothing.  I want medication but I'm terrified of it.  I have smoked weed which seems to REALLY help but I get anxious about the possible development of schitzophrenia.  I guess I just need some reassurance from someone or something.  I want to murder my anxiety once and for all.  
I	garbage.	I feel like I'm stuck.  My son's father constantly puts me down and screams at me.  I feel lower than dirt and he makes me wanna just kill myself, take the easy way out.  The only thing that keeps me from going through with it is my 5 year old son.  He needs me and loves me so much.  Also, my mother has lost a child before.  The thought of putting her through that pain again kills me.  In the back of my head I tell myself things will get easier for them over time.  I know suicide is selfish but I hate myself and apparently I'm just garbage.  
The	Love,	The sort of frenetic  chaotic  stream of consciousness quality of it resonates with me so goddamn much it hurts.  lol It's kind of a cathartic experience too; I feel so much of my pain and struggle lifted within the duration of a song or an album.  Music has truly changed my life.  I'm studying it at university.  Whether that was a good choice of mine is up for debate, but let's open the floor up for some discussion.  nHere's a link to my favorite album of theirs for those who aren't in the know:[ youtube. com/watch?v=pSlQDEyN0P8;list=PLD98FD7EE927B844F]( youtube. com/watch?v=pSlQDEyN0P8;list=PLD98FD7EE927B844F)nIf any of you guys are into this type of stuff, a good friend of mine and myself have been trying to get a band started for about a year now.  I play guitar, and I'm living in Tulsa Oklahoma.  Drop a line!Much Love,
I	Thanks!	I finally passed my driving test after 2 failed attempts, it was rough BUT I'm nervous to start driving by myself.  Any way to conquer this anxiety? Thanks! 
I am freaking out	I legitimately do not think I have gotten a 100% on a test in 4 or 5 years.	Holy shit,   <e1> I am freaking out  </e1>  and needed to tell someone.  I'm a sophomore in college and a few weeks ago was midterms.  I've been dealing with ADHD for a long time now, since I was 10 or so, so I knew it would be hard, it was nothing new. With the help of the Pomodoro Technique as well as all the willpower I could muster to not get distracted and play video games, I studied my ass off and crushed my exams! a 75%, 86%, and a big whopping 100%! It felt so surreal to get a 100%,    <e2> I legitimately do not think I have gotten a 100% on a test in 4 or 5 years.  </e2>   This was mostly an off my chest post
I was hitting him and and that I had turned into a completely different person.	I felt so guilty and apologized.	There's a lot of details.  I tried to write everything I know, and everything leading up to it but it was 2,000 words.  Long story short I had blacked out sex with a married coworker two nights ago.  I am 24, he is 37.  I was drinking, he offered to take me home.  I woke up yesterday embarrassed at how I must have acted.  He informed me at work that he had to physically pick me up and take me to the car.  He told me  <e1> I was hitting him and and that I had turned into a completely different person.  </e1>    <e2> I felt so guilty and apologized.  </e2>  Then he tells me a few hours later that we had sex.  He claimed he didn't think I was that drunk
After	know.	After the debaucle in my previous post I came home to realize my DDW RT wasn't functional.  My VPN was down as was my encrypted connection. The backups I have aren't restoring and my VPN isn't allowing me to login upon rebuild or masking anything. I am so fucking terrified right now.  This is punishment from the Computer Gods I swear.  It is all too coincidental not to be.  I have no idea how to appease them or anything. I might just put everything in the microwave.  I just want my infrastructure back.  I want my secure connection back. I swear they're punishing me and this will be another 3 am shitshow. I can't deal with this my computer and network security are my life.  But now they see all and know all.  I don't even know. 
This is a particular issue	I'm working on a phD and I'm mostly accountable to myself (I set my own schedule and work on my own project)	I have a lot of stress at work.   Im a perfectionist and my job is demanding and I have been trying to cut down on how urgent I perceive things to help keep me from being stressed out all the time.   However,  'm finding that I have a hard time motivating myself if I don't see things as life or death or that I'll half-ass things if they don't have to be perfect.    <e1> This is a particular issue </e1>  because  <e2> I'm working on a phD and I'm mostly accountable to myself (I set my own schedule and work on my own project) </e2>  Do you have any strategies for getting things done without excessive stress?(I am on medication, but I still have a hard time getting engaged with my work if I don't tell myself it's really important that this thing is done right now)
Hey	already.	Hey everybody.  I'm extremely lucky in that I get to finally see a therapist and a psychiatrist and get help with my issues.  I'm just so sick of putting in the work to get/feel better.  I'm sick of either feeling anxious and scared and angry or completely depressed.  No matter how hard I try every day my emotions are out of my control and it all comes down to my neurochemistry instead of my actions.  I don't want to die, but I want to lay in bed and not exist anymore.  Thank you for listening to my rant.  I'm sorry the the negativity, I know there's a lot of that in our lives already.  
Hi,	care.	Hi, I've been having anxiety for a long time and it has consumed my life.  I want to get better but my family ignores it and gets angry whenever I talk about it.  I'm tired of suffering and I'm ready to seek medical treatment for it.  I wanted to know what steps I should take, and whether I have to visit a therapist first.  Your help would be much appreciated.  Thank you, take care.  
being constantly worried/depressed/angry	lack of responses	It's like an insane addiction.  Either I'm in bed or I'm trying to get a connection.  This is either through movies/videos (where I connect with the people in them) or, the troublesome one, nonstop virtual communication.  I NEED to text, I can't get fucking enough of it! I'll often go through my contacts list and send random things to girls to try and get any kind of conversation started.  And this leads to insane clinginess.  One option is fucking bored as hell.  The other option is the emotional distress of thinking that I'm annoying someone, and  <e1> being constantly worried/depressed/angry </e1>  about  <e2> lack of responses </e2> .  Then there is the Reddit posting addiction.  
I forgot how to act like myself with other people	I always blank out	One of my problems is getting to the core of why I'm the way I am.  For me all I can really say is I was a really shy kid and always kind of felt inferior or like not good enough if people never initiated things with me.  Then as a teen, after trying to always fit in with different groups of people,  <e1> I forgot how to act like myself with other people </e1> .   So now  <e2> I always blank out </e2>  and overthink how I come across to people in order to be liked and have approval.  Just like being yourself should be instinctive, i feel like not being myself is instinctive.  What are your stories? It could help give me and others a better understanding of how this disease works 
Especially	fails.	Especially when I'm agitated and I've been getting irritated lately.  Not only that its like i feel like im not supposed to feel bad emotion or else ill hurt someone.  With ocd sometimes intrusive thoughts feel so real.  Especially with the images.   I've been having dreams affected by these thoughts too so i start thinking is that a precognition [magical thinking] from one obsession to another.  It never fails. 
Honestly,	week	Honestly,  I tought the first few days would have been hard,  and they have,  but also that it would start to become easier after a week.  I still crave it,  I still want it,  I still think why keep going? You quit cold for a whole week
Still	strong.	Still having some denial that my relationship with my bipolar ex is over.  It's been 3 months since any contact (my choice).  He broke up with me during his first manic episode, and did and said a lot of things that many would probably consider unforgivable.  But I really loved him and miss him.  The only thing keeping me from reaching out is self respect and knowing my family would be disappointed. It's so hard to imagine I can find someone I loved as much as him, that I enjoyed being around no matter what (he was undiagnosed prior to episode).  Has anyone successfully moved on, and found a healthier, happier relationship? I'm looking into a future of uncertainty and finding it difficult to stay strong.  
I	anymore.	I still love her, with every fiber of my being.  I'm still in love with her, which makes it all hurt so much more.  But she's not backing down.  She refuses to acknowledge any of the things i point out as being possible factors or proof she is manic.  She defends it as she is medicated.  Yes, but heavy stress and lack of sleep can mess with the effectiveness of meds.  She refuses to acknowledge when i say that.  She refuses to acknowledge the depression that hits her hard. So i must move on.  Whether i want to or not.  She says she's in love with this guy.  She refuses to see how irrational her behavior is.  She's known him less than a month and said she wants to move with him (he's taking a job actoss the country).  How can she not see how irrational,  how impulsive that is.  She isn't,  but she wants to.  So I have no choice but to move on.  To be the best dad I can for my kids.  I hope one day she sees what i see, but i don't hold out hope.  Not anymore.  
I've always had a soft spot for the homeless and ALWAYS help in some way or another	I decided to go through the drive-thru to purchase some Double Cheeseburgers for the man	So, last week I was on my way to Starbucks just down the street from my house when I noticed an elderly homeless man just outside the McDonald's nearby said Starbucks with a sign that read, homeless &amp; hungry; anything helps.   <e1> I've always had a soft spot for the homeless and ALWAYS help in some way or another </e1> .    <e2> I decided to go through the drive-thru to purchase some Double Cheeseburgers for the man </e2> .

I	staff?	I live in the UK.  I want to go to some doctors asap to treat my depression, however I do wonder what would happen if I was completely honest about my thoughts.  I don't want to end up taking mandatory treatment or leave, or it to have long lasting effects on my life (e. g.  a record of it somewhere that may prevent me from doing certain things)Likewise, the consequences of talking about this with university or work staff?
I really was mad at myself and hopeless after slipping up after 150 days of not drinking	Just so upset to reset my badge and start all over again	  <e1> I really was mad at myself and hopeless after slipping up after 150 days of not drinking </e1> .    <e2> Just so upset to reset my badge and start all over again </e2> .  I felt like I threw it all away but I know that's not the case.  Beyond thrilled to have made it 60 days and to be rocking a 2 month star.  To anyone out there that's relapsed, don't stress and hate yourself over it.  Just jump back on the wagon sooner than later you'll begin to notice numbers racking up again.  I'm in a good place and looking forward to seeing my number keep rising.  Much love to all of you sobernauts here on SD!
I	lost?	I know the euphoria goes away after a while (I'm still not sure if it's even euphoria and not just me loving having a clear mind) but does the ability to read a piece of text or write something down without your mind jumping into a million different tangents ever get lost?
Writting	fun	Writting from my phone sorry for the typos. So i am a person that gets angry easily.  It's never real anger, it just that i expose most of my emotions through anger.  It passes quickly, goes by and 20 minutes later it is no longer there.  I have two major problems i want to adress and i dont know how to.  My first problem is with arguing and my second is with forgiving and forgettig. ________However sometimes i get really angry.  It is usually for an actual reason, but my problem lies in arguing with people. (Not sure if to argue is the correct word in english; not my 1st language and such; i mean to agressively and loudly speak with someone.  In spanish it is discutir)I have two types of arguments.  One where it's just for fun
Hi	interesting	Hi everybody, not really a question but I'm sure some of you can relate.  These emotions keep cropping up by the end of the week and it really sucks to be honest.  My mind goes back to normal on Monday but during the weekend it acts really strange and I have no idea what to do. I tend to get really bored and browse endlessly on the internet, which is really bad.  I do try to exercise but on rest days I feel like shit. It seems I'm only happy if I'm socializing with people or it's in the beginning of the week - I know it's really weird.  Sometimes I prefer alone time but most of that alone time is me procrastinating and wasting time, ugh. Can anyone relate? Psychiatrist wasn't convinced that it was Bipolar Disorder but I had to fill my void with something interesting
frustrated	While the medication has helped to alleviate my symptoms, it's also had some very unwanted side effects	I'm beyond  <e1> frustrated </e1>  ! I've been on Zoloft off and on since 2011 for the treatment of GAD and Clinical Depression.    <e2> While the medication has helped to alleviate my symptoms, it's also had some very unwanted side effects </e2> .  It is wrecking my health.  My weight has gone from ~180 - 210.  I'm tired **all the time**.  My attention span is very short compared to what it was.  I'm apathetic about . . . everything.  What's worse? Walking around in a fog or feeling depressed and anxious.  I'm not sure anymore.  I want to ask my doctor about reducing my medication or maybe trying a different medication during my next visit.  Have any of you had similar experiences? Any insight is appreciated.  
Soon after woke up	I felt him jump onto the couch behind me	I am feeling extremely guilty. I was really upset when I told my mentor what happened and then she got really upset and is really worried about me.  But I think I didn't accurately explain what happened and now I feel like I am blowing things way out of proportion and garnering sympathy when I don't deserve it.  I feel like a horrible person. I got too drunk Halloween weekend.  I crashed at a friend's place around 4:30am. Her guy friend who had been aggressive towards me the whole night (and previously) came back to crash too. I got on the couch and fell asleep almost instantly.   <e1> Soon after woke up </e1>  > because <   <e2> I felt him jump onto the couch behind me </e2> e.  Next thing I know he is pulling down my pants. I was too fucking drunk
I'll	medication.	I'll make this quick.  I've been having a terrible time with Anxiety to the point where I can't even go out and talk to people.  When it gets really bad, I almost can't handle it even in a calm environment with nobody around.  A friend of mine told me to use CBD oil for my anxiety - that it helps.  Anybody here ever try it? If so, what are the results? I just don't want to be put on any medication. 
Hi,	all?	Hi, all.  Asking this in this and r/anxiety.  Was on Zoloft for a year at 75 mg, started feeling like a zombie a bit (more spacey), my doc bumped me down to 50 mg.  Started feeling too much and crying, etc.  After about 6 weeks, she added 150 mg of Wellbutrin XL.  Been on that cocktail for a year.  Since then, I've gotten increasingly emotionally numb/blunted/blank.  No motivation, don't care to do anything, don't care that I almost ruined my marriage. I'm tapering off now.  I was wondering how long I can expect to wait before my emotions come back? Silly question, I guess, but I've read that it can take awhile or that there's a correlation with how long you were on the medication.  I've also read that in some cases, you never really return to how you were before the meds?Anyone had any experience with this at all?
disappointed	I didn't want to smoke anything ever again	I bought a giant black board and have been ticking off days nor smoking but last night I smoked 8 cigs,  which I bought from a shop.  On one hand I'm  <e1> disappointed </e1>  with myself as  <e2> I didn't want to smoke anything ever again </e2> .  But on the other hand I haven't smoked weed.  So my main objective is fine.  But I know it's a slippery slope and I don't even like cigarettes.  I've just gotten into a habit of smoking when gigging as band mates smoke and there often a lot of waiting around and smoking breaks it up.  I really want to tick of another day on the black board and can't face having to start again.  But I feel like if I don't it's cheating.  Has anyone else quit tobacco and weed at the same time? Not sure what to do.  
Tell	?	Tell us pool our collective experiences to figure out the best way to get more work done ! Tips I find usefull :   * 15 minute timers where I do a single task  * plan for the day + time table  * Not feeling guilty when I make a mistakes.  Rather than hating myself.  I logically see that this is neurological issue, and beating myself up for it is not going to help.    * Find rules that work , keep changing rules until I find something that works.    * Turn off the internet ! Thanks.  What are tricks that help you ? 
Hey	help	Hey guys, first poster here.  I've started taking Concerta about a month or so ago to help with focusing.  It works well and I feel a huge difference aside from some increased aggression  (not that important). The issue that I'm having though is that my hands and feet are freezing cold.  Like a fridge cadaver cold all the time.  This wouldn't be an issue if I weren't also sweating all the time from my armpits.  My right one seems to sweat more (idk why).  Has anyone else experienced having freezing cold appendages while also perspirating armpits?Is there anyway to combat this?TL;DR: Taking Concerta.  Having cold feet and hands while sweating from armpits.  Please help
sad	I like it better	I dont know its like even when I don't feel sad I try to feel  <e1> sad </e1>  because  <e2> I like it better </e2>  ??? Its like I like being sad maybe? Does anyone else have this issue?
I don't use Reddit much at all	awkward	  <e1> I don't use Reddit much at all </e1>  and this might seem  <e2> awkward </e2>   over the internet but, it breaks my heart to hear what some of the things that people go through.  I dont care how big or small your problems are if you ever need someone to be there to listen and talk to you im here for you.  
depressed	I find myself incapable of doing any homework	Just please give me some advice on how I can work on being happy again. I jumped out of a moving car yesterday. I've cried everyday for the past 2 weeks. I feel like I can't breathe all the time.  I'm usually very focused, and I always get my shit done one way or the other, but I've been so  <e1> depressed </e1>  lately,  <e2> I find myself incapable of doing any homework </e2>  .  My brain just won't work.  I feel like there's nothing I enjoy doing now. .  I've been fighting with my boyfriend more often as of lately, and I can't tell if it's just me and my anxiety, or if he actually just doesn't give a shit about me. . .  
Is	adhd.	Is anyone here on the diet? For those curious check out the subreddit 'keto' and search adhd.  
So	much.	So I recently moved to a new place and started a new job, I've been staying at several friends' houses while I looked for somewhere permenent.  During that time I've had a comparitively small amount of problems with ADHD (mainly just leaving stuff at their houses)  but today I finally moved to my own place and just. . . crashed.  I just flopped down on the bed and now I don't feel like doing anything - unpacking, getting ready for work tomorrow. . . I can't even be bothered to make the food I bought earlier.  Anyone had similair experiences to this? Being around other people really seems to help me but as soon as I'm alone it's like someone flicked the 'off' switch in my brain.  I'm supposed to be starting medication soon so I'm not *too* worried, just wanted to ask if this is normal, in case I'm just worrying too much. 
Why	end.	Why does depression have to suck so much.  I have a great life, yet I want to end it.  I'm so sick of being upset and sad all the time.  When will it end.  
Hey	genres.	Hey all.  I'm really big into music, and it's my go to thing to do when I'm depressed.  Just wondering, what do you all listen to? Here's some of my personal favorite songs to listen to while depressed - Wingnut Dishwashers Union - My Idea of FunGhost Mice - I Dare You To Live Forever Bomb The Music Industry! - Wednesday Night DrinkballJeff Rosenstock - Go On GetJohnny Hobo and the Fright Trains - Fuck CopsAsking for It - Sometimes Ramshackle Glory - Broken Heart I'm mainly into punk and folk punk, but genuinely enjoy all genres. 
Someone	feel.	Someone who can take away the loneliness I feel inside, and help me deal with my problems.   Someone who can empathize with me and make an effort to understand.   Someone who appreciates me and gives me unconditional love.   Someone to hold me when I am down and cannot get back up.   Someone to sit back and watch movies with on a lazy afternoon.   That would be ideal, that would be a life for me.   I just want to be close, I want to feel what those around me feel. 
New	it	New here, just curious about whether I have SA or not.  I checked the internet for symptoms and I think I have it
If	anymore.	If I'm gone, who will take care of my two rescue cats? I promised them I'd take care of them for the rest of their lives but I don't want to stay awake for 10+ more years.  I have a guaranteed, peaceful method available to me, I could fade out and be gone within 15 minutes, and cease to exist.  My parents wouldn't take care of them though, my one friend is allergic, another one has 7 cats now and I just don't know if he can handle 2 more.  I love them dearly and I can't leave unless I know they are going to be loved and cared for for the rest of their lives.  It pains me so much to keep living for them, I don't want to exist anymore. 
Well,	line	Well, first of all, i have to say sorry, my english is really bad.  But i can't talk about this in my mother tongue.  Actually i don't have anyone to talk about this.  Just my dog.  And he's really tired of this bullshit and so do i. Found this place typing wish i could die on google.  Was thinking if someone feels the same as me.  This feeling down your spirit saying you need to go.  I hear this voice all the time.  Everyday now.  Everyday i imagine an new way to die.  Jumping into the subway line
my mom's expecting excellences (the highest grade) in all of my exams	that is what I have done in my assessments throughout the year	So i'm in my second to last year of high school in NZ, currently on study leave.  I have had a pretty successful year academically even though it's been awful mentally.  Here's the thing:  <e1> my mom's expecting excellences (the highest grade) in all of my exams </e1>  because  <e2> that is what I have done in my assessments throughout the year </e2> .  She says that she will be proud of me as long as I try my best, but she also told me that merits wouldn't be good enough in biology after I told her I thought I could get merits in all of my bio exams but getting excellence would be really tough.  Obviously i'm going to do my best and personally I would be thrilled with a merit
So	it.	So I have intense email anxiety, I would think that being fairly young and growing up with emails I would be used to it, but the time it takes me to write an email is only as half as stressful as waiting for a response.  The amount of time is can take for someone to respond to an email has given me to enough time to declare that I am stupid for sending the email and that person thinks I'm not even worth to time to respond.  I'll even go as far as to feel embarrassed to talk the them in person next time I see them.  I guess I am just curious as to how other people have felt about email anxiety and how others deal with it.  
Let	(HRT)	Let me start with some back ground, I'm a 28 year old male with social phobia, agoraphobia, dysthemia, insomnia, and anxiety/panic disorder and many of these issues started as early as kindergarten, so they are far from new, outside the insomnia which developed right around the start of high school but I have been struggling with them all for a very long time.  I've had about 5 years in total of counseling/therapy.  I've tried many combinations of medications, none have had positive side effects, but there have been negative side effects.  Many therapists either give up on me or tell me things like We can only ever expect to make you about 10% better.  and two therapists have suggested I attend a personalized recovery oriented service(s) which I am very afraid of.  I'm in a long distance relationship with transgender female who is currently about 5 months into Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)
I	remember	I need some advice on how to handle something that I'm very anxious about.  The medical aspect is covered, so I'm not asking for medical advice.  EDIT: Her medical care is not the issue.  The second sentence of this post said I'm not asking for medical advice.  She has a clean bill of health. /EDITA bit of background (sorry, it's gross): As a small child, my grandmother was extremely controlling about what I ate.  I believe she had some kind of eating disorder.  If I was away from home, like with my other grandparents, I was required to list everything I had eaten.  If my choices weren't acceptable or I couldn't remember
Please	helps.	Please help.  I don't really know any sad songs, but I'm in that kinda mood right now.  I just want to cry my eyes out over good music.  I generally like indie music if it helps.  
A	new.	A couple good things happened past tramas and post trauma taken away all my hope.  I going to try to do this challenge it's ten things you wouldn't want to do.  Like yes man.  I'm still suicidal have regrets still no hope but before I die maybe I should do something new. 
What	Thanks	What urged you to begin smoking? I was curious as to the origins of other addictions besides my own.  Thanks
I constantly say the wrong word	I'm worried it makes me look stupid	I find that it can be a real struggle sometimes  to get words out.    <e1> I constantly say the wrong word </e1>  and  <e2> I'm worried it makes me look stupid </e2>  .  Any advice? How can I re-join the two? 
A	not.	A bad father:Is always talking down to youRarely if ever acknowledges your achievementsWill harass you over the tiniest grievances Dismisses your opinions Never sees the fault of their own actions Will only accept responsibility for positive effects in your life, and never the negative  I have learned this by living with one most of my life.  I have a memory for each point I've listed.  I tried to look the other way and find the positives as some people have said to do, but there is no gift or material possession that could possibly equate to the meaning of having a good supportive father or parent in your life.  I am sorry for those who will find these points familiar, and I envy those who do not.  
I'm	.	I'm so ashamed of myself.  Everything started to hurt badly and I didn't know what to do. . . I just wanted the pain to go away. . .  but I fucked up. . . and broke the promise that I would never cut again to my best friend.  I just want to be happy.  I don't know anymore. . . . 
I'm	slugs.	I'm on day 4, determined to quit - no cravings whatsoever.  I feel kind of sad but proud at the same time.  The thing that's been bugging me most of all is not the shortage of sleep, or lack of appetite, it's my sweaty hands. .  I swear! It's bad! They've transformed into slugs.  
Feeling	that.	Feeling a little numb.  I haven't posted here in a long time.  This was the kind of guy that was there for everyone - always there to talk to you and cheer you up or motivate you.  He updated his facebook last night at 8:45.  Today he is dead.  It was heroin for him but it could have been anything really.  Addiction is a disease - never for get that.  Alcohol is poison, literally a poison to the human body.  Be good to people and try to find joy in your sobriety.  You didn't get sober to be a sad sack.  You got sober to truly live.  Get the help you need, physical and mental, and don't sink into a sober darkness.  I love you all.  You are loved and understood.  Remember that. 
I'm just annoyed	Why couldn't they just tell me directly	They were talking about smoking pot and even that makes me uncomfortable.  I politely made a post publicly saying ag drugs please and they said I'm sorry.  I said it was fine and then they got mad at me?? They were saying that pot helps them with anxiety and I've heard that before but it also can worsen anxiety in others.  I don't want or like drugs and even pot makes me uneasy.  I wasn't even trying to be insensitive or rude to them.  I'm not nervous or upset (I was at first) but now  <e1> I'm just annoyed </e1> .    <e2> Why couldn't they just tell me directly </e2> ? I should note it was on their personal account and their bio said that substance use is mentioned but still.  
I was just curious	all of you guys' motivation starting to ramp back up again	I'm only on day 8.   <e1> I was just curious </e1>   whenever  <e2> all of you guys' motivation starting to ramp back up again </e2> ? I just have so much homework I need to do but I keep putting it off.  More so than when I smoked, but I will for sure get better grades not smoking.  I just am hoping I am as motivated as I feel like I once was to get good grades. 
I've	sick.	I've been LC since i moved out of Ndad's house this summer, and it's been bliss to finally feel like i had a little space carved out in my life that Ndad couldn't touch.  It made me feel so happy and peaceful to think abt how he didn't always know what i was doing, etc etc. And then i found out that flying monkeys - the small handful of people i really thought were trustworthy - had been feeding him info about me on a daily basis. I can't deal with this.  I only JUST made it to LC and it's a long long road until i'll be set up for NC.  I hate people so much.  Apparently i have to greyrock the entire world, no exceptions, until my NC plan is complete.  Which is. . . . way, way too long. I feel sick. 
The whole time she is yelling at me that it is my fault	my microwave is too strong	So my Nmom is incapable of ever taking any blame ever.  It's always my fault.  Today I was preparing for my son's birthday party.  My mother came over and decided to heat up some wrap for her back in my microwave.  She puts it in, turns it on, and walks away.  I am across the room making a cake and notice it seems to have been in there a while, still has a while to go.  I open the door and the fucker is smoking.  I yell that it's on fire.  My mother's immediate reaction is to try to gaslight me that it's not, of course.  So I close the door to rob it of oxygen.  The house starts to fill with smoke smell.  She tries to gaslight me there's no smoke.  She then pulls it out and it explodes all over my floor.  She's too infirm to vacuum, so now I have to vacuum and febreze myself in addition to everything else.   <e1> The whole time she is yelling at me that it is my fault </e1>  because  <e2> my microwave is too strong </e2> .  Yup
Ok,	work	Ok, so here's the thing, my gf (she's 15 I'm 16) gets mad about the stupidest things, and after that we both feel miserable and she's just sick of being like this and wants to change to not hurt me or our relationship anymore.  So, any tips to help her manage her anger?If it is of any help I'll let you know she has few friends, is quite shy (I never appreciate enoguh how brave she was to tell me that she loved me), doesn't have exactly good grades and her father treats her like shit.  He sometimes hits her and stuff, I want her to leave that house asap.  Also her mother never defends her against her father and. . . well I think that's it.  I'd love to get some help from you guys, really want to make that relationship work
The thought of ending my life now seems like a logical decision	I'm afraid of what I'll do if I don't	This is scaring the shit out of me. I think I've genuinely gone insane.   After 2 years of having thoughts of self-harm and killing myself, the anger is beginning to stem off and I feel an incredible sense of hatred towards people. I just want someone willing to listen.   Everyone I know left me.   Either ignoring me or letting me know I was unwanted. I was in the process of seeking professional help multiple times but it never resolved.   I feel like even those in the medical sector don't give a shit about me.   <e1> The thought of ending my life now seems like a logical decision </e1>  because   <e2> I'm afraid of what I'll do if I don't </e2> . 
I know I can never be happy without him	we broke up for several years before getting back together	Can't sleep.  Can't eat.  Can't get out of bed.  Just so depressed and anxious without him.  I still don't understand how he goes from being affectionate and loving to full-on ignoring me overnight.  This happens every time he's manic.  He won't talk to me at all and then when he's back to normal he feels terrible for pushing me away, but then he does it again whenever the mania sets in.  I don't know which part of him is real.  I wish he would remember that I have done nothing but love him, and that he can trust me.  But when he starts getting paranoid, he doesn't trust anyone.  Despite all of this, I'm still so in love with him, and so afraid of losing him for good.    <e1> I know I can never be happy without him </e1>  because  <e2> we broke up for several years before getting back together </e2> , and I was even more unhappy than I am now.  I just wish he could always be the way he is when things are good.  Attentive, considerate, affectionate, kind, funny. . .  and then in a matter of a few hours it can all change.  
So,	today.	So, what I've learned is that I can't have 1 or 2.  I don't enjoy it.  I always want more.  I don't want to drink.  I somehow find myself in spots where I'm sneaking drink after drink.  The world (normally my wife) sees 2 when it's actually 6 - or more. Then sometimes Sunday night happens and the wife puts 2 and 2 together and calls me out.  Then the threats begin and the (worse) defense of my actions begins (which is always insane, drunken blabbering about why my actions aren't my fault). Today's day 2, but I'm no longer afraid of being defined as an alcoholic.  My wife is desperate for me to TELL EVERYONE but I'd prefer to simply switch to I don't drink (to folks I haven't binged with before) and to I don't drink anymore (to the rest). I have told all family.  I'm an alcoholic.  Drinking's not for me. I will not drink with any of you handsome bastards and pretty bastardettes today. 
When	religious	When I first got sober, I also started to get back into shape. This involved shorter, lower impact workouts than I do now.  I worked my way through certain routines, my body got thinner, faster, stronger, and I was able to change what I needed to do to make progress. Recently, I went back to AA for the first time in Round 2 of sobriety.  In Round 1, I had found it very helpful, for awhile.  Some things started to grate on me, and it eventually became harmful. But I wanted to see if maybe I was incorrectly analyzing the information, so I went back. As a not-very-religious person, I tolerated that side of AA for the other benefits. However, the subject the day I walked back in was Letting Go and Letting God. About the absolute worst topic for me.  Even when I was religious
I	lie	I went to campus counselling hoping to get some discrete and private help for my depression and anxiety, it was awkward and hard for me to do to begin with, bit I was assured that they were there to listen and spend time one on one with studentsWell it turns out that was a fucking lie
job less	I wasn't able to afford the medication, doctor visit, or the insurance itself	Hello,So my life has a complicated background.  I've suffered from depression for 10 years.  I took medication for the past 2 years.  However due to  <e1> job less </e1>    <e2> I wasn't able to afford the medication, doctor visit, or the insurance itself </e2> .  That being said, I went off the medication cold turkey.  I felt like I was losing my mind and I was in a horrible place.  I did want to take my life but I didn't know how I would do it.  Each day I wake up and feel like I don't want to be here.  Everyone tells me there are so many people who love me and will miss me.  And I just honestly can't care anymore. I feel that I can't feel love anymore.  I know my friends and family are concerned for me.  But, I just can't feel the warmth of love from anyone or anything.  Is it gone? Does anyone else have the same feeling of not being able to feel love? I know people love me.  But it seems like empty words when I say it to whoever.  I can't actually feel the meaning behind the words. 
A	Whoops.	A couple of years ago I was a goalkeeper for a football ('soccer') team, and have finally put two and two together as to why people got angry at me all the time.  Whoops. 
I'm	it.	I'm curious as to how open you all are about your ADHD.  Personally I'm very open and most people i interact with know i have it.  
I	Reddit.	I having been doing relatively really well lately.  But today I am traveling.  I felt prepared.  I got to the airport early and was all set.  But, my ID wasn't acceptable and my alternative ID was good, but still required extra screening.  I had to have a pat down.  .  .  I am still shaking.  I ended up crying and making them stop a few times.  Touchingly is a big trigger.  And, they wouldn't let me put my arms down or move so I felt safer.  It was terrible.  And I've been doing so well.  I'm still shaking, but I got to my gate.  Edit: Thank you for the encouragement.  At the gate I was able to calm myself down enough to carry on and when I read your suggestions after I landed I felt even more relieved.  Sometimes, I feel that I'm the only one who is silly enough to cry at the TSA people.  Thanks, Reddit.  
not	worse.	not for a specific reason, I just tend to be depressed around this time of year.  i think this time i've had it once and for all.  i'm tempted as fuck but i'm not going to do anything today.  but if it doesn't get better in the next week. .  at least i'll know i'm giving myself an out.  knowing i'll have to keep going until it gets better (or so they say) just makes it all worse. 
We	in.	We just sent him to a rehab center after his behavior spiraled out of control.  He has severe physical and psychological  problems resulting from 6 months of meth use, hashish and tobacco.  To the point of him defecating blood and waking up to 'everything around him shaking'.  He was one of the smartest guys I knew and I don't know what the fuck has he turned into.  His mother's worried sick and cries and he refuses to believe he has psychological issues.  Claims everyone around him is crazy.  Wouldn't stop repeating paragraphs and slurring speech.  One of my concerns is if rehab centers take care of physical health problems.  Do they monitor patients constantly? At least in the first few days.  I'm hoping he doesn't get a heart attack in which case I'm not sure if rehab's the right place to be in. 
So	or?	So I've got an actual diagnosis, but what really stands out is - I don't think I have PtSD or CPTSD, or an abusive childhood, or any trauma or drama in my upbringing.  But then this makes me feel worried about how I've developed this when most-but-not-all other people have had these experiences.  I'm even considering asking my parents if there's something they haven't told me about my past, but then that seems paranoid. I understand that people with the label are different.  Looking to chat with anyone else here diagnosed/self-diagnosed, but who also doesn't have incidences of trauma.  Do you think we just got biologically/chemically predisposed to it, or do you think that smaller invalidating things caused it, or?
i	care.	i am tired.  i am done.  i am wrung out of all energy and motivation.  depression and anxiety for the past six years and its goddamn exhausting.  no, it WAS goddamn exhausting, now it's just a insufferable fact.  i don't want to finish this year.  i don't want to see my mother's hateful expression.  family trouble, aggressive mother, accusing my dad and i of incest.  my dad is the only person in my family i can trust.  i called the police on my mother.  it's a terrible thing to do, though it may be considered right in this situation.  i feel like utter, run down bullshit.  last year of school is putting extra stress on me and i just dont care anymore.  i just dont feel anything anymore, fear of getting bad grades i just want to run away or disappear from this.  i dont care anymore.  and it scares me how much i dont care.  
I	College	I was amazed at the things I was grateful for: those painful situations that served to show me my character defects; the ability to accept and share my pain with others; the opportunities to do things I was afraid to do which gave me strength and confidence. State College
So	meds?	So I've been on my meds for a little over a week now and this has been one of the best effects.  It doesn't quite feel like motivation, but more so I just have an easier time starting, working on, and completing tasks.  It's also easier for me to release myself from a distraction and do something productive.  When I'm off meds, all I want to do is lay around on my iPad and I get stuck in a steady cycle of Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, checking email, repeat.  This lasts for hours and sometimes the entire day.  Can someone explain what's happening here?Edit: I'm more so looking for a scientific answer of what part of my brain the meds are affecting.  Obviously I am capable of doing things I want/need to do, but why is it almost impossible when I'm off meds?
I	.	I remember a time when all my feelings were normal and coherent.  I remember when I could be happy one day and still be happy the next.  I remember when I could keep up with school.  It's all so challenging now. . . 
I	down	I have been on my medication for a few months now and it has helped me in every way.  My only problem ( aside from the extreme dry mouth) is my now, unquenchable, sex drive. At first I just had abit of a higher labido and then it got abit frustrating and now its really annoying.  Is there anything i can do to make this go away? I am female so an orgasm is basically a few seconds of pleasure and then my vagina says  one down
I	?	I am suffering from anxiety disorder and I am struggling with it for past 15 years.  I try to show others as if I am fine and happy but deep down I am struggling with anxious feelings . Source of my anxiety is worrying too much and this has become my nature.  I am on cipralex 10mg for past 10 years but it has no effect on my thoughts. My doctor prescribed me fluvoxamine 50mg.  I am waiting to see any positive effects.  My mind always stuck with these what if kinds of thoughts.  I have read many books, listened many audios on worrying but that hasn't changed my situation a bit. What's your take on worrying ?
I'm	suggestions?	I'm a male with ADHD and anxiety in my early 20's.   I've been having sexual problems as of lately.  My libido is down and when I do bring a girl home sometimes I have a problem getting it up.  I take vvyanse and lexapro everyday but the issue has been happening before I started both.  There is no issue when I'm trying to masturbate so I'm freaking out a little bit.  Do any of you have any suggestions?
I also feel emotionally numb	I cant feel love or true happiness	I feel overwhelmed by my social anxiety.  Speaking to others face to face is a chore to me.  My scopophobia makes things 100x worse.  I also feel like im living a double life, I put on this mask of being happy/content at work then I come home and Im super exhausted and depressed.   <e1> I also feel emotionally numb </e1>  as in  <e2> I cant feel love or true happiness </e2> .  Sometimes living sucks :(
As	thanks!	As the title suggests I need an accountability buddy for this week as I have a list of things to do regarding University work and finding a new job.  If anyone is willing to help please let me know! I'd be happy to return the favor, thanks!
I stay at my boyfriend's house even when he scares me and makes me sad	I'd rather that than be alone	I rely on other people to be able to feel like I can get out of bed, feed, and dress myself.    <e1> I stay at my boyfriend's house even when he scares me and makes me sad </e1>  because  <e2> I'd rather that than be alone </e2> .  He doesn't want me here anymore and his mum hates having me around.  If I have to be around people who don't want me just to have a chance to outrun these thoughts, then what quality of life am I even going for?I laughed at a dog video and he berated me until I stopped.  It was the first time I was truly happy today and now I'm already back in the comfortable depths of self loathing and depression.  Wahoo!
I've had some genuinely good experiences drunk	I'm more confident and assertive and honest	My life is pretty fucking miserable and when I drink I'm numb for a few hours.  I always regret it afterwards but only for a little bit, and I joke about my drinking problem a lot.  I'm a virgin at a high school where everyone is fucking 24/7 so alcohol is the one wrong thing I can do.  I honestly can't decide whether I like drinking or hate it.  I don't feel that once I start drinking I just can't stop or that I can't quit whenever I want or any of the stereotypes about alcoholics.   <e1> I've had some genuinely good experiences drunk </e1>  because  <e2> I'm more confident and assertive and honest </e2> 
Most of those who post in here have long paragraphs that go into great detail and have deep though behind it	we get super excited about things that interest us	  <e1> Most of those who post in here have long paragraphs that go into great detail and have deep though behind it </e1>  because  <e2> we get super excited about things that interest us </e2>  and put a lot of that hyperactive energy into those effortsButNone of us have the attention span to read long posts all the way through lolOh life. . .  xD
I'm growing distant from my friends	I don't want them to know	Hi Reddit,I have gone to bed drunk almost every night since my appendectomy in January (and I was drinking a lot before surgery).  Most mornings I don't remember going to bed, only vague snippets of Netflix or games I played the night before while drunk.  I'm at university and hardly passing my classes,   <e1> I'm growing distant from my friends </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want them to know </e2> ), and I can tell my formally healthy body is fading from poor nutrition and too much alcohol.  Every morning I wake up and tell myself I'm going to stop drinking and every night I buy more beer.  I know I have a problem but can't seem to cross the invisible line between pride and asking for help.  I can't seem to help myself.  I don't really know what I'm hoping for in writing this but this is my first semi-public acknowledgment that I have a problem and need help.  I can't seem to help myself even though I know I need to.  Thanks for reading. . . 
It	using?	It seems like Skyping with a therapist is less expensive than seeing one in person and out of network, so I'm investigating that option.   Is anyone really happy (or unhappy) with a service they're using?
im	10mg.	im not sure how to find out what missing a dose means or how to get back to my 10mg steady state quickly and safely. any words are appreciated, thank you. edit: got my medicine.   lived through 24 hours ;)  now its a matter of  missing a dose and immediately taking 10mg. 
I	Matt	I know what I'm in for, I'm prepared to sleep less than an hour a night, feel like I have the flu for weeks, and that kind of stuff.  I was curious if any of you had some advice on how to limit the symptoms (harder than it sounds, I know).  Over the counter medicine/supplements I can buy, things I can do to help with the RLS, etc. Thanks guys Matt
I'm truly still shocked	you chose to be MY friend	You are an amazing person and  <e1> I'm truly still shocked </e1>    <e2> you chose to be MY friend </e2> .  I'm sorry I'm not good enough.  I'm sorry I'm so fucked up.  I'm sorry I lean on you.  I'm sorry I can't get through my depression.  I'm sorry I'm not who I used to be.  I'm sorry I'm unmotivated.  I'm sorry about everything.  I love you with all of my heart, I know you love me too. . . but I'm so tired of hurting.  Of not having answers.  Of not being happy.  Of not being genuine.  Of fucking everything and everyone I come in contact with, up.  I am so sorry. . . I'm tired.  I am just so tired.  I want to be done.  I wish I could somehow make everyone OK with that, once I'm gone, I don't want anyone to feel sad.  I'll be free.  I love you.  I'm sorry. 
I don't feel like going forward with getting diagnosed.	there's nothing wrong with me as long as I can paint	Just a few days ago I found really good brushes for photoshop.  I got too excited about them and now all I can think about is all the great shit I want to create.  I honestly have green light inside me head for staying home and do digital painting tomorrow.  Another thing that keeps popping up in my head is that   <e1> I don't feel like going forward with getting diagnosed.  </e1>  because  <e2> there's nothing wrong with me as long as I can paint </e2>  . I want to add another thing here.  Is anyone else here obsessed with scenery? Do you rather take the longer route just to see those tall trees that look pleasant and try to avoid seeing buildings and houses with ugly color and design? Scenery can REALLY affect my mood in a big way.  If a view is just not right it can actually make me feel uncomfortable. 
They	everything.	They never want to deal with anything head on.  My dad is always talking about worst case scenarios and injects fear into every decision we make in the worst possible ways.  He's kind of a jerk to my sister and acts like she's an idiot all the time and it stresses her out.  My mom is a selfish bitch who only cares about getting what she wants and I don't even talk to her anymore.  None of them are very good at being supportive, and I don't think any of them realize that they're kind of emotionally disconnected from everything. 
I	:(	I have read that a big deal of narc children suffer from this.  I tend to feel very sad at times with no apparent reason, and I was wondering if again my Nmum was the creator :(
I got nervous but I was happy	that had never happened to me	I am so sick of myself.  [M/20] Two nights ago I was at a birthday party and this really cute girl was looking at me the entire time, being the stupid idiot that I am I just fell embarrassed and tried to avoid eye contact.  So when we were leaving, the girl gave her number to my sister and told her to give it to me.   <e1> I got nervous but I was happy </e1>  because  <e2> that had never happened to me </e2> .  And now, two days later I still haven't texted her.  I've typed hi a million times but I just get so nervous I literally start shaking and feeling physical pain
I	extent	I dont know how i ended up like this.  Suddenly im buying coke twice a week and spending all night by myself masturbating a limo dick.  No matter how depressed i get the next day, all it takes is a single day for ke to return.  Im terrified that i have no control over myself and im embarassed to tell anyone else.  I thought i had it under control and but every time i just go back in.  Despite health problems and losing money and brain cells i cant stop Help, what can i do? I told my parentw before but they dont know the full extent
Im	alone.	Im about four years clean, I don't really count days or time cause it drives me batty.  Point being is I was watching a TV show and unexpectedly had a scene of my drug of choice, my method of choice and in a very UP close personal way.  All of the things that I loved about it were showcased like the ritualistic things.  Now I have that feeling, that anxious I wanna go do something feeling.  My husband is away so I'm alone.  I keep playing it through as if I were going to do it , like what am I going to wake up my two year old, put him in the car and drive to the dealer who I don't even know if he still deals and buy? Even though in all practicality and everything I KNOW I won't do and I KNOW it's not even possible I can't stop thinking of it.  I just needed to come and say it and let SOMEONE know what's going on with me.  I just need to know I'm not alone.  
Feeling	life	Feeling a bit helpless I'm a 17 year old guy and have had tritch for 6 years.  It cripples me socially and makes my life considerably worse.  I am talking Zoloft, NAC, and going to a therapist for cognitive therapy.  Do you guys have any other suggestions anything would be appreciated.  Sick of this disorder sabotaging my life
this feeling of unreality also validates my worry	I feel so horribly disconnected from myself	I'm currently obsessed that I have schizophrenia and have been noticing coincidences/symptoms in the form of intrusive thoughts I can't shake.  For example, if I'm feeling pretty tense and anxious (as I usually am) and watch TV, they might mention something completely coincidentally related to my situation, like a mention of mental illness or schizophrenia.  This makes my panic spiral out of control, I don't know if I truly believe it's coincidental or if it's a delusion of reference (it's certainly a very strong and terrifying thought at the time) but all I do know is it completely validates my fear that I'm becoming schizophrenic.  Or, if I panic and get dissociative symptoms,   <e1> this feeling of unreality also validates my worry </e1> ; because  <e2> I feel so horribly disconnected from myself </e2> , my surroundings and the people around me, I panic more and think things like yeah
Recently	this?	Recently I decided to take my ADHD seriously and am really proud of my progress.  I've adapted a lot of the suggestions on this subreddit to help me in my daily life, in particularly following a to do list religiously has helped me get a lot of stuff done.  Right now I'm trying to learn how to create a video game for android devices but my brain keeps coming up with thoughts that are just irrelevant to what I'm doing and they are really distracting.  Does anybody have any suggestions on how to better manage this? 
I	to.	I went to a health fair on Tuesday, and they said my blood pressure was 178/106 and I needed to go see a doctor.  I went to see my doctor and she said I had to quit drinking, quit smoking, and clean up my diet or I would die. I haven't had a drink, smoked a cigarette, or eaten more than 2000mg of salt in a day since Tuesday.  I feel like crap.  I can barely function.  I am hungry all the time.  I don't like this.  I feel like I don't have anything to look forward to.  I've been checking my bp twice a day and its still a mess. I'm just frustrated and not feeling well.  I haven't slept for shit since I quit drinking.  I lay and stare at the ceiling for hours and then I'm exhausted the entire next day. I really wanna go back.  I can't, but I really want to. 
Hello	:/	Hello all, I was hoping to hear other people's experiences with this medication.  I've had OCD and intrusive thoughts since I was 10, and am 20(F) now.  I also had generalized anxiety disorder and a panic disorder that became chronic after a personal trauma that occurred in at the start of the new year. After trying to work through my day to day life using homeopathic remedies/gym/therapy I realized my daily life has become severely inhibited and my relationships with those close to me threatened by constant intrusive thoughts, uncontrollable emotions -- we all get the picture.  I have been on fluvox for around two week, and understand that this may be too early to see the proper results however, fear this may be the wrong medication.  While my intrusive thoughts and compulsions have decreased, substantially! My anxiety, insomnia and night terrors have increased ! Has anyone else had a similar experience? Did you switch to an alternative medication?Thank you in advance to anyone who repliesCheers Edit: I do mean Luvox/Fluvoxamine! but I cannot change the title and wrote this post after three days of no sleep! :/
I	evening	I grew up in an era where a dad would be proud taking his boy out to drink his first beer.  See him smile when I had my first shit drunk episode where he was laughing when I puked my guts out, stopping the car every 30 minutes.  He would also be the one telling me if you act like a man in the evening
Hi	sub.	Hi /r/ADHD,TL;DR: Really sensitive to Vyvanse, having trouble sleeping, what do?I'm being treated for ADHD-PI and OCD.  I'm currently taking Vyvanse 30mg and Lexapro 20mg as well as other OTC medication for seasonal allergies.  This combo really helps with both disorders, but I have trouble getting to sleep at night.  I actually set a second alarm an hour before I wake up to take the Vyvanse, but, even though I'm at a very low dosage, I can feel the effects well into the evening and I have trouble getting focused on sleeping.  Eating something when I take the Vyvanse seems to help, but I hate breakfast and it's really hard for me to eat right after I get up. My doc suggested I open the capsules and try a manually lower dosage, but I wanted to know if anyone has had success trying anything else? I've considered medical marijuana, but I have a job that requires a lot of math and I don't really like how marijuana affects my cognitive abilities. Thanks! Love this sub. 
Does	way?	Does anyone experience things being louder, brighter, darker, more anxious when they're off meds? I noticed when i'm on them all of my senses feel more integrated and the world is less intense in a good way? 
I	Me	I don't get a lot of the emotional symptoms others seems to get when it comes to depression.  Sadness and hopelessness don't come to mind.  My depression feels like there are earmuffs on my brain.  It's like I'm in this hungover and treacherous fog.  If I'm the slightest bit sleep deprived, the fog get exponentially thicker.  What the fuck is wrong with my brain? Why the fuck is this shit so common? It literally makes zero sense from an evolutionary point of view.  Wanting to kill yourself, zero sex drive, little appetite.  There are very few reasons for me to be depressed with my current life.  It's some fucking illness that I can't even put into words for the doctors I've seen.  Fuck Me 
People	friends?	People would never guess that I am depressed.  I am always so positive towards life, always telling jokes, laughing  and smiling.  But inside I'm fighting depression hard. . .  always feeling like a blank spiritless person.  What if there are others who are close to me feeling the same way? I often wonder. . . .  :( what if my parents are depressed but they hide it from me? Or my friends? 
I	advice?	I am a firm believer in adult odd.  I have a terrible issue with figures of authority.  I believe that this has been an issue in all of my jobs and am also afraid that I'm going to be fired soon.  I have been looking for coping mechanisms but the only things I can find are coping mechanisms for parents dealing with children who have odd.  Does anybody have any advice?
I	great.	I had little over 100 days in legit.  but met up with some smoker friends and had a few.  after some struggles ive somehow managed to only do 1 a week for 2 months now.  i really dont know how it happened.  im so grateful it did tho.  im the first person who will tell you 1 a week makes it so much harder.  but idk how i guess ive just been distracted too well this time.  havent been bored enough to make myself go mad thinking about it.  also i have pretty much just been hanging out with smokers once a week. anyway its kinda under control.  im 22 i knew from the start that its not gonna be easy to quit forever.  idk what im doing with this 1 a week thing.  i missed last week's cig and am bored so my mind is messing with me with thoughts kinda why im here. anyway how often do u guys reset? it looks great. 
I have several internal flights to meet friends	I can't be asleep	So I've booked a solo Holiday.  I've never been a good flyer and I usually just down nitrazepam.  This time  <e1> I have several internal flights to meet friends </e1>  so  <e2> I can't be asleep </e2> .  Any flying anxiety tips appreciated.  I have full blown panic attacks. 
Hey	this!	Hey everyone, Just wanted to introduce myself.  My name is Jacob.  My relationship with cigarettes is kind of complicated.  I started smoking when I was 15.  I smoked half a pack a day until I was 23, when I quit for two years.  Stupidly, I started smoking again last year.  But just recently I quit cold turkey.  Haven't had a smoke since October 27th.  I've started a blog about quitting smoking/staying healthy, something to keep me motivated to stay quit this time.  So, yeah, just wanted to say hi and wish everyone good luck with their quits.  We can do this!   
I	home.	I wonder whether this is the culprit for anyone else who has agoraphobia? I'm afraid to go out of fear of eventually feeling like I'm standing knee deep in water with nothing to drink - surrounded by people but being unable to talk or connect with them, I'm left with only my own brain for company; the feeling of disconnect gets unbearable and eventually it gets terrifying enough for me to want to seek the safety of home.  
I would cut it out, and jump to something else	I'm not addicted to anything	For the past couple of years I chose to deal with traumatic events in my life by running to drugs.  It doesn't matter what it is if it gets me high I'm doing it.  It's been a vicious circle of convincing myself that I'm not an addict and jumping from one drug to the next. I would be on a coke binge for three weeks and realize that I was becoming co-dependent on it, so  <e1> I would cut it out, and jump to something else </e1>  because  <e2> I'm not addicted to anything </e2> 
I want to reach out to my friends and talk to them	I think they've given up on me in a way	I'm at work, in my office, which on most days is a miracle unto itself.   <e1> I want to reach out to my friends and talk to them </e1> ,  because  <e2> I think they've given up on me in a way </e2> .  It's hard to be friends with a person who is miserable and hasn't gotten any help.  I feel bad reaching out to them.  It feels selfish of me, when we all have our shit to deal with.  I tried with one already this morning and just cried on the phone, which isn't something I can really do at work.  I have a presentation to do in an hour and I don't know if I'll be able to hold it together.  But no one else can do it but me, so I have no choice in the matter.  I want to go home and crawl back onto my couch and back under my blanket.  I did make a step today though.  I submitted my name to a referral service so I can get connected to a therapist who will be able to help me.  Baby steps, right? 
I	anymore.	I have trouble feeling emotions and it feels horrible.  I don't know what I want and honestly it doesn't even feel like I do want anything, I'm just empty.  It's difficult to explain it exactly especially when I've never been good with words.  The best way to put is just that I'm empty and it feels horrible, I don't have desires, much feeling, or anything anymore. 
So,	Like	So, after a few years of dealing with issues (first manifesting as a lot of issues with severe depression and anxiety, and then into the more standard issues of ADHD) I finally convinced myself to go down and get checked out.  I was told it would be about 2 weeks before I could come in and talk about diagnosis and am worried I failed the testing.  Like
I	later.	 I was an atheist.  I'm almost glad I got it over with sooner rather than later. 
I'm constantly in fear of losing some part of my life	some mistake that I can't identify	I don't know what it is.  I feel like my life is just hanging in some false state.  I can be feeling happy and then remember that it's not right, that I've done something wrong and I've got maybe an hour, or a day, or a month, until everything comes back at me.  I'm paranoid that there's some mistake I've made somewhere, recently, that I have to regret. But I never actually remember that life-destroying error.    <e1> I'm constantly in fear of losing some part of my life </e1>  because of   <e2> some mistake that I can't identify </e2> .  When someone talks to me I often think they're going to tell me what I've done so terribly wrong, and what I'm going to lose from it.  It's a feeling that never properly goes away. And then there a mistakes I remember that never had their potential consequences, where I'm scared those consequences will play out soon.  Something I said a month ago might suddenly resurface and tear my life apart.  It never does, but that doesn't alleviate the feeling. How do I make it go away?
I	relationships?	I remember with my ex, while I was on my meds I wouldn't like being touched, couldn't express affection, and basically would be like an emotionless, detached zombie.  I would always warn her before hand that the way I was acting while on meds was not how I felt, but was just the medicine.  She understood for awhile but I think it secretly really started to bother/upset her.  Anyone else have any similar stories, experiences, or advice for future relationships?
Hey	worried.	Hey everyone, I'm an 18 year old male who's been feeling fatigued pretty much all day long for over a month now with various other symptoms on and off such as shortness of breath, dizziness, brain fog, more frequent bowel movements, gas, and chest pains. I've been to the doctors office twice and at first they thought I had a virus and the second time they thought it was anxiety.  They increased the dosage of my anxiety medication and told me various other methods to reduce anxiety.  I've given it a few weeks and my anxiety symptoms have improved although im still worried and my other symptoms haven't gone away.  My question is whether or not anyone else has experienced these symptoms and whether or not you think I should be worried. 
I'm	to.	I'm a 19-year-old girl, and I think I'm done with life.  I've been depressed for more than six years and it's only getting worse.  I'm done with being the ugliest, fattest, loneliest and shittiest human being.  Please help.  I have _no one_ to talk to.  
I'm	down?	I'm starting Vyvanse at 20 mg for a week, which I've been told is a low dose.  If it works okay for me, I will start taking 30 mg for another week. What are some side effects you guys have experienced? How long does the effects last? And any advice on how to lessen the crash or come down? 
Since	formatting	Since middle school (after grade school, before high school), I started sitting with my feet on the chair in one form or the other.  It's a weird little thing I've tweaked and honed over the years.  I'm more aware of my sitting styles and quite frankly I just don't care now that I'm a college senior.   some positions:* both feet on chair, knees sort of touching my chin* legs sprawled to the side, nearly horizontal, hella slouched* one feet up one feet down* criss cross applesauce * squatting (ohh godd so embarrassing but helps me focus)I'm pretty sure these are physical manifestations of my ADD symptoms but just want to know if it's prevalent in this community.  Thanks a bunch :)edit: formatting 
Hi	sister	Hi all, I should start with saying thank you to this amazing community.  I lurked here for a while before going Low Contact with my mother. I've maintained that low contact for just over a year now.  I know I will never go NC with her as it would cause more problems than it would solve - she's always been the cause of a lot of family division since her and my father divorced (think I'm not going to [event] if [step mother] is there leading to every birthday and holiday being celebrated twice) and I don't want to engage in that. Anyway - on Wednesday night I found out that she had taken an overdose and was in the emergency room.  I heard from my sister
want to know what I should tell him	I'm terrible with words	One of my best friends is going through a really bad time.   He keeps mentioning how he's just a nobody, and that he just sick of everything and just wants it to end.  I have no idea what to do or say, I've tried some general logos and pathos, he's not changed at all.  I'm really worried about him and  <e1> want to know what I should tell him </e1> ,   because  <e2> I'm terrible with words </e2> . Thanks
I don't count it	it was brought on by Effexor	Hello! (first time posting to Reddit in general-- hi!)This is me:(this may be TL:DR)I have bipolar II (although therapist says maybe Bipolar I, since I had a major manic episode about 10 years ago-- but  <e1> I don't count it </e1>  because  <e2> it was brought on by Effexor </e2> -- the complete wrong drug for me, but did I know any better at the time? No.  Was I diagnosed for at least 3 years after this occurred? No.  Anyway, I blame the major 'sode on the Effexor, and don't count it as organic. )I'm into trying alternative, non-allopathic initial forms of treatment for medical problems In General, so when my PMHNP started talking about anti-psychotics, my mind went straight to dread of Cuckoo's nest style stultification.  No no no no no.  Even the word Lamictal seems so foreboding. . .  Even Abilify seems like a harsh drug cloaked in a sweet word.  So
I feel so useless and pathetic	I can't get anything done	I've been more fried than usual lately and it's killing me.   Not only is it finals week, but I've been trying to get everything in order for me to graduate.  If this weren't frying enough, I've been overwhelmed by how messy I've let my life get and the stress and pressure to get myself organized is starting to fry me more.  I'm beginning to just freak out and mentally bash myself for not having everything together and my family is really the always organized and structured sort so I just feel like they're judging me even more harshly.   <e1> I feel so useless and pathetic </e1>  because  <e2> I can't get anything done </e2> . 
I	this.	I don't want to generalize but I feel like something in my life has made me an addict and I want to find out what.  I have a past sexual abuse from foster brothers growing up that I never really dealt with.  What they did to me wasnt right but I'm ashamed to say the 10 year old me was more than happy to participate at that time and when we got caught I acted like i was being taken advantage of even tho I sometimes initiated it.  I feel like this shame has had a lot to do with my addictive behaviour and poor impulse control.  My foster brothers are locked up and dead now so talking to them about this is out of the question how do I move past this. 
I'm	work?	I'm currently working at home teaching music lessons and doing some occasional web and graphic design work.  I love it but I'm constantly stressed about not earning enough money.  If I just went out and got a part time job I could be earning so much more, and that can help support me while I do what I really love to do.  But every job I've had before has felt way too overwhelming for me to handle.  Since starting counseling I feel I might have more tools to handle my anxiety at work but I'm still very afraid of dreading every day again. .  Even if it was just a part time job. What do you all do for work? Do you like your job? How do you deal with anxiety at work?
Hi,	hers	Hi, I'm the person who started taking their SSRI yesterday.  Ive had less side effects on day 2 than day 1 so that's good.  I'm not officially diagnosed (I'm waiting for psych referral) but I have lots of worries, most of them around my bf and him comparing me to other women, him cheating on me, us being incompatible, me not being attractive/funny/cool enough. . . . etc. etc. I was curious about whether CBT strategies worked for your thoughts.  Whenever I try to come up with realistic thoughts, I find a way to say but what about x that completely destroys it. I was at a party where I thought my bf unconsciously liked this loud extroverted girl.  I tried to tell myself he is laughing at everyone's jokes not just hers
So	now	So I have an issue with alcohol and bad situations i've got myself into over the years is nothing in comparison to what i did last night.  I have never humilated myself so much in my life the way i did last night and im not even sure if what i did was spotted by people at the party which just makes my post drinking paranoia even worse.  I can't even bring myself to write what i did on this? Has anyone done or said something and humilated themselves so badly? How do you ever recover from it and how do you cope with what people will say about you? I just dont seem to give a shit about myself anymore and im determined to bring my whole life down.  My diginity and self respect has gone out the window and i cant seem to figure why i do this to myself.  Im beyond restarting - ive done it so many times, i just find life so boring at times and i feel empty and sad.   Im in a really bad place right now 
She	listening.	She has constant panic attacks about the stupidest things.  Things she can't change.  The thing is I've been through the same thing.  I'm on zoloft and it changed my life.  She is on Prozac and Xanax and she still panics about everything.  She literally cries for when I have to go to work.  She is in a community band and she gets extremely stressed out before every performance but she won't quit.  She will only make plans if I can go and If I can't she gets sad and angry with me.  I told her I don't always have to go to everything.  I'm tired of being a crutch.  It doesn't last forever and I just needed to vent.  Thanks for listening. 
Okay	dose.	Okay so back in my late teens early 20's I took Adderall XR and it was like a miracle drug.  Fast forward havn't taken it in about 10 or 12 years.  Got a script today.  First hour felt Amazing, felt very focused and like things slowed down for me.  Then about two hours in I am starting to get waves of feeling very speedy and then back to feeling good and focused and will catch another wave of feeling very speedy.  Wondering if I should ask to drop dosage or if I should give it a few days to settle in.  I got started on a 20mg dose.  
This	at	This topic comes up a lot, so let's put our brains together.  If you love your job - speak up! If you don't, just jump in to brainstorm ideas.  Below is a guideline for what MIGHT make a job ADHD-friendly - bear in mind I'm not doctor and it's just from my experience.  Add or delete as you see fit! And bear in mind, your talents and personality are a big factor in determining what job you'll love. **What makes a job ADHD-friendly?*** Allows for frequent movement* Allows worker to be in the moment - urgent work and not long, drawn out deadlines* Relatively low stakes  - i. e.  nobody will die if you're late to work* Can be done part-time or at odd hours* Has immediate external validation when tasks are completed* Does not require much to be stored in working memory * Can be left at the office and promotes work-life balanceMy list so far:* **Proofreader** by far the most ADHD-friendly job I've had.  At the agency I'm contracting at
Hey	awful.	Hey guys,Wasn't sure where to post this but you are a great community and I feel like someone here might relate.  It's finals week at college and I'm extremely stressed.  I'm almost positive I'm failing 2 classes and getting C's or B's in the remaining 3.   I haven't been sleeping well either. . .  Anyways, I have had this horrible feeling inside me that feels like I am dying.  I don't know how else to describe it. . .  it feels like I'm infinitely falling off a building. .  the way your stomach drops and heart panics for a split second when you go down a roller coaster. . . I think it might be anxiety, but I'm not sure.  I've never felt this way before.  It's such a foreign, ominous feeling. . .  like I'm being consumed.  Has anyone ever felt this way before? I just had to tell someone. . .  It feels awful. 
So,	off	So, my boyfriend is depressed and I knew it long before we started dating so I knew what I was going into.  I'll keep this short. He's always been extremely in love with me, but then a couple of months ago he said he was having issues with apathy and was not intentioned to fight against it.  We were still together, though, but the situation was a downhill from then on.  He was getting colder at moments, and then he was sweet again.  Then since last week he's having a depression crisis and wouldn't see me claiming he wasn't in the mood.  But he would go out with his friends.  Then yesterday he suddenly asked me for some time off
I'm	improvement.	I'm doing a medicine dance here, trying to figure out the right meds.  I started with Adderall XR 10 mg, once a day, then Ritalin 5mg x2 twice a day, then Adderall IR 10 mg twice a day, now Focalin 2. 5mg  twice a day.  The Adderall XR seemed to work well at first, then didn't seem to help much after a week or so.  The IR makes me sleepy initially, then suuuper horny.  I can concentrate when I'm not trying to hump something.  The Ritalin did nothing other than make me feel euphoric the first time.  Both of the Adderall pills give me mild stomach pains/irritation, but not as much as the Ritalin did.  So far, the 2. 5 Focalin seems non existent. I've read that Focalin is supposed to be 2x the potency of Ritalin, but 2. 5 seems low, doesn't it? Anyone else having success with just 2. 5?TL:DR: Swapping meds, started Focalin 2. 5, no improvement. 
Hi	wishes!	Hi guys! Stopped in to see how long it had been.  Badge says 264 days.  Life has been pretty good.  I still have the occasional urge, but I'm happy where I am as a non-smoker, and I'm happy with my choice and progress.  Peace, and best wishes!
So	questions	So I realize I post here a lot - sorry for that. . . I'm in High School.  With that, comes the constant fear of college.  I am so afraid of college.  So how's studying for the SATS?Make sure you pass all your classes!WHAT DO YOU WANNA BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO COLLEGE?I'm so tired of hearing these questions.  Every single time I get asked one of those questions
They	things?	They always seem to be like actions that would be harmful to melike to break my fingers or shove my hands down my throatreally weird stuff that I otherwise wouldn't even think of doingHow do I get rid of these stupid things?
Still	me.	Still haven't heard anything more from Ndad.  Not really worried about it and that's how I can tell I have changed from how I was in the past.  I am hoping that means he has left town and is just working on what more to say to me. 
My	luck.	My husband (daily weed smoker) has been very supportive of me and my decision to quit.  He takes it outside so I don't have to be around it and has helped me get through these withdrawal symptoms as best as he can.  And yet I still feel so distant from him right now.  It was always an activity we did together and we had so much fun with it.  I miss that part.  So I'm not sure if I'm jealous that he still does it or if we are just in 2 completely different lifestyles.  I was wondering if anyone could share with me their perspective on this.  Or link a post that has addressed this for guidance.  I tried searching this sub for it on my own but had no luck. 
I'm	it.	I'm cycling between dissociation and extreme sadness right now.  I haven't felt this low in so long, and that's saying something.  Kidney failure got him, no choice but to put him down.  I miss him so much.  I grew up with him, he was my first best friend.  My other dog doesn't understand what's going on.  Life is too cruel, I can't handle it. 
It's	hard.	It's like grasping at a thought that's floating away. . . anyone else get annoyed with that? Trying to write stuff down the MOMENT I remember but sometimes it's hard.   
And	it.	And it's all my fault.  I slept through elementary school and managed to somehow pass it and now years later i have to suffer the consequences.  I'm not where i want right now, but to get where i want i'd need an proper education.  But for an proper education i need to redo elementary school.  And even when i somehow reach that goal.  Then what? A job that i enjoy is not guaranteed, and i'm completely unable to work at a workplace that is boring and uninteresting.  I feel really behind my peers, i usually don't care about it but it gets to me sometimes, at my age i should have some kind of plan for my career, or maybe even fulfilled it.  
I had to leave	the joke was still going on and I couldn't handle it	Actually I don't know how that title sounds, but I need help figuring it out.  I'm still not sure what happened.  I think 2 of the chat members changed their name and that's it.  I slowly starting loosing sense of what was real. The thing is that I got really confused, like *really confused* and after asking several times to the grup that I needed an explanation about what was going on (I really couldn't decipher)  <e1> I had to leave </e1>  because  <e2> the joke was still going on and I couldn't handle it </e2>  .  After leaving the chat I was in a really altered state. . .  Like I was numb and scared cause I couldn't understand what was going on.  I knew I felt lost and that only increase the anxiety by thousands; and I couldn't calm myself cause the situation on the chat really affected me.  After a while I went to sleep
i get negative feedback attempting to initiate socially	i resort to pretending no one exists in proximity which also leads to more repelled behavior from others	unable to decide whether or not to make eye contact, acknowledge, reciprocate or be proactively social?   <e1> i get negative feedback attempting to initiate socially </e1>   so   <e2> i resort to pretending no one exists in proximity which also leads to more repelled behavior from others </e2>  .  there is no winning here, socialization simply isn't meant for everyone.  there is clear indication not everyone fits the mold for social integration. time to get use to shooting down accusations, complains and discussions in person about the lack of relationships and extroversion or any future in such matters
Obviously	out.	Obviously having anxiety most of the day for many days in a row leads to feeling depressed.  You're just not looking forward to life. But one of my BIGGEST FEARS that caused MAJOR anxiety was a deep down feeling that MAYBE I didn't like life that much.  That I didn't want to even be here.  This wasn't just a hought it was  deeper than that.  Obviously this set off major alarms and anxiety.  My anxiety was trying to tell me. . . I wasn't having fun in life. . . I wasn't enjoying it. . .  so that became my # 1 priorityI made a list of all the things I like to do and made sure I did more of it.  I tried to cut out all the BS.  I treat myself.  I try to have fun.  It takes some effort. In this case I had to treat the depression part to help ease the ANXIETY part.  It's a complex relationship I know. . . but I'm working on figuring it out. 
I was too afraid to work out	elevating my HR would send me into a panic attack	Hey guys! So over the summer I developed really really bad health anxiety.    <e1> I was too afraid to work out </e1>  because  <e2> elevating my HR would send me into a panic attack </e2>  .  Anyway, I've been doing therapy and medication for a couple months and feeling pretty good! I recently began running again.  While I've done Hot Yoga over the past few months, I never felt anxious.  But today I pushed myself while running and checked and I had a 161 HR (which I think is okay for a 22 y/o 5'8 140lb girl?).  I stopped after twenty minutes and while sitting down and resting I felt closer to a possible anxiety or panic attack then I have in a long time.  Eventually it went away though.  But now I'm sort of afraid to push myself in cardio, even though I do want to lose weight.  Should I stop doing running? Or do you guys think pushing myself to the brink of anxiousness and panic might actually help? Thanks for any help guys.  
Yesterday,	needs.	Yesterday, we celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary and she dropped a bomb on me about how she feels so incredibly depressed and lost.  Now I knew about some slight stuff that had shown up during our first 3 months when she was on birth control and has since stopped that.  I'm really at a loss of how to help her.  I asked if she would listen to a therapist and she said no.  I asked if she even wanted to be happy and she wouldn't answer me.  Please, any help would be so helpful right now.  I don't want to lose her to this and I want to be an anchor for her to grab onto when she needs. 
hello	You	hello people, i need help.  i have been really bored and i cant find a hobby todo in my passing time that is HEALTHY for me.  Plz give me some hobbies or ideas i can do in my free time.  Thank You
Looking	driving	Looking for some feedback if those diagnosed or those struggling with the illness went from loving to a complete 180 where you/they than said I don't love you anymore. Did this correlate to any med adjustments or even denial of diagnosis?Currently struggling as my wife/partner of 12yrs cheated and went from apologetic and loving to now resentful and pushing away the last few months.  She has since also done radical things such as drinking and driving
this	need	this unfortunate submitted here recently.  had a mention that resonated with me, about being logical and coming across that way, sometimes exceedingly.  i feel as if it may be a problem with a fear of being vulnerable and expressing with more emotional conviction but instead resorting to a stronger rational type.  perhaps not as strong as suicidal behavior at least not currently, but to do more with less extreme but chronic struggles.  i may be shooting myself in the foot here.  i also suspect this logic approach as some sort of coping style and ultimately an indifference as to harden against more hurt.  without clarity and the whole picture i doubt i'd ever get the help i need
I feel like a failure	I am one	Already 2 years behind, already disqualified from my school once, now on the brink of doing it again.  Had a nervous breakdown coupled with severe depression and absolutely no drive to continue on.    <e1> I feel like a failure </e1> , probably  because  <e2> I am one </e2> .  Don't know what to do anymore.  I'll be a certain failure without a degree but it doesn't seem any less likely that I won't flunk out of school again after wasting thousands of dollars.  So I'm gonna go panic now. 
put me in a room with 3 other people	my anxiety levels are through the roof	I've always been the quiet guy, have struggle with social anxiety my entire life.  However, people that know me say I am one of the most calm and level headed people they know.  I work as a paramedic and rarely feel stressed even during life or death situations, but  <e1> put me in a room with 3 other people </e1>  and  <e2> my anxiety levels are through the roof </e2>  .  It's weird, I'm very confident in my skills, intelligence, appearance etc, but I always have it in the back of my mind that I am being quiet or weird when I am talking to people and this causes my SA to become a self fulfilling prophecy
possibly	don't	possibly a weird question but i like researching my medications and i'm having trouble finding the answer myself. . . so last week i was prescribed lunesta for insomnia and i was warned that half or more people experience a metallic taste in their mouths as a side effect.  took it the first night and yep, tastes like i spent the night chewing on old pennies.  it's gross but manageable but really i'm just curious about why it happens and no matter how i phrase a google search or even if i try google scholar all i find is things saying yep it's a common side effect of these meds and nothing about what exactly the mechanism is or what exactly is going on in my body while metabolizing it that makes it happen.  might be a long shot to ask here and obviously this isn't an urgent concern but i'm just so curious! i don't know enough about chemistry to figure out why lunesta does this when other z-drugs don't
Even	mind.	Even though it's never been more than a week, stopping for a bit wasn't usually a problem, besides the cravings, but now? Geez.  These have always been present,  just never caused issue, I'd just fight through, but a week ago, I had to copy just so I wouldn't throw up.  Tapering off is helping.  Instead of full joints, I roll skinny pinters, or roach sized on hitters.  Not too much of a problem, just sucks to see how this is gone downhill.  Lol, weed sick? Wtf! I work an 10x4 schedule instead of 8x5, so I'll see if I can tough it out on my 3 off days.  At least I can't be sick and depressed in peace.  Not looking for advice  just running my mouth about my drug habit.  But feel free to give some though, I don't mind. 
If	behind	If someone is feeling horrible depressed to the pain where they want to take their own life, why are they called cowards? Why do people always try and guilt people into living in misery?I've had someone tell me before hink how sad'll it make the people you leave behind
i dont have any mental scars or traumatic memories	i dont even know why im depressed	i just got an email from my professor that i failed my trig exam and the class.  im a 20 year old college student trying to get my BS in computer science.  Im not gonna kill myself today but someday i might.    <e1> i dont have any mental scars or traumatic memories </e1>   so  <e2> i dont even know why im depressed </e2> .  i just feel so empty right now i dont know what to do withmyself 
But	Got	But my depressed ass doesn't even care that much.  I really want to be thrilled but people keep saying congratulations and I feel nothing. Edit: can't even spell the title right.  Got
I haven't reset my badge	I always wake up hungover and guilty thinking that one slip up isn't going to reset me	So a week or so ago, I quit smoking.  Full intention of never going back.  And honestly I was doing pretty well.  I got the cravings here and there, but I never seriously considered actually having one.  The bitch is, every single time I have a drink I end up rationalising having one, and do.    <e1> I haven't reset my badge </e1>  because  <e2> I always wake up hungover and guilty thinking that one slip up isn't going to reset me </e2> .  But I'm sat here having got drunk and fucked up for the fourth time now, and it's getting easier to rationalise it every time.  I never enjoy the cig after the first drag or two, but always cave. So what do? Giving up booze at the same time as smoking would be realllly tough.  All my social interactions revolve around booze, and I do use it as a form of stress relief, so honestly I'm just straight up stuck as what to do.  Getting really bummed out that I'm evidently weak willed and constantly fucking up.  Any advice, opinions or hard truths would mean the world, thanks.  TL;DRCan't help smoking when drunk, really like drink, really hate smoking. 
I	much!!	I always almost argue with people whenever they say they think I look/seem better, haha. You sound a bit better today! I'm glad you're doing better!Inside: WELL AKCHUALLY NOT REALLY BUT IM GLAD YOU NOTICED MY FACADE-I don't know why I wanna correct them so much!!
I don't have the best insurance	the nearest psychiatry office that accepts my insurance is over an hour away from me	I'm kind of at the end of my rope as far as I'm concerned and am seeking help for my ADHD.  I had a tentative dx in the past, as well as a dx of MDD, but was only ever treated for the MDD.  Antidepressants did nothing but fuck with my emotions.  The only problem is that   <e1> I don't have the best insurance </e1>  , so   <e2> the nearest psychiatry office that accepts my insurance is over an hour away from me </e2> .  Could I go to my regular doctor and talk to him? Or would he just send me to a psychiatrist any way? I don't want to waste my doctor's time if it's something he doesn't handle. 
It's	up?	It's been fifteen years of this.  Fifteen years and I'm tired and sad and I just want to die, I've tried everything to feel better and nothing works.  I want to hide in my bed and just wait for it to be over.  Why are people so insistent that I get up and fight it? I've tried.  I'm tired.  It's not 'just another bad day', it's a string of them fifteen years long and that's more than half my life.  When am I allowed to just give up? 
I'm afraid of fighting OCD	I'm afraid that it will fight back and hurt someone I care about	How do I know what is real and what is OCD and what reaction of mine is real versus OCD?Plus,   <e1> I'm afraid of fighting OCD </e1>  because  <e2> I'm afraid that it will fight back and hurt someone I care about </e2> .  How do we know that won't happen?
I	wish?	I have many dead relatives and I wish I could trade places with them.  They would appreciate life, and I ache to die. I feel jealous of people with terminal, physical illnesses.  I wish I could have cancer instead, or even in addition to my mental illness. Depression has fucked me up so much I can't even wish for health or happiness.  How horrible is that, to be robbed of something as small and as silly and ineffectual as a wish?
Hi	anymore.	Hi there, my name is Alex and I'm 23 years old.  I've been really depressed these past few days and just wanted to talk to someone about it.  I just need a friend or someone who I can talk to that understands what it's like to feel lost and alone.  I don't know what I'm doing with my life anymore.  
For	stims/depressants.	For as long as I can remember I have always been extremely sensitive to stimulants/depressants.  Stimulants always made me feel very europhic, positive &amp; happy.  I'm talking caffeine, duramine, and yes nightclub drugs.  All of the above seem to hit me harder than everyone else.  On the flip side, depressants have like alcohol, come down after caffeine &amp; party drugs have always left me feeling negative, emotional &amp; suicidal.  Just wondering if I am alone in this? Or if any of you experience similar highs &amp; lows from stims/depressants. 
Asking	I was reading a former addict discussing how she was going through a rough time in her life	By 12-step program, I mean a set of. . .  I don't know, overall to-dos or ideas or whatever that you follow/add on one by one that helps get you from low as can be to functional.   <e1> Asking </e1>  because  <e2> I was reading a former addict discussing how she was going through a rough time in her life </e2>  .  She has a script, like when things are rough
every time I think about last Christmas I cringe	I get physically nauseous thinking of it	 > because <  <e1> every time I think about last Christmas I cringe </e1> .  Inwardly and outwardly.   <e2> I get physically nauseous thinking of it </e2> .  How I drank so much I passed out on the floor before I even finished wrapping presents.  How my boyfriend had to basically beat me to wake me up and make me finish.  How I was so hungover on Christmas morning I basically couldn't even stand to watch my kids open their presents.  And then I planted myself on the couch for the rest of the day.  Miserable.  It was horrible.  Never again.  Never ever ever again.  What if my boyfriend wasn't there? What would my kids have woken up to?  NEVER AGAIN.  I will never be that mother again.  I was a monster.  And now I am thankful for another sober day.  And it will be a Merry Christmas this year.  I will not drink with you all today!
Hey,	ThatOneActor8	Hey, I'm having a fucking awful night, but cut a lot.  Minorily suicidal but not enough to try again.  Just need to talk to someone, we can talk about puppies or play 20 questions.  My name is Rilen. My kik is ThatOneActor8
I knew I had to turn my life around	I quit	Quitting smoking is easy.  I've done it hundreds of time.  Seriously though, I thought I had it down.  July 29th was the going to be the last day I smoked a cigarette.  I had gotten very depressed and sedentary and   <e1> I knew I had to turn my life around </e1> .  So   <e2> I quit </e2>  . At first, it was pretty easy.  I had an e-cig and could hit it at work all the time.  Sure, I quit smoking
i try and do whatever methods to flirt subtly but I just end up looking like a psycho	I get so fucking nervous	  <e1> i try and do whatever methods to flirt subtly but I just end up looking like a psycho </e1>  because  <e2> I get so fucking nervous </e2>  and I can't do anything and just need to get out of where i am, lmao does this happen to everyone in here?
I'm worried	my lack of sexual desire	Hello, For those who have had problems with SSRI amd their libido you know how frustrating it can be, especially when you're in a relationship. I love her and enjoy spending time with her, but   <e1> I'm worried </e1>  because  of  <e2> my lack of sexual desire </e2> .  The problem is that she has a very high sexual drive.  Me on the other hand most of the time would rather do other things before having sex.  I feel this is starting to affect us, and I explained to her the situation but she doesn't quite understand it.  Sometimes she tells me that she thinks it's her fault or that I don't like her anymore.  I know there's people here who has been through this.  Any tips or advices.  
Im not having them	i want to quit them	so I stopped stimulant shit as i used to, video games, alcohol, weed, sex, gore, masturbation.  I feel the struggle now, not being stimulated makes me feel dry sad and fucked up.   <e1> Im not having them </e1>  because  <e2> i want to quit them </e2> , want to know how life is.  Im anxious.  
Hi,I'm	again.	Hi,I'm an addict. . .  I'm currently trying to tapper down from Valium and suboxone (spelling).  I was doing so well. . .  I was down to 3/4ths of the Valium dose, and GAD kicked in hard.  I relapsed on the Valium and now I'm not in a good spot. I have a little left and I'm trying to use what other RXs I have to cope with how I'm feeling.  I'm really scared to tell my GF that I'm back to where I started.  She hates all the pills the doctors give me, but I have had bad GAD since I was 20 (I'm 30 now).  I self medicated until about a year ago when my girlfriend gave me the courage to get help. Now its Christmas night and this 30 year old man is on the brink of tears. .  I'm sorry.  I just needed to post something. . . I've gained 30 pounds in three months.  145 to 175. . .  It's all in my gut.  I look hideous. .   I'm gonna keep trying and keep moving forward. .  when you fall down you gotta back up again.  
Back	:(	Back to square one no job got terminated today after work and just working helped me out through life it made me feel better I didn't think they would let me go after being there for almost a year this is what I get I'm actually the ones that put in the hard work for there stupid company f u Walmart really depressed and down with my self been eating alot to make me feel better I know I can always get a job but I'm going to miss my friends I made :(
I have this chronic empty feeling	I desperately want wife/kids	  <e1> I have this chronic empty feeling </e1>  because  <e2> I desperately want wife/kids </e2>   (a family, basically). . . But I can never put someone else through the dissapointment they would inevitably have after being with me for a while.  I just wouldn't be good enough for them in anyway, and would fail them in every way whether it be from how I look or my dull lifeless personality. 
the life expectancy of those with severe chronic mental illnesses is 25 years less than the average population	she beat the spread	Everyone sees her as Princess Leia, and in a large extent so do I.  But there's more to her than that.  In Stephen Fry's documentary about Bipolar Disorder, he interviews her about her struggles.  It was the first time I saw a celebrity I knew identified as one of us before my diagnosis.  Since then everything I hear and see related to her is cast in that light.  I realize this is to a degree labeling, but it was actually an inspiration.  She made it to 60 years old in this fight.  To many that sounds like an early death, but considering  <e1> the life expectancy of those with severe chronic mental illnesses is 25 years less than the average population </e1> ,  <e2> she beat the spread </e2> .   I have checked myself into the hospital twice for suicidal ideations preceding possible attempts.  I expect that at some point I'll lose the fight and hit that eject button.  But she didn't.  Despite the contributions of her history of drug abuse on cardiac health
Usually I get a drink from a fast food place	some of them have softer ice than others (or ice that's soft and I can chew into a ball)	I just wondered what everyone does to treat their anxiety.  When I'm anxious or stressed, I chew ice.   <e1> Usually I get a drink from a fast food place </e1> , since  <e2> some of them have softer ice than others (or ice that's soft and I can chew into a ball) </e2> , and drink the drink as fast I can to get to the ice.  Sometimes I just pop the lid off and drink/chew.  It just keeps me from focusing on one thing and lets me relax a little.  At some point I'll have to find a different treatment -ice can actually chip away at your teeth- but for now it really helps.  So what are some weird ways you've treated your anxiety?
I really want to stop smoking	Im  tired of feeling like i HAVE to smoke to sleep good or to enjoy a meal	Well guys Ive been smoking literally everyday possible since 11th grade, im 21 now.   <e1> I really want to stop smoking </e1> .   <e2> Im  tired of feeling like i HAVE to smoke to sleep good or to enjoy a meal </e2> .   I feel like my motivation to get ahead in life is at a dead stop because of marijuana.  Possibly the most annoying thing about being a consistent smoker is the memory problems that come along with it, i forget everything.   I've tried stopping before and managed to stop for a week, thats the longest.  Living in Los Angeles doesn't help my problem either, theres medical dispensary's everywhere and meds are cheap here too.  You guys get the point. . . .  anyways to the people that did manage to stop and stay sober or even just slow down on smoking, what worked for you?
a feeling of lagging behind socially	difficulties in social skills	Interesting newly published paper on ADHD.   ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/m/pubmed/28033486/ &gt;ADHD is, I argue, an impairment in sense of time and a matter of difference in rhythm; it can be understood as a certain being in the world, or more specifically, as a disruption in the experience of time and a state of desynchronization and arrhythmia.  Through excerpts of interviews with adults diagnosed with ADHD and observations, I illustrate how impairment in time is manifested in an embodied experience of being out of sync.  I suggest that the experience of ADHD is characterized as 1) an inner restlessness and bodily arrhythmia; 2) an intersubjective desynchronization between the individual and its surroundings; and 3)  <e1> a feeling of lagging behind socially </e1>  due to  <e2> difficulties in social skills </e2> .  In closing, I argue that an increasingly accelerating society is augmenting the experience of being out of sync rather than eliminating it.

I feel as though it's very difficult for me to argue	it seems like before I can fully describe the point I'm trying to make someone has already shot down my idea	It's a lot of of trouble for me to tell somebody they are wrong or to be confrontational.  It drives me nuts.   <e1> I feel as though it's very difficult for me to argue </e1>  because  <e2> it seems like before I can fully describe the point I'm trying to make someone has already shot down my idea </e2> .  I find it really challenging to come up with arguments in the moment.  I feel that this is related to ADHD.  Does anyone else know more about this or had to deal with this issue?
I'm confused	I'm probably more aware in what to do in social situations than most	I see many posts on here related to having social anxiety and not knowing what to do in social situations.  However  <e1> I'm confused </e1>  as  <e2> I'm probably more aware in what to do in social situations than most </e2> .  Maybe it's I have the right mix of hyperactive (talkative) and innatentive (so I don't talk forever ).  Im not too sure, anyone out there with similar?
Man	life.	Man a year ago I was depressed, with a vocally abusive girl.  What having issues with work and was being kicked out.  Fast forward to 1 year after starting to seriously seek treatment.  I'm happy l, have an amazing adhd girlfriend, have a new good job and move into my new apartment with my girl on the 15th.  Not a question but i thought I'd post this so people know l.  With proper treatment and the want to do it.  Life will get better.  And it might even be faster then you expect it.  Happy new year to you and hope you all take 2017 to improve you life.  
There	side	There are a lot of people who will quit for their New Years Resolution.  I encourage all who have quit to help everyone who is quitting to successfully help reach that goal.  Worse comes to worse I'm here to help anyone.  I've been down that road and I can say it's glorious on the other side
I	me.	I know it does not work that way for everyone.  I also don't want to make it seem like l smoke weed all the time.  But I will always be glad that I found something that can help me get control over my anxiety.  I can enjoy living.  I can go a few hours without thinking about hurting myself.  It's been good to me. 
She is incredibly stubborn and arrogant and prideful	stopping her from seeing that she's sick and needs help	I'm the daughter of an alcoholic mother.  We've all been here before--they drink every day sorta thing.  Her moods affect our family.  I'm really scared for her mental and physical health.   <e1> She is incredibly stubborn and arrogant and prideful </e1> , and I feel like that's something  <e2> stopping her from seeing that she's sick and needs help </e2> .  She has been in the denial phase of alcoholism for 15-20 years.  I'll always believe in her, believe than she can get sober.  But as we both get older, it's getting harder and harder to have that attitude.  So I'm curious.  Did your parent(s) ever get sober? How was the process like?
My family loves wine	We make wine, drink wine, talk about wine	Today my extended family celebrated Christmas and the new year together.   <e1> My family loves wine </e1> .   <e2> We make wine, drink wine, talk about wine </e2> .  Everyone has a glass or two.  Except me.  In previous years I would have to be careful not to pour myself more wine when someone was looking who had already watched me pour a full glass.  I hid it really well.  I would get drunk every year.  No one ever noticed or at least never said anything to me.  This year <e3>I was really nervous about going and not drinking</e3>.  Especially because <e4>it's only day 2 for me</e4>.  I thought I would be offered wine and would have to refuse.  I did it though! I drank juice and iced tea today and had a blast.  I remember every conversation I had and it all felt much more genuine.  I did have a little anxiety but it was worth it.  Afterwards I went to the store and treated myself to a plethora of fancy sodas and juices for the days to come.  I can't wait to start having more energy and being sober.  Still very scared but I'm feeling good about it.  
you get to delegitimize this entire space	there aren't normal people here trying to save us from ourselves and enlighten us and teach us the true way to live	Since obviously we depressed people are just helpless souls who need to be saved by the normal people.  Obviously  <e1> you get to delegitimize this entire space </e1>  just because  <e2> there aren't normal people here trying to save us from ourselves and enlighten us and teach us the true way to live </e2> .  They say just be happy
I	days?	I have an extension to my browsers that prevents me from going to certain websites during certain times and days.  Is there anything like that for an iPhone to prevent me from using certain apps during certain times and days?
I'm beginning to get tired, which is a good thing	for so long I went without R. E. M.  Sleep	Today I feel high as hell, dizzy, etc.  I know it's temporary and I was warned but just checking in on here as I do every day.  I also feel super anxious almost to the point of a panic attack, but I'm semi controlling that part just by mind over matter.  Tips? Tricks? Etc or is it all just part of the ride? Either way I'm going to do whatever it takes.   <e1> I'm beginning to get tired, which is a good thing </e1>  bc  <e2> for so long I went without R. E. M.  Sleep </e2> .  See y'all tomorrow! I'll be on throughout day when I can to respond, etc.  Have a great day fellow leavers!!!!
Trying to read more	I'm not smoking myself into a coma every night	 <e1> Trying to read more </e1>  since  <e2> I'm not smoking myself into a coma every night </e2> .   I like it all (well maybe not sci-fi so much but I'll be open minded), fiction, non-fiction, bios, lemme hear your faves! 
I find myself quickly distracted	I don't retain any of the material	I really want to read these books about coding that I got but even when I find the time for them  <e1> I find myself quickly distracted </e1>  so  <e2> I don't retain any of the material </e2> .  What should I do to help me finally sit still and read the damn things? Edit: Just wanted to say thanks for all the posts :)
I'm crying and pissed	I allowed to show enough compassion to call back	I broke down and called my emom tonight after a text and voicemail begging for an explanation dor the TO.  I had told them over a month ago that I wanted space and that I'd contact them when I was ready, which they unsurprisingly didn't respect.  This is after 4mo of weird no-contact where I think they might have had ME in a TO.  How bout them apples, right? Anyway, I stupidly called tonight and got a whole bunch of lying, backtracking, denials, explanations about what was REALLY happening as opposed to what I merely thought was happening - all topped with the usual faaaaamily and unconditional love and not getting any younger bullshit.  Now  <e1> I'm crying and pissed </e1>  that  <e2> I allowed to show enough compassion to call back </e2> .  I feel like an even bigger idiot that  a small part of me thought it would go differently this time. 
2 bottles of wine and 4-5 beers	I woke up filled with regret and disappointment	Last Sunday I had made the decision to finally stop drinking.  I realized I cannot moderate myself.  I don't drink with great frequency, but when I do, I tend to drink all night and oftentimes into the next day.  20+ drinks wouldn't be unusual on a heavy night.  Come Jan 1st, I had 7 days without a drink.  I was feeling awesome about myself- listening to recovery podcasts, lurking on here, etc.  I even made it through new year's eve without a single drop of alcohol.   Yesterday I gave in.  After  <e1> 2 bottles of wine and 4-5 beers </e1> ,  <e2> I woke up filled with regret and disappointment </e2> .  I poured my last 7 beers down the drain and vowed to start anew.  I just wanted to post here as a way to hold myself accountable and introduce myself.  I felt the need to put this in writing in order to wipe my hands clean.  Edit: Wow, I am completely overwhelmed by all of your supportive and encouraging comments.  I did not expect to log in to this tonight.  You all put a huge smile on my face, so thank you!
I want to help and will be looking into counseling for myself	I know I will need to be more supportive and less thanksafuckinglotdick	Hi all.  I'm looking for insight from an insiders perspective.  My so is an alcoholic.  He just got a DUI.  He doesn't understand why I am so angry when he feels I should be supportive.   <e1> I want to help and will be looking into counseling for myself </e1>  as  <e2> I know I will need to be more supportive and less thanksafuckinglotdick </e2> .  My question is. . if you could, what would you tell your loved ones about helping you? Try to Help more, help less, tough love, interpretive dance?? Do you talk about your addiction with your SO? Trying to find a new normal and any insight from someone in recovery would be greatly appreciated! 
I have looked at removing the arms or the chair (I can't see how they can be removed), even buying a new chair (an unnecessary expense)	I have just lived with the discomfort and the irritating banging every time I nudge forward	I am laughing to (and at) myself right now.  For more than a year, I have been working from home.  I have a beautiful office, and have my work space set up exactly as I want it.  The one thing that's been bugging me is that the arms of my office chair bang into the edge of my desk when I move the chair in (I like to be snug and tight into the desk when I work).   <e1> I have looked at removing the arms or the chair (I can't see how they can be removed), even buying a new chair (an unnecessary expense) </e1> , so  <e2> I have just lived with the discomfort and the irritating banging every time I nudge forward </e2> .  Today, for no good reason, I thought My feet aren't flat on the floor
I	times	I wasn't diagnosed or medicated for ADHD until age 30.   I always thought I was just lazy and anxious.  I realized recently that whenever I feel sick, it takes a long time before I believe that I actually am sick.  I'll feel tired and run-down but then I'll think Maybe this is just my ADHD low dopamine/motivation.  A lot of times
I've had a horrible time making eye contact	I have an intense fear of making eye contact that stems from bullying in college	Hi guys, For the longest time,  <e1> I've had a horrible time making eye contact </e1> .   <e2> I have an intense fear of making eye contact that stems from bullying in college </e2> .  It has gotten so bad that it is starting to affect my work relationships.  Every time I make eye contact, I feel incredibly vulnerable and threatened and it comes off as being angry at the other person.  Any tips to help me conquer my fear of eye contact? 
My heart started acting off	feel uneasy at first	I don't know what's going on with me, and I really need help.  About a month ago this started to happen for no reason, and I genuinely don't know what to do.   <e1> My heart started acting off </e1> , and it made me  <e2> feel uneasy at first </e2>  but I just shrugged it off the first time.  (Note: before this nothing was going on with my chest.  No anxiety, nothing.  I only had minor depression).  Nothing too terrible, it just kind of had a large pump.  It made me shutter
I	here.	I thought my suicidal ideation was mainly from the stress of school but I guess not.  I didn't even want to get out of bed the entire break.  I just wanted to go back to sleep.  Please could someone just put me out of my misery.  Every day I fantasize about putting a revolver to my head and pulling the trigger, but I don't even own a gun.  I wasn't meant to be born.  I clearly can't handle life.  Sorry for posting so much.  I know I don't really even deserve the help I get on here. 
I was curious of the differences	I looked up the manufacturer of the CVS kind	I just recently picked up my adderall prescription from a local CVS here in Southern California.  I noticed the prescription that I got at my university's health center and the one from CVS differ in brand.    <e1> I was curious of the differences </e1>  so  <e2> I looked up the manufacturer of the CVS kind </e2>  and it was AUROBINDO.  I also looked at a few subreddit posts here about how bad this generic version is.  Should I be concerned at all? Is this generic brand notoriously bad? Will it work? TL;DR: Is AUROBINDO still bad and ineffective? Or has it improved?
I had a panic attack while boarding a plane recently	had to get off	Hi all,  <e1> I had a panic attack while boarding a plane recently </e1>  and  <e2> had to get off </e2> .  I'm set to fly at least 8 more times this year (including 4x next month) and I'm petrified of freaking out at the airport or on the plane . .  Anyone have tips on keeping panic at bay?
When I was a teenager I thought those things mattered	I do get it	I'm kind of sick of seeing kids posting about how bad their life is.  It's not a contest but god damn getting bad grades in school or getting socially ostracized is tough but it's not on par with legitimately potentially life ruining problems adults have.   <e1> When I was a teenager I thought those things mattered </e1>  so  <e2> I do get it </e2> , but you grow out of those things.  You don't grow out of unemployment and racking up huge bills, you don't grow out of chronic health problems.   I don't mean to belittle anyone's suffering but take a step back and ask yourself if the things you're worried about will actually affect you in 2-3 years
I dropped out of college 4 times	I just had *no clue* what I wanted to do with my life	I was lost.  For the longest time I had no clue what was wrong with me.  My life was one big pile of mess.  I jumped from long term(3 years+) to long term relationship with only a week in-between usually.  None of those relationships ever worked out.  I was so hot and cold.  I would push them away only to pull them back only to push them away again.  Once I had emotionally done my damage, I left and found a new victim.  All while this was going on, I had no priority in life.   <e1> I dropped out of college 4 times </e1>  because  <e2> I just had *no clue* what I wanted to do with my life </e2> .  I skipped out on job interviews constantly and my longest job was held for about 6 months.  I constantly changed my career path but I always lost it and went to something else.  My anger is another issue.  I can go from happy go-lucky to Whoever speaks to me is getting an ear full within the hour.  I can feel depressed and wanting to die
I'm going to my first music lesson soon	I'm so nervous	I was going to post this in a music related community but none seemed to fit.   <e1> I'm going to my first music lesson soon </e1>  and  <e2> I'm so nervous </e2> .  It's simply a lesson but my anxiety is going crazy.  I know once I'm there it'll be fine but still.  And this is something I've wanted to do for at least a year.  I'm nervous about the dumb simple stuff like what door do I go in, should I bring this, what if I sound stupid, etc.  
I	it.	I admit I lurk on a few depression forums and noticed a majority of the commenters were male.  I don't think I've seen one female complain of depression, disorders, or anything of the like yet.  They've always been guys.  We all have problems, but are most girls immune to these problems or what? I've just been really curious about it. 
last couple of months have been (I'm pretty sure now) a pretty chronic depressed episode	I haven't really performed at work and have gained about 30 lbs	I've been pretty stable for about the last three years on a combination of Lamictal and Zoloft, but the  <e1> last couple of months have been (I'm pretty sure now) a pretty chronic depressed episode </e1> .    <e2> I haven't really performed at work and have gained about 30 lbs </e2> , and I kept telling myself I'll feel better after the holidays, just make it to the holidays, and now that they're over I feel completely untethered.  EDIT: misspelled a word
Being denied medication	they think I'll get addicted to it	I'm gonna admit myself for a 5-day stint in a facility.  From what I gather, it'll just be in a wing at the hospital up the road.  Here's what I'm worried about: - Sleeping.  - Delirium.  - The HORRID anxiety I felt trying this on my own.  - Hallucinations.  - Discomfort.  -  <e1> Being denied medication </e1>  because  <e2> they think I'll get addicted to it </e2> .  Are these reasonable? Can y'all relay some stories of YOUR rehab stays? (Also: Before you ask, my insurance will only cover the 5-day stay.  Anything after is in the thousands and I'm NOT a rich lesbo. ) Mad love to this sub.  I hope you guys have some stories that'll hook a sista up with peace of mind. 
I'm in a bad mood	you talked to another woman at work	Me and my boyfriend are trying to maintain a very honest and open communication, which is all fine and dandy.  However, sometimes it feels weird to communicate *everything* without feeling ashamed of what I feel.  Like, to say  <e1> I'm in a bad mood </e1>  because  <e2> you talked to another woman at work </e2> 
I start to get anxious from how I feel and it snowballs.  This week I had a lightly bloody nose each morning	it made it awful to do anything	So I have suffered from anxiety for a couple of years now.  It comes and goes but it doesn't seem to be related to anything that happens in my life.  I had a big dispute with friends and I had exams after that and I didn't have any symptoms.  But in december and this beginning of january it' been horrible.   <e1> I start to get anxious from how I feel and it snowballs.  This week I had a lightly bloody nose each morning </e1>  (probably due to the cold)  <e2> it made it awful to do anything </e2> .  If I was left with nothing to do I automatically monitor my health and pick up on anything.  And the stress causes more symptoms.  Does anybody else have these kind of health anxiety issues? I'm 22 and skinny or just right on the bmi chart, no past illnesses or fractures or anything but I still feel myself worry from the symptoms anxiety gives me.  Sorry for the ramble it helps me out going through it all x)
Hey	attack	Hey all, I know this is a strange thing to say, but I want a panic attack.  Let me explain.  I've quite a few anxiety/panic attacks in the past four years, and usually what happens is that I find myself feeling excessively anxious/depressed for a few weeks at a time, eventually culminating in a panic attack, which sucks, but at the same time, these panic attacks seem to function as an 'outlet' for me, and after them, I have the chance to live for a few weeks with a much more manageable level of anxiety.  However, recently, I've run into an issue.  A few months ago, I started down the slope towards another panic attack, but this time, I did something different.  After a few weeks of anxiety, I started to feel the panic attack coming on like normal, but as it began, I reached out to a very close friend, who helped me to reduce the impact of the attack
i couldnt hold my eyes open when looking into the lens	my eyes would start to burn	Does this happen to anyone here? Its hurting my confidence especially in the workplace. . . i cant hold eye contact for too long, or when im talking to bosses, im always shuffling, blinking, and moving around as they talk trying not to cry.  I wish i could somehow fix this. . . i remember when i was very little , i would have this problem when someone was taking my picture,  <e1> i couldnt hold my eyes open when looking into the lens </e1>  because  <e2> my eyes would start to burn </e2> , and then in college it started happening while maintaining eye contact or when i became conscious of multiple people looking at me such as during a presentation or at a party.  I dont feel anxious other than the fact that i dont want someone to think im crying while im conversing with them, which just exasperates the problem. 
I	bearable.	I just want to be happy like other people. . .  I've been trying for so long to fix things but I have no control.  Other people have control of my life and happiness and they won't change.  I can't be happy.  There's nothing that I can possibly do to make my life happy or bearable. 
To	Godspeed	To end this disastrous addiction once and for all, I had to break this piece of Japanese shit.  I opened it up and cut some of the wires in it and tried turning it on. . . .  It didn't open :))))).  I am now free from this life poising device and no one but my friends will be missing it.  Godspeed
Can	problem.	Can anxiety cause high blood pressure, whenever I go to a hospital the first thing they check is my blood pressure which turns out to be higher than normal, before leaving the hospital my blood pressure goes down to normal so, could it be an anxiety problem. 
This	it.	This is my first post here, Just wanted to know if its common for people with ADHD to get frustrated or angry more easily, I have alot of younger siblings who sometimes piss me off an when i snap at them its usually over small things and i feel like an asshole afterwards.  I don't have anger issues , atleast i don't think, and i'm not constantly cussing people out , i just don't know how to explain it.  
Okay	this?	Okay so I've been on Concerta 18mg release once in the morning for around a month now.  For the first week or so, it worked AMAZINGLY.  Like, I've never been so focused in my entire life.  Around 2 weeks into treatment the effects became miniscule (not sure if this is my metabolism or something. .  I'm 17. ) The effects continued to be really low until today.  I took my pill like I do every morning and went to work, and I was LASER focused on my job.  I've got about half an hour left but I've already finished all of my work.  Is it normal for medication to do this? 
I	thoughts?	I am a collegiate athlete recently  diagnosed with ADHD combined and have started taking Evekeo 10mg.  While it really helps me understand the material in my classes and feel less overwhelmed with the schoolwork, I feel that when I take the meds before practice my energy and competitive spirit that allowed me to succeed in my sport is much lower.  Any thoughts? 
I am worried	ADHD meds are known to blunt emotion/lessen being spontaneity	Do stimulants make you socialize/more fun to be around?  <e1> I am worried </e1>  because  <e2> ADHD meds are known to blunt emotion/lessen being spontaneity </e2> 
This	burnout?	This might not even be my ADHD, but I thought I'd ask anyway.  So I'm going to PAX South in a few weeks and last year my brain was so overwhelmed I bailed halfway through the 2nd day.   I was taking frequent breaks in the afk room between panels and snacking regularly while staying hydrated.   But come day 2 something in my brain was like, get me out of here I'm tired.  I really don't want to waste $ 75 dollars on half the experience again.  TL;DR: How do I avoid convention burnout?
I get lonely	I find a throwback to it, and look through all the happy faces, and. . .  I'm not there	I don't know why this bothered me so much.  Last year I did a play.  I had fun.  I thought that I made friends.  I don't talk any more to anybody I did the play with than I did before: absolute zilch.  Whatever, that's fine, people just don't click sometimes and I don't have any hard feelings about that but god damn do  <e1> I get lonely </e1> .   <e2> I find a throwback to it, and look through all the happy faces, and. . .  I'm not there </e2> .  In the left bottom corner is my shoe, with an outstretched arm erupting from the edge of the shot.  If that wasn't so depressing it would be hilarious.  The person who took the picture didn't think to check for my face or retake it upon seeing my absense.  I was forgotten while I was present.  That or they cropped me out. 
No	me	No matter how much attention I get, I feel as though it's not enough.  I've got a decent group of friends consisting of around 5 people (excluding myself) and I often hear empty promises of how they care and worry for me.  My boyfriend used to pay so much attention to me and tell me how he had unnel vision when it came to me
Ever	yourself.	Ever since my boyfriend took his life last December, I've lost countless friends.  I see their photos and how happy they are without me now.  How he would still be alive if I never happened.  I can't help but think they're right.  Everyone always tells you to live your life for yourself, not for others.  But no one tells you what to do when you don't even want it for yourself.  
I called in sick for today and tomorrow	I can get a bit stronger before having to deal with unpleasant people at work	I go to my room to be by myself when I am cranky and I'm finding this very helpful.   <e1> I called in sick for today and tomorrow </e1>  so  <e2> I can get a bit stronger before having to deal with unpleasant people at work </e2> .  Taking deep breaths often BUT I AM NICOTINE FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Whenever	friends.	Whenever I plan to go out with friends, when the day is approaching I feel stressed out, miserable and anxious.  All I want to do is cancel plans to continue being alone and not confronting the world.  This need is overwhelming the days before going out, and it doesn't stop until I see my friends.  
I'm super scared	It's not only the physical pain ( I could handle that the last time - before the rape), but it's the physical pain paired with flashbacks	HI guys! I (23F) am getting a new IUD Mirena in about 5 weeks.  Do you have tips or tricks to minimize the pain ( except Ibuprofen)?   <e1> I'm super scared </e1> .   <e2> It's not only the physical pain ( I could handle that the last time - before the rape), but it's the physical pain paired with flashbacks </e2>  which I'm afraid of.  Do you know remedies or tricks to minimize the impact? My doctor just told me to take ibuprofen 600mg.  Other people on reddit told me to ask for morfine, but the doctor's assistant told me that they never give that for placing an IUD.  What to do? Love, Dawn 
it made me have horrifyingly vivid trauma related dreams	I had stopped	Dont have many panic attacks anymore except when I'm sleeping.  Talked to doc about this and about my general anxiety and she's hoping prozac might be a fix-all for both problems.  Anyone have experience with prozac helping night terrors? I've taken celexa before to stop panic attacks and it worked but  <e1> it made me have horrifyingly vivid trauma related dreams </e1>  so  <e2> I had stopped </e2> .  I'm very worried that another ssri will do the same.  
thinking about others having casual sex makes me angry and jealous	I want it too	Everyone hates incels. .  I have a lot of similarities with incels and Im guessing i may be one myself. .  The only difference is that I have had sex before.  Right now,  <e1> thinking about others having casual sex makes me angry and jealous </e1> .   <e2> I want it too </e2> . .  And I know a lot of girls are into having casual sex so why cant I seem to get it? My friend told me 10 minutes ago that he kissed a girl multiple times.  Why is he able to do that and I am not?  Ive been told I look good and a lot of people like me. .  I dont get it.  The tought of me being an incel makes it even worst.  I know I come over as really desperate but ill admit that I am. 
Have	brings	Have you ever had an Eureka or lightbulb moment when someone said something to you that really helped you cope better.  Maybe it was your doctor, psychiatrist or therapist; but it could well have come from anyone else.  Or perhaps is an insight that you came up with yourself.  Have you ever had a phrase or thought that you can hold onto at certain times?  Something that when you were in the depths of despair you could recall and maybe see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Sometimes is as if we are in a pit and perhaps some of these ideas are the rungs that help us climb out.  Or maybe you were in the whirlwind of hypo/mania and it helped you stay more in control.  For example, a phrase my psychiatrist gave me and that was useful for a period in my life when I was suffering for not being able to live up to my impossible standards due to bipolar, was Good enough is okay.  So constantly when my thoughts were running away towards the negativity that depression brings
(I.	hole.	(I. e scratching, biting, punching).  I used to cut myself when I was a teen and living in my Nhousehold.  I hadn't self harmed for years.  I thought I was free of it, but lately I've been having explosive outbursts of self-hate.  The worst was after an argument with my SO.  I went upstairs and pretended to do laundry.  I beat my legs with both fists until they were black and had red burst blood vessels.  After I stopped, I was exhausted and regretted it immediately.  I've been feeling numb lately.  Has anyone else done anything similar? How did you stop? I feel like I'm sliding down a big black hole. 
**TL;DR	story	**TL;DR is in bold** I am afraid that I won't receive the help I am looking for when I see the doctor.  I am afraid that I might be fixating on ADD as one of my core issues, when I might not have ADD.  I really need good input on this question.  **I already feel nervous and ashamed going to the doctor to see what I can do. ** Without reassurance from someone before my upcoming appointment, I'm afraid I might not be firm enough about my problems when I do speak with the doctor.  My girlfriend and my parents don't believe in medicating, just coping skills. . .  I've avoided the doctor for years on my issues.  I hope someone will listen to my story
I usually lose my patience before he starts calming down	a fight ensues	Hi, without going into a lot of details, I'd just like to know how to deal with my boyfriend's anger. . . what makes angry people calm down and how to talk to them without making everything into a conflict, even the most trivial of discussions.  I feel he misreads my intentions all the time and always thinks I'm trying to attack/insult/talk down to him.  Even when I'm being mad at him for something, legitly, instead of seeing my reasons for being angry myself, he gets angry himself and usually starts yelling and attacking me and saying that he's entitled to his anger because of either the tone I used or the way I looked at him.  At first I stay calm and try to explain that I didn't mean it the way he thinks I did, but  <e1> I usually lose my patience before he starts calming down </e1>  so  <e2> a fight ensues </e2> .  Doesn't matter what started the argument, every conflict almost follows the same pattern where the only escape from I see is not having said anything in the first place.  I feel I can't bring anything up without him getting angry.  It's just better not to say anything. . . 
I	you.	I am curious to see if anyone has been prescribed Lamictal for anxiety.  I have severe ADHD and my doc said he wants to put me on Lamictal to fix anxiety first.  Anyone have experience with this? Thank you. 
Moving	yet.	Moving to a new city.  New job, new life.  I'm determined to do better this time.  I've been really scared of the idea if medication for a while but I'm going to set up a new doctor and therapist and I feel like medication would help, at least until I'm out of the hole I'm in now.  Could anyone share any experience? I'm really worried about finding out what kind of person I'll be, but it has to be better than this.  My main issues currently having damaged my relationship with my last FP beyond repair after a suicide attempt are more on the psychosis and severe paranoia side of things.  It's making day to day life far too difficult and I don't think I'll be too safe in my own with just DBT (only new to it) yet. 
work stresses	I got really drunk when I got home on wednesday	Well, I've been on celexa for almost 2 years now, and until recently my suicidal thoughts were quite infrequent.  Due to  <e1> work stresses </e1> ,  <e2> I got really drunk when I got home on wednesday </e2> .  I passed out on the couch and woke up several hours later covered in vomit.  I'm not sure how I didn't choke to death.  Anyway now all I've been thinking about is suicide again.  I'm a 31 year old virgin, why wouldn't I be thinking about it?
this point	I'm hesitant to go	Does anyone know if I have to go to rehab if I check myself into a detox facility?  At  <e1> this point </e1> , it's the main reason that  <e2> I'm hesitant to go </e2> .

I rely on cigarettes to keep me calm and I cannot come down from anxiety or stress without the aid of a cigarette	my life is free of any other substance abuse	Hi everyone!  It's been a while since I have ventured into this sub.  279 days apparently! I have not been remotely smoke free for that time.  I have addiction issues aside from smoking.  I'm a regular at AA and for me, smoking is a huge emotional crutch.  Whenever I try to quit, it's obvious that  <e1> I rely on cigarettes to keep me calm and I cannot come down from anxiety or stress without the aid of a cigarette </e1> .  Since  <e2> my life is free of any other substance abuse </e2> 
I	all.	I have auditory and visual hallucinations.  But the auditory are basically with me nonstop, and have been for a long time now.  I can barely sleep, I eat too much to try and distract myself, doesn't work. . .  I can barely function and have to stay inside most days.  Public makes me so anxious and my voices don't like it either.  I'm terrified I'll get caught for something.  When I'm in a car I firmly believe and know people are trying to hit me. . .  I can't explain it.  My doctor has me on abilify 20mg but it isn't working it has never worked and he just keeps pumping up the dosage.  So now my voices have me believing that he doesn't care if it works.  Sorry, it probably sounds like in rambling.  No one understands and you guys seem cool.  Sorry if there are misspellings.  It took like an hour to write a semi coherent paragraph.  I'm so exhausted and tired.  I still know my hallucinations aren't real in hind sight, but when they are happening it's so hard to distinguish what is reality.  Have a good day all.  
My	weight?	My moms friends daughter gained a lot of weight from her anxiety medication.  Im afraid this will happen to me, but Im on effexor, which is an antidepressant.  Do all anxiety meds make you gain weight?
I	PTSD.	I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder Before I got PTSD about 10 years ago.   I had some EMDR but I couldn't afford to finish a course of it and some Equine Therapy, but I couldn't afford to finish a course of that either.  I'm so anxious it's like I'm frozen a lot of time whenever I try to accomplish anything.   I'm also tremendously avoidant which is an articulation of anxiety as well.   I'm a 42 F, life is passing me by.   I have no money, no job, no husband or children, my public assistance was cut off recently and I've been living in my abusive parent's house for the past ten years since I was raped and got PTSD.

I'm very hesitant to take any pills	I tend to have bad reactions and come from a long line of heavy drug users	Medical marijuana was just legalized in my state.   <e1> I'm very hesitant to take any pills </e1>  because  <e2> I tend to have bad reactions and come from a long line of heavy drug users </e2> .  I'm 30 and have never used pot before.  But I'm wondering if it will help with my anxiety.   It has been so bad lately that it's effected every aspect of my life.  If anyone has had success with cannabis oil or whatever please let me know.  I'd rather take a natural approach and avoid any complications with pills.  
the smoke monster almost got me again at a party	I was a bit tipsy and let down my guard	Just wanted to wish everyone luck on their journey and stay vigilant,  <e1> the smoke monster almost got me again at a party </e1>  because  <e2> I was a bit tipsy and let down my guard </e2> .  Always be careful around smokers dont fall for the trap, I would have been utterly pissed if I fell for it. 
The thought of killing myself is giving me a feeling of comfort	I can always off myself in the event that I no longer want to continue living	My life fell apart in a span of weeks and I am now at the the open wherein the only things I have yet to lose are the clothes on my back and the roof over my head.  Problems came one after the other and I can no longer cope up with the stress included with it.   <e1> The thought of killing myself is giving me a feeling of comfort </e1>  in the sense that  <e2> I can always off myself in the event that I no longer want to continue living </e2> .  And lately, that option is becoming more and more enticing.  
I feel exhausted	I have to force myself to do things everyday for my children	I feel like I'm getting worse.  Everything takes a great amount of effort, even just changing the channel for my children.  I don't even have the motivation to shower.  I'm lucky if I get 4 hours sleep a night.   <e1> I feel exhausted </e1>  because  <e2> I have to force myself to do things everyday for my children </e2> , and I feel guilty that it's forced.  I feel like I'm on a downward spiral and I just can't breathe.  I don't know what to do anymore. 
I	&lt;3	I ask as I wondered years ago if I was a form of Bipolar, with a side of Anxiety for bad luck, as I would have a mass of ideas, spend money on it and then. . .  never get anywhere.  Now I'm relatively stable (150mg Sertraline p/day - not Bipolar, we think!) I'm getting all these ideas (again) and I never finish them, or intend to, but just don't I don't know if it's the anxiety of not being good enough (could talk about that for a while; my upbringing was a slight problem there) or that things snowball, in that if I don't finish my first project, I feel guilt about it and then I get anxious and can't work on it, which gives me more guilt and more anxiety. . .  you get the idea.  Does anyone else suffer from this, and if so, how do you overcome it (even on a small scale)? &lt;3
Been	guys?	Been playing on and off for six months now, Its been good ive been learning alot and can pick out certain notes by ear.  I cant stay dedicated to the guitar at all though and I often play it for one hour until my extremely short attention span ruins everything.  The thing is that i want to learn music but its so hard with ADHD i cant focus on anything to save my life. . Any advice guys?
I'm	adult?	I'm 21, should be a carefree happy college nursing student.  Yet I feel stagnated, I feel like I'm stuck between being a kid and an adult.  I'm mature, I'm smart, etc, but I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of adult and kid.  What can I do to feel more like an adult? 
I have nobody to tell my shit to	I am too afraid to open up myself even a little bit	 <e1> I have nobody to tell my shit to </e1> .  I have friends.  I have family.   <e2> I am too afraid to open up myself even a little bit </e2> .  I had bad experiences the only times i could open myself up a bit.  I can't even cry since 2015. . .  I am so stressed, and trapped. . .  and fucked up. . .  in everything. . .  i don't even know in what i am fucked up. . .  
I	done?	I think I'm killing my mom.  No matter what I do I'm making her feel bad.  She spends all day worrying about me and texting/calling me to make sure I haven't killed myself.  By staying alive I'm making her suffer, but if I kill myself she'll probably kill herself too.  I want her to feel better.  How do I pretend to be happy without coming off as fake? How can I make her keep living when I'm done?
I	days.	I can't find a break.  I'm always anxious about the pointlessness of life.  And it fucking sucks.  I can't live like this.  I don't know what to do.  Fuck this.  Life is so stupidly pointless and worthless.  All my loved ones and myself will die and it'll all be for naught.  And I think about this constantly, along with my depression and brain fog that won't quit, will all the medications and therapy.  Should I see a neurologist? I head back to college in 2 days.  
I feel guilty	she is the one suffering, not me	To keep a very long and painful story short.  Someone I know was severely injured in one of the European isis attacks in the last year.  I have been diagnosed with severe OCD a couple years ago.  I take medication which has helped me a lot with everyday compulsions.  I am keeping details vague to protect her identity and mine.  I think about it every day even though it was months ago.  I am crying now writing this.  I think about her pain, the day it happened, her family, her future, then I think about how the situation is causing me pain and then  <e1> I feel guilty </e1>  because  <e2> she is the one suffering, not me </e2> .  This then repeats every second of every day.  Over and over and over again.  When I wake up to when I go to sleep I think of nothing else.  I feel like I am in a prison in my own head.  I feel helpless.  I am not even sure why I am posting this, but maybe if someone who understands what I am going through sees this that would be good.  Thanks
I	crazy?	I know everybody who has OCD and anxiety thinks they're losing they're mind or atleast a lot of people are afraid of it, idk  why I feel like I'm any different or more likely to lose my mind but I keep having these freaky bizarre detached like not even fully thoughts that just attack me. . I can't even explain them, and I try to think myself out of thinking of that makes sense. . and I just don't get it.  How can I shut this out and not feel crazy? 
It's a struggle every day for me not to down a bunch of pills and end this	I don't see any other way out	My life feels like it's over already, and I think I'm just fighting a losing battle.   <e1> It's a struggle every day for me not to down a bunch of pills and end this </e1> , because  <e2> I don't see any other way out </e2> .  I'm to stressed all the time to function as a normal person; I've stopped working, I skipped my first week of classes, and I've just been drowning myself in as much escapism as possible.  How do I do this? How do I fight through the stress, and the pain, and the constant self doubt, to finally be the girl I've always wanted to be? People in my position already have a horrifyingly high rate of suicide, so what's one more drop in the bucket?
I	directions	I got him today, he's a Great Dane named Nebula.  We played for about 45 minutes and then he slept on my lap for an hour.  Im picking him up on Thursday.   I'm very confident in the dog choice and I'm very happy to see my life moving in a good directions 
I	it.	I was passively diagnosed with ADHD inattentive type.  I feel like I have a problem where I don't seem to have a strong sense of momentum.  When I smoke cannabis I suddenly feel like i have activated some sort of GPS navigation device.  I remember feeling like this a little when I tried Adderall but I have always wondered if I was just high from it.   I feel like I don't have a lot of momentum when it comes to doing things.  The boat is there, the sails are open but I just don't have any wind cognitively.  Like if every day I have to plant a new garden instead of going to bed and waking up to the progress from before.  I feel like I'm always starting over.  I could go on and on but I definitely feel physiologically different in a way that involves planning and follow through when I've try cannabis and I think I had that feeling on Adderall.  Also I may sort of have sleep apnea.  I got a machine but I would just wake up every night gasping for air while using it.  
Anxiety	group!	Anxiety is tough and most people in our life probably don't understand half of what we go through.  I just downloaded the app Discord and wouldn't mind adding some people who are down to voice chat amongst a group of likeminded individuals.  I know the app is commonly used for gaming but I think it would be a good way to get together, chat in real time, and maybe make some friends along the way.  Leave your usernames below and I will add you to the group!
I cant seem to get help	im too scared, ive gotten so close and had so many opportunities but I give up at the last minute	I really dont know what to do.   <e1> I cant seem to get help </e1>  because  <e2> im too scared, ive gotten so close and had so many opportunities but I give up at the last minute </e2> .  Its affecting everything in my life right now and those around me and I really want it to end.  What good would getting help get me, won't I just end up where I am now and be depressed all the time? How would I even get better? can I?
I	.	I don't feel anxious today (yay!).   But it is now replaced with crippling depression.  I rarely experience both at the same time.  I can so clearly feel the difference.  They just seem to cycle back and forth.   Ugh. . 
I	me?	I was doing fine at first, walked here even! I was proud that I was able to do that much. . . .  I have not been out on my own like this in I do not remember how long.  Now I am getting unreasonably scared.  I took a Hydroxizine but it feels like it's getting worse.  I am about to cry, I was doing so well too!! Someone talk to me?

Hi	Thanks.	Hi all, Our insurance switched at the new year and my monthly price for Concerta 54mg just sky rocketed from $ 10/mo to $ 272/mo.   Going to call my doc in the AM to switch to another long acting / extended release variant, but curious what I should request to switch to.  I know some newer meds are out there now so I imagine they have discount cards to offset the price.   Any options on Aptensio XR, Evekeo, others?  I've tried other in the past but ultimately found Concerta to work the best.  Went through Adderall XR, Vyvanse, Strattera (headaches), Ritalin LA and maybe one or two others.   Thanks.  
I feel I'm letting down myself and a lot of people who care about me	I drink	I'm a 23 year old male who started drinking at the age of 15.  I usually get hammered every weekend but in the past three months things have gotten worse, I'm drinking practically every single day.  I work as a cook in a restaurant and I really love what I do but somehow I'm not happy with my life at the moment.   <e1> I feel I'm letting down myself and a lot of people who care about me </e1>  and that's the reason why  <e2> I drink </e2> , to avoid reality.  Any suggestions?
I get so overwhelmed	my lack of background knowledge	I am a psychology major with five classes left until graduation, including the three classes I am enrolled in this quarter.  I am enrolled in physiology to fulfill my biology psychology requirement and anxiety is holding me back.  It's the most science-y class I've taken and since the first class it has been over my head.  I quickly realized it was going to take a lot of work outside class. .  but every time I sit down at the library I look at the book and my notes to teach myself,  <e1> I get so overwhelmed </e1>  by  <e2> my lack of background knowledge </e2>  and understanding that my breath gets shallow, I start sweating and lose focus.  This has happened a dozen times and the midterm is now a week from today and I have no more time to waste.  How do I not let anxiety get the better of me in the library? I don't think it is a problem of capability.  
I've met less than a handful of people, total, who either can't drive or learned to drive late in life	growing up in an urban area with plentiful public transit or just some personal fear or dislike of driving	This question, which I see here often, made me think:  reddit. com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5pscgq/question_any_other_infantilised_acons_here_who/ I wasn't taught how to cook, drive, swim, do laundry, or a million other things that the kids I knew took for granted, and they were always incredulous or seemed to think I was an idiot for not knowing these things.  But I realized that I haven't met ANYONE else like this in real life!  <e1> I've met less than a handful of people, total, who either can't drive or learned to drive late in life </e1> , and that has always seemed to be a result of  <e2> growing up in an urban area with plentiful public transit or just some personal fear or dislike of driving </e2> .  I don't know anyone whose parents purposefully kept them from driving when they were desperate to learn, much less threw fucking tantrums about them using oo much laundry detergent or how they were going to break all the dishes if they tried to make food for themselves.  Or do ACONs just not talk about it because it's too painful to be exposed like this?
Hey	two.	Hey everyone, I work in mental health and I have a few people I work with who have BPD.  I have a theory I'm testing out about MBTI and cognitive function usage with regards to BPD.  If anyone is sure of their type, would you mind letting me know what it is? I'd be happy to respond in private messages with the theory and how it could apply to you.  Thanks everyone!  EDIT: Thanks for all the responses! I'll try to get around to everyone and do a general update with what I've learned from hearing people's personal experiences and reactions to my ideas.  I'll try to get that taken care of over the next day or two. 
So,	me!	So, don't know if anyone else here has heard of Daniel Amen.   Apparently he specializes in treating ADHD.   I've been horribly, terribly, disgustingly impulsive lately.   BAD.   One of those impulses has been looking at reddit, including my fav group of internet strangers (that's you).   I followed a link and wound up in YouTube land, watching a [TEDx talk by Dr.  Daniel Amen]( be/esPRsT-lmw8) He's got a 30-week course.   I'm hoping the whole thing isn't BS.   If I don't lose interest, I'll let you guys know how it goes, if you're interested.   In fact, part of the course is to keep a journal.   So, if anyone wants to see what it's all about, I can journal here.  Here's to hoping this impulse purchase doesn't come back to bite me!
I'm constantly bored	I just pick up areas of study and I improve myself and take on projects to mentally detach myself from my workplace	I'm twenty and I make $ 17/hour full time with optional overtime with benefits, but I'm just a corporate cog turning dramatically slow in a machine doing nothing all day everyday.   <e1> I'm constantly bored </e1>  so  <e2> I just pick up areas of study and I improve myself and take on projects to mentally detach myself from my workplace </e2> .  Last week I picked up hobby electronics and studied that at work, and worked through some chemistry material.  This week I applied my chemistry knowledge and now I'm moving onto social psychology.  All this stuff is just so captivating and I'd love to spend the whole day gathering knowledge and implementing it into my life, but I have a job that bores me to tears instead.  Is this my ADHD? I'm hoping that I can get a magic pill and some CBT that'll make my job bearable enough that I don't detach myself 3/4ths the time I'm here.   EDIT : I AM DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD, IM NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSES.  I'm more concerned with figuring out if this is just something neurological or if my job is just not suited for me.  
I gave my 3 scripts for the next 3 months to 1 grocery store	now they have them	I've been on Vyvanse for a while, but just got switched to adderall today.  Anyway when I looked at the pills I was given it turns out I got the shitty generics from Aurobindo that everyone hates.   I was given 3 scripts for 3 months and gave them all to the pharmacist at a certain grocery store where I usually pick up my meds.   For next month, I want to get a better brand. .  What can I do? Can I have them give me the other 2 scripts back so I can take it elsewere to get a better brand? Is a prescription written explicitly for that generic so that I wouldn't be able to get the better ones? TLDR:  <e1> I gave my 3 scripts for the next 3 months to 1 grocery store </e1>  so  <e2> now they have them </e2> .  Turns out they only have the shitty brand adderall.  Am I screwed until I see the doctor again or can I somehow get those scripts back to go get it filled somewhere else? Thanks 
I	you.	I can't stop feeling like complete shit and I keep trying to do anything at all to put my suicidal thoughts aside but eventually I'll be overwhelmed with idiotic feelings until I  just give up whatever activity I was doing and start wasting time crying or just generally moping around in self-pity.   I'm running out of ways to distract myself and I'm starting to worry for my safety.  I know it's stupid but would anybody be able to help divert my attention away from killing or hurting myself for just a moment today? Thank you. 
I	cadet.	I am going nowhere with my current psychiatrist.  I have tried dexamphetamine, vyvanse, bupropion, ritalin with no avail.   Vyvanse just makes me really happy and full on antidepressant effect.  Wellbutrin was the tad same but gave me so much anxiety.  Ritalin made me irritable.  Dexamphetamine did nothing.   I have trouble with verbal registration.  If they start explaining, then I'm spaced out.  I'm a real space cadet. 
I'm the only person who knows any of this, and its kind of taking it's toll on me	I'm constantly worried that he will start doing more and more	My friend has had depressed phases for a few years, all of different intensity.  Recently he has started cutting his arms to distract himself.   <e1> I'm the only person who knows any of this, and its kind of taking it's toll on me </e1>  because  <e2> I'm constantly worried that he will start doing more and more </e2> .   How do I get him to actually tell this to his family or at least get him to consider to start seeing a therapist?
I don't remember a lot especially about when I cycle in and out	I couldn't really explain to you or tell you when my last episode was and what happened	It sounds crazy, but after months of being depressed I finally feel normal again.  I love it, I feel stable (even though I still have rough days), but sometimes I miss some aspects of being hypomanic.  Like the euphoric feeling.  I know that I am a naturally happy person, but now I am confused if me being happy was truly how I am or bipolar.  Side note:  <e1> I don't remember a lot especially about when I cycle in and out </e1>  so it's pretty blurry.  So  <e2> I couldn't really explain to you or tell you when my last episode was and what happened </e2> .  Yea, anyways do you guys feel like that?? I just feel like I was happier and better at trying new things. 
I'm worried	my midterms are coming up very soon	Right now I am on Concerta, I am on 18 mg and I feel like this is too low but dose.  Before I was on 10 mg of Ritalin two times a day and that helped a lot.  i am in this strange in between place where I find it very hard to study but at the same time feel better than when I am off medication.  Has anyone else been in the strange in between dose? The kind of makes me feel sort of confused,  <e1> I'm worried </e1>  because  <e2> my midterms are coming up very soon </e2>  and the soonest appointment I can get to see a doctor to raise my dose is like two weeks so I ended up getting myself a tutor and I'm hoping that helps. 
The	mind.	The holidays involved a few resets and I'm trying to learn from the experiences.  I am just happy to be back at 30 days with a clear mind.  
I feel I should have died 5-15 years ago at the top of my game	People would have mourned the bright, lively lad I was	 <e1> I feel I should have died 5-15 years ago at the top of my game </e1> .   <e2> People would have mourned the bright, lively lad I was </e2> , but now no-one will care or have anything nice to say about me. 
I've just lost all drive to do anything	I don't enjoy living	That was the best title I could think of.  But living isn't that appealing to me.  Like you're born and you're forced to do all these things in life and live up to these expectations and that's just not for me.  I live a comfortable life and know the value of working hard to live comfortably but just between school, personal life, and expectations that I will face further down the road life has just grown to be a pain.  I'm not on the edge of killing myself but  <e1> I've just lost all drive to do anything </e1>  because  <e2> I don't enjoy living </e2> .  Just curious to see if there were others who thought this way.  I don't know, maybe I'm being a bitch but I couldn't possibly force life on someone.  There's just too big of a chance of it being shitty. 
I was then bullied abit in highschool which affected me badly	my nature to take things seriously	I am a 21 year old aussie male.   I have just started antidepressants for anxiety-- I am a senstive, nervous and insecure person by nature.   <e1> I was then bullied abit in highschool which affected me badly </e1>  because of  <e2> my nature to take things seriously </e2> .  I have general anxiety, panic attacks, social anx etc, am trying to reduce this.  Question is : am i the way i am (quiet, nervous) due to a chemical imbalance or is it due to my experiences. .   Also will it change my personality? Thanks alot  
A	love.	A child can grow up in poverty, in a bad area, with parents that get mad sometimes, a dad that never learned to hit a baseball or a mom that can't cook, or a whole host of other things.   As long as they grow up with love, that's all that matters.   Just make sure they know you're there for them, and that they don't feel empty and alone.   After that, anything is just gravy.   Just love them unconditionally.   If you can do that, you will have broken the cycle.   And if you can do that, you've won.  You don't need to hold yourself to some TV parent standard.   You don't have to hold yourself to the ridiculous standard you set for yourself.   Just give your kids the one thing your parents weren't able to give you, love.  
Thanks	hallucinations	Thanks in advance for listening.  I've always just considered myself a weird smart guy with a vivid imagination.  However as I head into my 20's (I turn 22 this April) I've begun to be paranoid that I have schizophrenia.  But I think, maybe I should just live with it.  I don't want treatment, and I don't want to have to deal with the stigma.  However, I have these odd beliefs.  Maybe they are delusions, but I think they are true! I think that I can change the entire world just by believing.  Like literally the entire world.  I think anyone could do this but I think I'm especially prepared to be the one the world needs.  Sometimes in life I walk around fully inspired by this idea, then sometimes I doubt it and I'm like wtf was I thinking this is insane I've only had a few hallucinations
Thanks	Goodbye.	Thanks to all of you, I'm now feeling better.  I've never received so much attention in my life.  And if you (the person reading this) are suicidal or depressed, just tell someone.  Your parents, someone you trust.  I posted a bit of my experience in life, and with a bit of attention I feel great again! Don't be afraid to tell someone.  It will help.  I'm no longer going to post on this subreddit (until i get depressed.  again. ) Goodbye. 
I can't see a therapist also	there is a stigma in my country and i worry about not being able to find another job	I work in a high stress environment where things move quickly and have to send emails to high-level bosses.  My immediate boss can be impatient and lately I feel I have been letting her down.  She has been getting snappy about my mistakes.  Doesn't help that a lot of shit keeps happening with my projects that a beyond my prevention.   Earlier in my job I have had massive panic attacks where I almost puked and cannot breathe.  It took a lot of practice to shift my mindset and thinking.  Unfortunately it is starting again, and it is getting harder to stop the paranoia and spiral downwards from beating myself up.   I just feel so alone in this.  There isn't someone I can speak to about this at work.   <e1> I can't see a therapist also </e1>  because  <e2> there is a stigma in my country and i worry about not being able to find another job </e2> .   I feel I can still cope and work on the mindfulness exercises, but I just need to share so I don't burst.   What are some of the things you do to help when you have anxiety?
Obsessive	anxiety.	Obsessive thinking has made me even more anxious than before.  But it's near bedtime, and hopefully I can sleep not too late.  I really hope my meeting with my psychiatrist is soon, taking medication would really help out my anxiety.  
after talking to my therapist about it we figured I should just go	I'm going to but the tickets this week	So I'm sure this may sound stupid to some of you but my family and I are taking a trip to Florida in a few months and staying 4 days at Disney.   I really didn't want to go and  <e1> after talking to my therapist about it we figured I should just go </e1>  so  <e2> I'm going to but the tickets this week </e2> .   Thing is I still can't get over how anxious it's making me! I suprizingly asked for the time off work no big deal and I'm excited to go to the beach and relax but Disney for 4 days just make me want to cry.   All I can think of is the crowds and how tired I'm going to be and having a massive panic attack.   The last two days we will be staying at a hotel so I can go back after I've had enough but I just feel like it's a lot of money for my anxiety to get in the way but my family really wants me to go.  Long story short is I'm going to Disney for 4 days and I'm scared of my anxiety making it horrible for me. 
Im	advance!	Im currently in highschool and am curious to how you guys take your tests and not make mistakes.   For example in math i know all the questions and i understand it but i always somehow make a careless mistake which costs a lot of my grades.  I double check it after the test but still manage to make mistakes i cannot see.  How do you fix this?  Thanks in advance! 
Had	some.	Had anyone here dealt with or is still dealing with addiction? It's a sensitive subject but I feel like ending up in the hospital with my family around me absolutely devastated was one of the best things that's ever happened to me.  Sounds ironic, but it was a wake-up call to change.   I'm 1 year sober and change.  It's work in progress.   How about you guys? I'm new to the community here but everyone is hella supportive.  Maybe this can be of help to some.   
Hopefully	life.	Hopefully today will be better.  I wish everyone here a happy life.  
I'm a recent addition to this sub-reddit	I was only diagnosed this year at the age of 26	 <e1> I'm a recent addition to this sub-reddit </e1> , as  <e2> I was only diagnosed this year at the age of 26 </e2> .  I was super hesitant to try medication, and actually cried in the car when my psychiatrist suggested we look into ADHD.  Now? I can't believe it.  It feels like my mind is more precise, and that fogginess I've been complaining about since childhood is gone! It's like wearing glasses for the first time.   I feel slightly silly that I fell under the radar for so long.  People suggested it as a joke (since I'm a chatterbox and a perpetual distraction-chaser) but for it to be serious. . .  wow.  What are some of the moments were you look back at your undiagnosed moments and go, aha!? **TL;DR? What are the obvious ADHD symptoms you ignored previous to being diagnosed?**
not everyday	I only use it on work days/school days	Hi guys, I'm 20 years old and I've recently been diagnosed with ADHD and I've been using adzenys 9. 4 mg I've taken 5 pills, but  <e1> not everyday </e1>  since  <e2> I only use it on work days/school days </e2> .  I only have classes 3 days in the week and I took 1 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  When I took one this morning and on Wednesday I don't feel the effect anymore.  Did I already develop a tolerance or was the dosage not signifiant enough to start with? Should I try something else maybe? I feel like it was working perfectly, I didn't have any withdrawals or anxiety or any of the other side effects most people get when you start coming down from it.  And I was definitely able to focus much better than normal, but now when I take it, I feel like my same old self when I'm not on the medication. 
I	help.	I have horrible time paying attention, was diagnosed, recently got aptensio 20 mg.  It made my heart race and anxiety spike.  Even at 5 mg, i felt it and i got no pleasure from doing anything.  Its scary, but i want to be able to concentrate.  Any tips? I start a day, get depressed and stopped and decide i need it.  Please help. 
I'm	:(	I'm in such a bad place right now.   I'm worried about dying every minute of the day.  At the point where I can't handle being alone, and even if I am with someone 24/7 I still can't tame the anxiety.  I have panic attacks frequently and I don't know what to do! Anyone else in this situation :( 
I can remember being slapped once or twice by nMom as a kid a long time ago	whenever she's in the room, walks by me, or especially is behind me, I have this kneejerk, gut fear she's going to hit me	 <e1> I can remember being slapped once or twice by nMom as a kid a long time ago </e1> , but otherwise she's never been physically abusive.  Yet  <e2> whenever she's in the room, walks by me, or especially is behind me, I have this kneejerk, gut fear she's going to hit me </e2> .  This is almost impossible to explain to people.  She's generally the rattle pans, yell randomly, slam doors type; she often threatens to slap me and never does, but I've always been afraid she's going to just sucker punch me in the side of the head sometime out of the blue.  This is one of those things that makes you think you're going crazy.  *She's never actually hurt you
I quit cold turkey and I almost want to take a small dose	to hopefully make it less rough on my brain	I've always gotten somewhat depressed my whole life especially in the winter but this has seriously been the worst I've ever had and i didn't even know if it was really the kratom.  I have no motivation, it's hard to make myself do homework and go to work daily.  I just want to lie in bed all day and watch Netflix and not move.   <e1> I quit cold turkey and I almost want to take a small dose </e1>  just  <e2> to hopefully make it less rough on my brain </e2> , but then again it'll probably just make it last longer. . My plans was to get off of the plant for daily use and maybe use it once or twice on the weekends but at this point I'm scared to ever use it again. . Yet I consider a small dose to help me enjoy my weekend before I go back to my miserable job.  This stuff has made me so mentally weak, I have so much more clarity after quitting, the physical withdrawals were gone after the 3 day was over, but I don't know how long I can take this depression for. 
So,	helps.	So, We've known for a while that my youngest sister had some problems with alcohol, but recently learned that it's a lot more involved (daily drinking, some other drugs).  She makes virtually no money and would have easily qualified for free or cheap health insurance, but of course she didn't apply in the open enrollment period.  She was just recently fired from a job, where I don't believe she had insurance either.   (I'm not sure if this would be deemed a qualifying event if she didn't have coverage).  Best options at this point?  Should we even look into rehab centers in other countries to keep costs down?  I could see this end up costing $ 5-10k here in the USA without coverage.  She's in the chicago area if that helps. 
I find it very sad	I will maybe never experience this	Have you ever asked yourself, what an average person without sa would do in a certain situation? How do they feel, what would they say? Is it awkward if I'm laughing in this situation? Should I do x before y, or y before x? Should I do any of these?  <e1> I find it very sad </e1> , that  <e2> I will maybe never experience this </e2> .  It's not just the social anxiety, I feel like it's a whole different mindset and way of living.  How will I ever know if I'm thinking too much, when I never know how much hinking is normal? I don't know if this makes any sense

That's why  <e2> I medicate regularly,  and am not ashamed in the slightest </e2> .   I started adderall when I was 14 and now I'm 23 in grad school.   Don't fall into the trap of feeling bad for being drug dependant.   You can achieve your dreams and getting there by any means necessary is what matters.    I love you all 
I've started to follow along with Bob Ross's videos using MS paint	I don't have the money for oil painting	 <e1> I've started to follow along with Bob Ross's videos using MS paint </e1>  (because  <e2> I don't have the money for oil painting </e2> ) and it's amazing.  It cools me down and now I watch a video, get some work done, maybe watch another.  Even listening to him helps my view of life.  No mistakes, just accidents that I can work with.  Life lessons are taught through painting. 
So	this?	So it's been awhile since I've checked in.  I honestly don't know if it's cravings that im having or depression.  It's so back and forth it's ridiculous.  I find myself feeling fine one second and bad the next.  I wake up feeling on top of the world and as the day goes on in slowly start to feel a little anxious and worried for no reason.  It's hard to explain really, I just go through it like the second half of the day until I finally Wine Down around 11pm.  I know I'm not going to pick up a cigarette over it but it's just an odd feeling.  Anyone relate to this?
she started telling me about what they are learning about in her uni course	I literally fell asleep within minutes	As long as something is somewhat interesting or fun I am fidgety and restless.  But as soon as I get understimulated or bored I start feeling very drowsy and have to fight to keep my eyes open, even if I've gotten a full nights sleep.  This weekend I met a friend that I haven't seen in ages and we were catching up and I was feeling energized as heck, but then  <e1> she started telling me about what they are learning about in her uni course </e1>  (physics) and  <e2> I literally fell asleep within minutes </e2> .  Anyone else? How do you tackle this? I've tried coffee but it doesn't work and it honestly makes me even sleepier sometimes. 
I don't know what medication	I'll settle on, I can't be 100% sure of a plan if it excludes medications	I live in BC, Canada.  I have BC Medical, and I qualify for BC Pharmacare.  Under BC Pharmacare, ADHD drugs are covered for people aged 18 and under only.  I'm older.  - Blue Cross has a plan for $ 32/month that appears to cover 80% of prescription drugs that Pharmacare does not cover, up to $ 1000/yr.  I will have to contact them to clarify if they cover ADHD medications for adults.  - **Is anyone else familiar with ADHD coverage in BC, Canada, for an adult?** - (I'm in an awkward phase where I'm paying out of pocket before I find something that works -- since  <e1> I don't know what medication </e1>   <e2> I'll settle on, I can't be 100% sure of a plan if it excludes medications </e2> A802. )
When I sang it I really mean I half assed it and hummed	I didn't want to be too loud	I sang the happy birthday song to myself in a Dennys over a cheesecake.    <e1> When I sang it I really mean I half assed it and hummed </e1>  because  <e2> I didn't want to be too loud </e2> .   The only happy birthday message came from my 7 year old sister.   I've never had any real friends or anyone I felt I could just lean on.  People say writing it out helps but it doesn't.  I guess opening up here is the best thing I could really hope for.  It's like a tidal wave you know.  Its a little ripple at first, waking up to no one happy you've made it to another year of existence.  And then after that, its just everything all at once.  It's never too much at least not yet but it's just there. 
I get 3-5 hours of sleep mainly	the crying	I've been going through depression for a while.  Some people would say that everyone only says it so they could get attention.  Thats not the case.  Its so bad that the thought of dying comes to my mind everyday.  I havent showered in a week.   <e1> I get 3-5 hours of sleep mainly </e1>  because of  <e2> the crying </e2> .  I barely eat (not the anorexic type).  Instead of being the smart, cheerful girl I used to be, I'm getting D's everywhere in my report.  It's my family.  I love them and all but they are always comparing me, forcing me to do things for them, not listening to me when I want to be serious, and my brothers cant care less about me.  I haven't told anyone, but the only thing getting me through it is my friends.  But I only see them a few days a week and I cant even go out and enjoy things like them.  No one cares about me.  Everyone is ignoring me.  But let me ask you something, Would they really care?
What	see?	What if everything around you Isn't quite as it seems? What if all the world you used to know Is an elaborate dream? And if you look at your reflection Is it all you want it to be? What if you could look right through the cracks Would you find yourself Find yourself afraid to see? 
I recently turned to this thread	I've started having trouble getting through an average day	Hello r/anxiety,  <e1> I recently turned to this thread </e1>  as  <e2> I've started having trouble getting through an average day </e2> .  I've been subconsciously distracting myself from stressful tasks (doing dishes/going to class/buying groceries/homework) by spacing out watching TV or reading Facebook which is easy bc ADD runs in the family.  I have nervous habits like clicking my teeth
I	august!	I used to work where I would sit alone for 12 hours while pep slept.  It allowed me to dwell and not interact outside of my few friends.  UN I finally got the nerve to leave and find a job with people to stop sitting in my anxiety and escape it.  I now work in the food industry on the line.  I work with people I can freely talk to.  It helped me be able to talk to people I dont know outside of work too! Its really helped me and I am really happy with how Ive felt since I started in august!
I	possible.	I can socialize with anybody, I don't start fights with anyone, and I have intelligent ideas.  My only flaw is that it becomes obvious whenever I'm talking with people that I don't actually want to be talking to them.  My voice lacks confidence and my body language indicates discomfort.   If people were willing to forgive timid body language and timid conversation, then I would be able to make plenty of friends and relationships.  But most people have no patience for that.  They can't stand it.  They need to see enthusiasm for themselves or else they get mad/anxious themselves and no bond is possible.  
Does	doctor.	Does anyone have any experience being tested for this?  I've been suffering from an anxiety disorder that popped up out of the blue about thirteen years ago.   In that time I've had almost every therapy available and a plethora of drug cocktails but nothing has worked.   I've been physically getting more ill and I stumbled upon Pheo's.   I've spent a few hours watching youtube videos of patient accounts and doctor conferences and all of the symptoms really do line up with what I've been going through.  My problem is, I'm afraid I'm making it up to have something wrong with me other than this mental health thing that I can't seem to get under control.   I'm afraid my doctor will view it that way as well and deny the testing, which I understand starts with some sort of 24 hour urinalysis?   Any insight or personal experiences could help.   Even suggestions on how to broach the subject with my family doctor.

Please Help!
I thought they made a mistake	my birthday isn't for another two days	It started yesterday, when they posted a photo on instagram and tagged me in it, wishing me a happy birthday for today.   <e1> I thought they made a mistake </e1>  because  <e2> my birthday isn't for another two days </e2> , but then they posted on my Timeline (Facebook) birthday wishes even though Facebook says my birthday is in two days.  It's nice that they're wishing me a happy birthday, but how do I respond in a way telling them it's the wrong date without seeming rude or ungrateful?
I'm	post.	I'm happy that i made it the first month.   It wasn't incredibly hard this time, but getting to the point of actually quitting was.   This reddit has helped tons.   Thank you all.   I will not drink with you today.  I have noticed that time seems to flow more these days instead of being broken up into chunks between being sober and not being sober though.   It's not a bad thing just different.   I've been playing a lot of video games when i have some down time to stop me from being bored.   Someone suggested to me that I think about what I'm actually trying to avoid when I'm bored; am I really bored or do I want to drink to avoid something other than boredom.  Just saying hi and sending my first post. 
I	there.	I think this goes to show how debilitating ADHD can be.  Just how pathetically simple or ordinary something has to be for me to get excited over it.  Like, can neurotypical folks actually think about their plan for the day and put on clothes *at the same time?* That's a real /r/woahdude moment right there. 
She	in	She felt empty inside, like a black hole was consuming her, cell by cell.  When I'm silent and still I can feel that hole; it feels like my chest will cave in
Who	.	Who do you go to when all you're left with is a hundred thousand knives in the back.   who heals the cuts, the losses and the bruises.   If I'm guilty of me, who can blame me but me.   And oh, that's one hell of a cycle.   I guess I am the monster they all say I am. . .  
Eszopiclone is not registered in Russia, and I can't just ask my doctor	I was wondering if you guys could clarify it for me	It's known that Z-hypnotics can't be used on a long-term basis because of tolerance and dependence.  Recently I've encountered these two studies which claim Eszopiclone 3mg shows no evidence of tolerance or rebound insomnia after 6 and 12 months of treatment: *  ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pmc/articles/PMC1978384/ *  ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/16230048 How is that possible considering that Zopiclone, for example, [causes]( ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/pubmed/6669632?dopt=Abstract) rebound insomnia already after just three weeks?  <e1> Eszopiclone is not registered in Russia, and I can't just ask my doctor </e1> , so  <e2> I was wondering if you guys could clarify it for me </e2> .  Is Eszopiclone very different from other Z-hypnotics, or is it only because 3mg is a low dose? Is there anyone who uses it for the long term nightly, or more than two days per week?
So	drain.	So I went back to drinking Friday and haven't stopped since around 4am this morning.  I'm currently hungover.  My wife works third shift which allows me to be at home by myself at nights.  I woke up to a long Facebook messenger conversation where I was in the middle of hitting on a girl and telling her I'm unhappy in my current relationship.  Fuck me.  My anxiety disorder is going into overdrive right now.  I just messaged her back telling her thanks for being a good friend and deleted the conversation.  Why does alcohol have to be so damn addictive and yet so destructive? I'm so tired of doing the same things over and over.  I scheduled an appointment with my doctor earlier this week for the 20th.  I'm going to ask about Vivitrol because nothing is working.  I've still got some beers and some vodka left.  Thinking about pouring it all down the drain.  
It was fantastic sleep	I did not wake up anxious at 5am	I got through my first week- most notably a sober weekend.  I lied awake watching tv til 3:30am last night, not sure how to fall asleep without passing out.  I finally did go to sleep and slept for ten hours.   <e1> It was fantastic sleep </e1>  where  <e2> I did not wake up anxious at 5am </e2> .   This is definitely a holy shit moment for me.  I woke up thinking about all the different things I could do today instead of all the things I was going to have to hide from.  That is a huge realization that makes me not miss drunk weekends.  
Not even tired when it happens sometimes	I don't think it is hypnagogia	Hey guys, I'm a little worried here and just wondering if anyone experiences this.  Let me start by saying I have had some pretty severe OCD and Anxiety over the last few years.  Here's what I have been experiencin recently.  when I close my I get completely random images flashing in my mind.  Really random stuff, it could be a person, a close up of their face, an eye, a tree, a stack of books, and some really strange indescribable things.  Sometimes they only happen once every 15 seconds, other times it's just a non stop flow of random images.  I'm not sure if this is a new OCD obsession, or something a little more. . .  Psychotic.  I'm worried about schizophrenia big time.  Does anyone else experience these random mental images? It happens when I lay down to sleep, but that's not it, it also happens when I close my eyes for a few seconds, in the middle of the day.   <e1> Not even tired when it happens sometimes </e1> , so  <e2> I don't think it is hypnagogia </e2> .  Please share your thoughts.  Thanks so much for your time. 
I	more.	I work a total dead end job and while at work we joke about some really morbid shit (nothing is off the tables, death, suicide, sex, etc).  Well the other day the GM and I were joking about killing myself with a hose from the exhaust into my car as I sleep.  As far as he's concerned it's all fun and games but it's so tempting.  I don't want to live in this world anymore as a failure, in the wrong body, never being happy.  I don't *want* to die, I just *dont want* to live anymore.  I don't want to go back to cutting but I'm finding myself thinking about it more and more.  
My	dose	My med plan was probably like the most of yours; start low and go up.  After trying Ritalin I started with Vyvanse 30 mg and eventually raised it to 50 mg, at both doses I had a positive effect for a few days (4 hours effect/day).  The effect diminished and now it's REALLY hard to even notice the effect.  How did you know when you found the right dose
I	point	I was diagnosed with ADHD this past May.  I am nearly 28 and I am a female.  Before my diagnosis I began struggling with serious depression and then I developed anxiety issues as well.  I had been so depressed for so long, I began to wonder, what is wrong with me? Finally, after going in to see my doctor, for another doctors note for school, he said, have you ever been tested for ADHD? And that clicked with me.  At that point
**TL;DR	o	**TL;DR I'm looking for tips on educating people that don't really 'get' ADHD.  or that someone can just sympathize with me and give me motivation to keep educating people. **   I've been fairly open with friends &amp; family regarding my ADHD.  I talk to them about the struggles of finding the right meds, when I have off-days, when I have super hero days, etc.  However, this has turned into: * o
I	sleep.	I took an adderal 20mg extended release for the first time at 4:30 pm.  Regretful.  Although I tore through my studies and got a lot done, it robbed me of any potential sleep.  After finishing my school work at 2:30 am I spent the remainder of the night staring at the cieling with my mind and body racing.  My guess is that since my tolerance is close to nothing my body couldn't break down the amphetine and it lasted much longer than eight hours.  I'm not sure what I expected.  My advice is to not take an extended release past 3pm if you wish to have any kind of sleep. 
Once I bought a chocolate milk, and she got a chocolate milk too.   She droned on and on about how similar we are	now I'm freaking scared to like chocolate milk	I'm petrified I'll become like my mother.    <e1> Once I bought a chocolate milk, and she got a chocolate milk too.   She droned on and on about how similar we are </e1> ,  <e2> now I'm freaking scared to like chocolate milk </e2> .   Any gut reaction I have to a situation I think, is this how I'm supposed to react? or is this how she would have reacted? I can barely accept we write our lowercase G's similarly.   The other day
My	experience.	My SO is undiagnosed.  He has refused seeking treatment for years but is supposedly planning to finally do so this month.  He has been fluctuating between mixed, manic, and hypomanic for the past several months, which is the longest I've seen in our many years together, all while declaring he doesn't feel bipolar anymore.  His behaviour has become increasingly unacceptable, and I don't know whether to wait it out assuming upcoming treatment or to confront him on it and demand more respect.  Confrontation while manic has not gone well in the past.   New account to post here but have been reading for a while.  Thanks for any advice or shared experience.  
I	hahahaha	I made a joke during my presentation and not a single person changed his or her facial expression. .  except. .  . . for my crush!! she laughed and flipped her hair!! Well being embarrassed in front of 97 people was worth it right hahahaha
my husband got really quiet	He is aware of my history and the book in question	My husband and I were talking about books that we would like to read aloud to our child soon.  One of the first ones that popped into my head was Matilda ( it is by R.  Dahl, writer of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, for the unaware).  It is one of my favorites since the 4th grade! . . .  <e1> my husband got really quiet </e1> .   <e2> He is aware of my history and the book in question </e2> .  I never really looked back on it until he mentioned it. . .  but fuck poor sweet Matilda.  Even as a 4th grader I realised deep down I related more to a fictional character than my own N family. 
I feel bad for leaving early	I missed the day before	Got really clamy and dizzy at work and have felt that way all day.   <e1> I feel bad for leaving early </e1>  because  <e2> I missed the day before </e2> ,but I work around heat lamps and hot wells which only made things worse.  And my boyfriend is disappointed in me to. . what else can go wrong. . 
Looking	attacks	Looking for anything you guys use to calm down when you're having panic/ anxiety attacks
So,	yeah	So, I moved states about a year and a half ago, and about two weeks ago I finally managed to make it to the DMV to change my car's registration to my new state and to get a driver's license in my new state.  I was so happy that I finally got it done and so proud, only now I keep forgetting to put my new license plates on &gt;. &lt; I think about it every day and then I say oh yeah
as I'm transitioning into adulthood	I want to better myself	Note: I am not self-diagnosing.  I'm meeting with my doctor on Monday to discuss possible ADHD.  I'm 17 years old and I've always been too afraid to talk to anybody about the problems I've had in my life, but  <e1> as I'm transitioning into adulthood </e1>   <e2> I want to better myself </e2> .  I have always felt very alone and knowing people who feel as I do are out there makes me feel really happy and more okay with myself.  I'm hoping she can refer my to a psychiatrist who can evaluate me further. Again, I'm not self-diagnosing but I believe it's highly possible, hence why I'm going to discuss it.  I'll probably post again on Monday after my visit. 
It's warming up in the northern hemisphere	the fact that you've been counting on it being cold as hell in your car and thus the time when nothing will smell or get weird from the leftover wrappers and empty coffees and smoothie bottles is about to end, go throw that shit out before it gets warm enough to get super gross	 <e1> It's warming up in the northern hemisphere </e1> , so  <e2> the fact that you've been counting on it being cold as hell in your car and thus the time when nothing will smell or get weird from the leftover wrappers and empty coffees and smoothie bottles is about to end, go throw that shit out before it gets warm enough to get super gross </e2> !
I've tried to fight it	I just end up staying up all night	Every night, I *need* to fall asleep watching Legally Blonde or something really bad will happen to me, or so my brain tells me.   <e1> I've tried to fight it </e1>  and  <e2> I just end up staying up all night </e2> . It's not really not hindering my life that much just to put it on before falling asleep, so i'm not too worried about it right now. But when I step back and think about it, I just laugh at how silly it sounds haha.  It's a great movie, I have no problem with watching it as I fall asleep.  I just think it's kinda funny what OCD can do to you. 
The	trapped.	The one thing that haunts me probably the most in my shitty existence is that I don't do the things I want to do.  Aside of doing my music, I would like to record some kind of vlogs, but my life is not that interesting.  I want to record some videos talking about certain topics, but I'm too afraid of judgement. I would love to participate in a running competition.  Or go into a boxing ring with someone more experienced to see what are my weaknesess are.  I would like to try a strongman training, even when I'm not that huge or strong.  I would absolutely LOVE to do more exciting things, than just sitting in my room depressed, anxious about finding a job and lacking money, sharing house with abusive family, but I'm too crippled by my thoughts and current situation.  I want to do so many things, but I'm getting in my own way.  It makes me even more depressed and anxious.  I feel like a coward, lacking courage to do whatever I want.  I feel like I'm trapped.  
not being normal	it to work	I saw my battalion's psychological officer this week, and he just told me all the stuff that I've heard before: stop drinking alcohol, exercise more, sleep less, find a hobby, and make more plans.  If these things worked for me, my depression would have been gone years ago.  Now this advice just makes me feel guilty for  <e1> not being normal </e1>  enough for  <e2> it to work </e2> . 
now every time I see someone actually reaching out for help and understanding, I feel sick inside	it feels like I'm sat in the same place reading the same stuff over and over again and I'm just kind of completely dis-connected from it	Not literally every post, but every title.  And  <e1> now every time I see someone actually reaching out for help and understanding, I feel sick inside </e1> , because  <e2> it feels like I'm sat in the same place reading the same stuff over and over again and I'm just kind of completely dis-connected from it </e2> .  From everything really.  This isn't a rant.  I'm not seeking change from this community.  The people on this subreddit are freaking amazing in how supportive they are, and the subreddit itself is unique in how people can open up to others that can relate to them. I just wanted to tell someone, visiting this page use to help so much and now I don't even have that.  I was going to message a friend on facebook about it, but stopped myself from being a total dumbass in time.  
I woke up	realized life isn't so bad	I have been going through a hard time these past few weeks but today  <e1> I woke up </e1>  and  <e2> realized life isn't so bad </e2> .  I don't know how long this feeling will last but I'm happy right now and I want to share this with all of you :)
I	sometimes.	I just had and implemented what could be a good idea for finding things when I've forgotten where I've put them or figure out where to put them once I've used them.     I created the simplest excel file with one column for things and one for where they are :P it seems pretty stupid, but it could solve some of those WHERE THE FUCK IS IT moments.    If you do this, don't try to write down where everything is right now, just add things to the file as you put them away/spend a day looking for them.  Keep it simple.  Also, note down the first place you look for something and make that the place where you keep it, if possible. I think this may help me a lot! Provided I remember that the file exists and where I saved it, that is. TL;DR: create an excel file with one column for things, and one for where to find them.  Use it when you can't find things or when you change their place.  It won't always work, but it will sometimes. 
I just realized about five minutes ago that I haven't taken a single pain med today - I haven't been hurting	I even realized it was I was starting to feel withdrawal symptoms	In hopefully easy to read format:* I'm on day two of my first ADHD prescription, I'm taking 15mg of Adderall twice a day.  * I'm also a chronic pain sufferer (MS-like issues, partially paralyzed digestive/waste system) and have been on a steady dosage of opiates for years.   I am under the care of a good pain management doc who periodically weans me off of the pain meds so we can see where things stand, but I have always needed to go back on them; they are the only thing that gets me through the day.   <e1> I just realized about five minutes ago that I haven't taken a single pain med today - I haven't been hurting </e1> .   The only reason  <e2> I even realized it was I was starting to feel withdrawal symptoms </e2> . This is fantastic news for me! I am now wondering if I can get off the opiates entirely.   Does anyone have any experience with Adderall, opiates and chronic pain?
Feeling	drinking.	Feeling really depressed tonight.  Have an appointment with a new therapist in the morning and I'm hoping it goes well.  Regardless, still not drinking. 
I	drink	I went home for the holidays and ended up having a drink and then I couldn't stop.  I'm not sure what triggered it still.  I was hesitant to drink.  I feel maybe it was the fear of doing it again while in an out of control state of mind.  When I decided to drink
I've	explanation/solution?	I've been on Concerta for 5 years.  My dosage has gone up and down but I settled on 54mg about 9 months ago. I've had a look at other threads about this but I struggled to find anyone whose experience really matches mine. Concerta works well for me but about 2-3 hours after I take it, I get really zonked and spaced-out.  It lasts about an hour or two.  I can't get anything done till this time passes. I'm struggling to use what I know about how concerta works (the timing of drug release) to figure out what's going on/what a solution might be.  Is there too little of the drug at that time and I'd maybe benefit from a supplementary IR tablet? Or is there too much and I should explore a different medication that might work better (maybe 36mg twice a day? It's so hard to remember to take a second dose though!)Thank you for reading. TLDR: Concerta makes me sleepy two hours after taking, what's a possible explanation/solution?
I am strangely calm	I don't even know how to react	Today is one of those days when I feel life crushing me.   <e1> I am strangely calm </e1>  as  <e2> I don't even know how to react </e2> .  My body is reacting though - my skin has broken out in hives all over.  I feel lonely, helpless, and in despair.  I feel confirmed that my life is not worth living.  Yet due to family obligations I need to trudge on.  People always say how suicide affects family, how they suffer, and how selfish it is to die and leave these problems to them.  Yet isn't it also selfish that I am obliged to live, through hell and high waters, simply so no one's feelings are hurt? I hurt every day.  Since I was a child.  Having waited this long, always hoping that hope is just around the corner, I'm just too bloody tired.  
I	'em!	I think this is the farthest I've ever come.  Only took like what, 4 tries? haha.  You can do it!!! Free yourself from the shackles of nicotine!I do still crave occasionally but not nearly as much as I used to or thought I would.  Life's a simpler time when it's not revolving around smoking.  Don't need to plan my budget to fit in my packs every week, don't need to take that 5-10 minute break every half hour that I'm doing work, don't need to be wary of the nasty smell of filters on my fingers. It's pretty great.  Get 'em!
It also makes me feel so sad	he was in so much pain that he killed himself	For many reasons this is hitting me pretty hard.  I was a teenager when he died and his music spoke to me and opened me to all the rage and bitterness I was feeling inside.  It is also making me feel really old and it's hard to think how his death was so long ago now and so far away in my own personal history.   <e1> It also makes me feel so sad </e1>  that  <e2> he was in so much pain that he killed himself </e2> , partly because now I have depression as well I unfortunately understand how bleak and dark it can get.  Sorry this is a bit of jumbled mess.  Then I feel bad about myself and if I died I wouldn't be leaving anything of note, no music or books or art.  Nothing that matters anyway, I will be forgotten like most of us but some like KC will always be remembered.  Just thinking about all this is heartbreaking.  At this point I'm just crying and I don't even know what about anymore.  Life is so tragic and hard and the death of someone who I never met that happened over 20 years ago has brought me undone. 
I'm going to make this really quick	I have to run	TL;DR - ADD is life on hard mode.  Drugs are great.  All of you are awesome, and don't forget it.  edit: Of course the damn title isn't spelled right. --- <e1> I'm going to make this really quick </e1>  because  <e2> I have to run </e2> , but want to share a realization I had.  Background   - I'm a 36you guy, graduate degree, well paying job, etc.  But still felt like I just couldn't do shit.  Like if I let my guard down too much I would just end up sitting on the couch and everything I have would vanish.   - Got diagnosed with ADD-I around Nov 2016 and started on Rubifen.  Got to 10mg 2xday and didn't feel too different.  I couldn't see through time as I told my friends.  Tried upping dose a bit but got anxiety
I was kind sad	I had been working really hard to listen to others more and ask questions and help them	The other day me and my group of friends (5 people) Were going to say something good about eachother.  It was easy for them to say something nice about eachother but when it came to me they all had a hard time finding something 2 of them didn't say anything about me just said something like Uhhhhh let me think.  One of them told me I did funny stuff sometimes but in the wrong time and place.   <e1> I was kind sad </e1>  as  <e2> I had been working really hard to listen to others more and ask questions and help them </e2> .  But still they kind of forgot about me.  I don't know what to do anymore
I	advice?	I have very minimal desire to smoke weed at this point.  I mean I wasn't that heavy of a user in the first place.  But the part of my mind that craves some form of inebriation in the evening is still very much alive and well.  I've been drinking a 6-pack to myself *at least* twice a week.  It's a slippery slope I've started down, and I'm afraid that it could turn into alcoholism if I don't get a handle on it quickly.  Any advice?
We wont remember anything after we die in my own beliefs there isnt anything after	why even live to begin with none of this will matter eventually everything will cease to exist	Im not even really sad i just dont feel the need to wanna live anymore i get sad sometimes but it passes.   <e1> We wont remember anything after we die in my own beliefs there isnt anything after </e1> .  So  <e2> why even live to begin with none of this will matter eventually everything will cease to exist </e2> .  Im seriously going to do it soon.  At 15 years old.  Thanks for reading dont bother replying this is just so someone knows how i feel.  
your friend who was depressed	she got you all depressed!	I'm at school right now as I write this and I can confidently say my life will not get better.  My parents hate each other and even though they love me, their constant yelling and my dads alcoholism has made my home life a living hell.  My mom isn't supportive of my depression at all and doesn't listen without interrupting me and going like well it's probably because of  <e1> your friend who was depressed </e1>  and  <e2> she got you all depressed! </e2>  Shut the fuck up you fucking retard.  I genuinely can't wait until the day they die or are old and suffering from dementia or some shit and I get to put them in some old folks home and never have to visit them.  The only person in my family I would miss is my sister.  Were pretty good friends and we often stay up late at night cooking food.  I've never had a job before and even though I'm training to be a lifeguard
I think I'm missing something, and feel like I should be doing something to keep my prescription safe	I'm travelling for work in a month or so	I'm probably just being paranoid, but I just started taking Adderall XR, and have heard a bunch of horror stories about people's meds getting stolen.  I've never had prescription medication besides like antibiotics and stuff, so this is all new for me.  I honestly wasn't too worried about it until I saw stuff like this: amazon. com/dp/B00JV5FOQK/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=2D3NCL6L7GEIC&amp;coliid=I34OGYSSXUQQL amazon. com/GateKeeper-Innovations-Safer-Locking-Bottle/dp/B00F8YPU7Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1487796623&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=locking+pill+bottle. . . and now  <e1> I think I'm missing something, and feel like I should be doing something to keep my prescription safe </e1> , as  <e2> I'm travelling for work in a month or so </e2> .  I know I'm probably just being paranoid, and I'm honestly a lot more likely to lose my medication than have it stolen. Even so, I was curious.  How do you all travel with your meds? 
I've	common?	I've been trying not to self-harm, and focus on my extra anxiety and stress on something else.  All I want to do is hit and fight someone.  I have never felt this way before.  I want to scream and kick someone, grab their hair and smash them against a wall.  I feel angry for no reason.  Is this common?
when she gets in her crisis modes and rails on me	things that were very tiny	I have a relationship with my girlfriend currently that has lasted 4 years.   I first thought occasionally was that she was dealing with some paranoid thoughts, social anxiety, and/or delusions during stress. . .  After seeing the signs grow increasingly worse and worse recently to the point where she has said some hurtful things when she gets stressed (multiple times in the last few months), I am pretty sure I am dealing with BPD. . .  Most of the sites I see tell me to basically run for the hills.   I was curious if this was actually what I should do. It is just increasingly stressful  <e1> when she gets in her crisis modes and rails on me </e1>  so  <e2> things that were very tiny </e2> 
Anybody	down?	Anybody know how to get Melatonin in the UK to help with sleep? I went to my GP who told me it was 2nd protocol drug which means only hospital can prescribe it and was pretty surprised.  Anybody know the low down?
I cannot say I am happy with my choice	I am well aware of its cons	I have just spent more than one hour choosing between possible travel arrangements. Each option had its pros and cons and I think I am unable to compare them.   <e1> I cannot say I am happy with my choice </e1>  because  <e2> I am well aware of its cons </e2> .  More importantly, I am quite tired and lost most of the momentum I had before. Have you found ways of dealing with choice that make the process easier and less tiring?
I work in the EMS field	it is a high stress job but I have worked many cases of critical care calls and I do fine	I've been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for over a year now.  At first it was every day multiple panic attacks with major depression.  After changing my diet, quitting smoking, and going on runs regularly I managed to end my panic attacks all together.   <e1> I work in the EMS field </e1> , so  <e2> it is a high stress job but I have worked many cases of critical care calls and I do fine </e2> , earlier this week was different though.  Dispatched out to the call, got the patient, he is deteriorating fast.  In the middle of transporting him my body goes numb and I become self aware.  I immediately recognize it as a panic attack, I power through and continue what I am doing focusing on my pt.  Not sure if anyone here has ever had that happen.   
It turned out I had a panic disorder, which just kept getting more and more severe over time and eventually I was scared to go out	I saw a doctor	This is an update to a post I made asking for help late last year when I first began struggling with mental illnessI am just so happy and relieved to have taken the advice and see my doctor.   <e1> It turned out I had a panic disorder, which just kept getting more and more severe over time and eventually I was scared to go out </e1>  and so  <e2> I saw a doctor </e2> . I am currently taking medication for this issue, in fact I have been for 3 months now and I finally understand it when people say it is A LIFE SAVER.  My mood and panic attacks have drastically improved, of course don't go away but I can finally function again.  I am so relieved. 
Today I felt the anxiety come back	a short one on one meeting with my manager	I get extreme anxiety around meetings, especially presentations and 1 on 1 meetings.  I think the anxiety comes out the most when I have to imagine myself explaining something.  I think the thought of being nervous terrifies me, and when i feel a twinge of nervousness, all hell breaks loose.   <e1> Today I felt the anxiety come back </e1>  during  <e2> a short one on one meeting with my manager </e2> .  I completely stopped listening to my manager and just focused on the anxiety and allowed it to exist within myself.  I told myself, his is your anxiety
I've	happy.	I've been slowly drifting from suicidal ideation to very real, very intense feelings of committing suicide.  Finally ending this life.  I'm so fucking lonely is the crux of it.  I was damned with severe anxiety, awkwardness, depression, etc.  and I'm either not strong enough, or not able to improve myself/my position.  I'm getting to the point where I can't live any longer by myself.  I feel like I'm losing my sanity because of it.  I want someone that I love and understand, and someone that's loves and understands me in return.  Why is it so difficult? Why am I so self-defeating? I am the biggest obstacle in my progression to happiness.  I just want to be happy. 
I've	happens.	I've given up on trying to have a halfway decent life.  I never have and never will, and even if a life like that were meant for me, I am never going to have the strength to fight for it.  I'm never going to trust professionals again, I'm never going to have people in my life.  I keep deluding myself into thinking there's a chance for me to get away from here and start over but I know that's not happening.  I can't have strength here, I can't afford a place to stay unless I work and fight, and I can't do those things without strength.  At this point, I just wish I weren't so afraid of everything, that I would just work up the nerve to end it.  I just want the pain to stop and I really don't care how that happens.  
Once	help.	Once I come down from flashbacks or panic attacks, I get really bad disassociation.  Sometimes lasting for days.  Does anyone else go through this.  Any tips on how to stop it.  I tried grounding but Im so far gone it doesn't help. 
But that someone doesn't want to be in my life anymore	i have become that emo suicidal teenager again	I am an emotional mess right now.  Heart broken to the point of being suicidal.  I don't want to die, have to take care of the people in my life.  Right now i am hurting so much that i want to cut myself.  I don't want to be a reckless person.  I used to cut myself 8 years ago, but found someone, who was so especial that i stopped.   <e1> But that someone doesn't want to be in my life anymore </e1> , and  <e2> i have become that emo suicidal teenager again </e2> .  How to people stop themselves from cutting.    I was sitting with a razor blade but threw it away.  I have a deep desire to cut my wright right now.  Haven't felt this urge in ages.  Please tell me how can i stop having these urges.  I am a mess.  
I	that.	I can't help you if you don't let meI don't want to be helped i want to die I don't want my depression to go away I just want to dieBut if I die my friends and family will be really sad and I don't want that. 
I'm a pro-procasinator** look I'm not too good with English	I don't think that's the correct word I'm looking for	Hello, guys how's it going?rrI'm just here to rant about my life.  If u don't like people ranting fell free to click awayrrBut first here is a list about stuff I hate in. my life :rr* r**homework ** I think you guys can also relate to this subject, my maths teacher gives us soo much HW that it takes about 4-5 hours to finish it for an average student. and I'm not a bright kid either .   <e1> I'm a pro-procasinator** look I'm not too good with English </e1>  so  <e2> I don't think that's the correct word I'm looking for </e2> . all I'm trying to say is I think about working and I say to myself it could wait 5 minutes   and after 5 minutes I think maybe in 10 minutes.  This will continue till the end of the day. rrrr**I can't control myself ** this is one of the biggest probs in my life.  I go to take a bath thinking I won't masturbate today but eventually I will masturbate. this also happens with sweets. rrrr**I only think about myself** just like it says.  I help others
I've been having a really tough time giving up the devil's lettuce	it might help to reach out to some of you successful leavers for some advice	  <e1> I've been having a really tough time giving up the devil's lettuce </e1>  and thought  <e2> it might help to reach out to some of you successful leavers for some advice </e2> .  I'll be turning 40 this year and have been a pretty hardcore stoner since I was 14.  Whenever I try to quit, I get really depressed and it seems like the only thing that gets me happy again and feeling normal is to get stoned.  Last year I stopped smoking for almost 2 months and throughout that whole time it I felt unable to feel joy or really very much emotion at all.  I felt very joyless and humorless, and the world felt colorless and kinda cruel.  To be honest, it kinda freaked me out.  Is it possible that I've been smoking so heavily and for so long that now I can't experience happiness without being baked? It appears to be that way and it's really bumming me out.  
I'm	someone.	I'm feeling paranoid.  I don't understand anything, and the nightmare seems to be getting unbearable.  I'm afraid and I don't know what to think or what to do. Really need to talk with someone.  
I'm	reading.	I'm on day 1 of my detox today.   I'm doing it at home with medication from an addiction doctor.   Of course, this isn't my first rodeo.   I've detoxed at least 5 times before -- sometimes at the hospital, sometimes at home.   Physically, I'm feeling okay due to the meds, but I'm going into the hyper-emotional and depressed state that always happens when I detox.   I'm really bored, but at least I'm feeling okay physically and I can watch TV.   At the hospital there is NOTHING to do -- no TV, no computer.   Just wanted to share.   Thanks for reading. 
Out	again!	Out to dinner for my mom's 62nd birthday this evening.  Fully present in my own life, showing up for my family, with my children - all 3 of us clean, happy and healthy.  My Dad:  When are you going to cut back to, like, one AA meeting a month? Me:  Probably right before I start drinking again! 
How	easy?	How have you accepted all the frustrations and limitations ADHD/ADD has brought upon your life? How are you trying to get toward acceptance to the possibility that you may never be fulfilled as a person? Or did you just have to change your mind on what being fulfilled meant for you instead? I am still trying to balance the need for acceptance and compassion toward myself while also feeling that I know I can do better and can change my life in amazing ways.  Many of us know we are smart, creative, and unique individuals but its like our mind's are blocking us from our full potential.  How do you cope with so many shortcomings and failures with tasks that can be so simple and easy? 
I	zelda	I hate this painI hate waking up every hour or two in a cold sweatEvery waking moment alive are just hellI should be in the hospitalI hate everythingMy mind is brokenIt hurts when I pissIt hurts when I swallowIt hurts when I thinkI just wanna sleep. But I'm waiting for zelda
I	.	I just don't want to live right now. . .  I'm sitting the the bath thing how much I want to drop my phone into the bath or just cut up all the way down my arm and just bleed out. . .  But I never do it cause of one person. . .  But I don't want to feel this pain Anymore. . .  
Hello	ADHD?	Hello I am worried about the long term safety of methylphenidate after reading the following article:  plos. org/plosone/article?id=10. 1371/journal. pone. 0063023 it claims that stimulants can have a negative affect on Dopamine Active Transporters that can make ADHD symptoms worse when off the medication, and decrease the medication over time.  Could this make stimulant medications a bad idea if I only have mild/moderate ADHD?
I'm	this.	I'm 17 almost 18 and I've been cutting for maybe almost a year now and I don't know what to do.  I'm in a relationship with someone who completely understands what I'm going through but she lives in a different state and can't do much to help.  I'm too scared to tell my parents or my doctor I'm scared of what will happen if I do.  I know I need to tell my parents but I can't bring my self to do it.  I just can't stop cutting lately It's starting to get worse again, I've been moving back to cutting vertically down my wrists and drawing a decent amount of blood.  People at school are starting to notice and make fun of me for the cuts on my wrists and it's just really making me feel more and more like I should end it.  I just don't know what to do with my self do I end it? Or do I just keep going on and try my best to hide my cuts and scars from people.  Sorry for the scatterbrain post it's kinda late at the time I'm writing this. 
I	this.	I can't keep living with bipolar and always having to deal with being depressed and fucking crazy.  I'm so mean to people I love and then I expect them to still love me.  And then I go crazy at them and desperately scream for them to come back. I'm hurting to much.  I feel so fucking alone in all of this. 
Past the point of redemption for reasons	I really can't control	So lately I've been dreaming of my stresses.  My plan is to buy a gun and kmsl when I turn 21, but last night I dreamed I had a shotgun.  I picked up the gun and pointed it at my head and was suddenly hesitant.  I knew one finger flick would open a world of the unknown.  Then I woke up IRL.  I don't understand this.  A part of me is suspicious that I don't want to commit suicide, but my life is really hell.  I really hate this world and I really do see everything going downhill.   <e1> Past the point of redemption for reasons </e1>   <e2> I really can't control </e2> .  Suicide is the best option; I just feel selfish for wanting to fight so much.  I feel stupid.  My fear angers me. 
My	healthy	My badge says its tomorrow, but I know I had my last drink 30 days ago.  I was on here on day 2 (or was it 3) saying how proud I was I strung together more than 48 hours for the first time since high school.  In the last couple weeks I have not been reading this sub nearly as often as I did the first couple weeks.  The first couple weeks sucked.  I mean they SUCKED.  This helped beyond words.  I would avoid the kitchen during cravings and go to my room and read this.  It saved me.  So, 30 days- here is what has happened.  1) on day 4, a drinking buddy called and I told him i was taking time off.  His response if you're trying to get healthy
As	folks.	As I approach 2 months without alcohol, I was feeling inspired by some of the before and after pics that sometimes pop up on this sub.  I was curious to take a look back on what I physically looked like when I was drinking heavily, and took to facebook to see if I could find any pictures where I would notice a difference.  Instead I noticed something else.  9/10 photos of me that I am tagged in from the last four or five years feature alcohol.  Constant party group photos, club photos, drinking with colleagues, coworkers, family.  Alcohol made it's way into them all.  Sometimes it was even a hidden beer bottle in the background of the photo.  Sometimes it was me in a state of belligerence funneling god knows what, and sometimes it was me passed out on the floor.  I deleted almost all of them.  Didn't save them anywhere.  They are gone.  Heres to not drinking today with you fine folks. 
I	input.	I work 2 days out of the week at 6 am, and 2 other days at 7 am, I have school at 8 am one day and 11 am one other day.  I'm only off on Saturday.  Do you guys have any experience with splitting your pills, or varying the time of day you take it on some days? I have class until 6:20 pm both days I have class, so I want to maximize the duration it is effective.  I also want to try to use the medication to help me wake up and get to work on time.  So I'm afraid if I consistently take my medication at say 5 am for the benefits of waking up for work, I'm afraid the days I don't work and go to school it will wear off far too soon.  Thanks for any input. 
it just wont stick to my mind as I try to read	I am anxious in a constant state	So, I used to be very good at learning, well I still am, but when it comes to academical studies, with books and stuff,  <e1> it just wont stick to my mind as I try to read </e1>  cause  <e2> I am anxious in a constant state </e2> . . . So, could you guys help me out, and tell me if there is a connection between anxitey and a difficulty learning?
My	:)	My roommate just shattered his maybe two-week old rig that costed him over $ 200.  Now he's out $ 200 and doesn't have anything to dab with.  So glad I quit I'm not fiending for weed like I used to and wasting my money :)
Apparently	hours.	Apparently chest pains is a side effect of temazepam and I have the worst anxiety because of it.  I am convinced it could be a heart attack and I'm going to die.  I can't calm down enough to sleep and it'll be in my system for 6 and a half more hours. 
I	reading	I know its only been 4 days but I feel weird.  I feel more lethargic than usual.  My appetite isn't as big as it once was.  I've been in smoking situations and gladly declined but my body feels weird.  Thanks for reading
I was taking it at very small doses	I would forget to take my second dose at night	Recently I was taken off of Buspar i think a week or two ago,  <e1> I was taking it at very small doses </e1>  because  <e2> I would forget to take my second dose at night </e2> , I was taking it for about 6 months and now i can't seem to keep my legs still, I think it's both being off the Buspar and I've been going on 15 minute walks for the past few weeks.  I'm also on Gabapentin and Celexa and can take Klonopin as needed. I'm confused about why trying to treat my anxiety is making it worse, I was stable when taking the Buspar for a while then just the perfect storm happened 5 weeks ago where life threw so many things at me and I can't seem to recover and it's so frustrating. 
Every	situation?	Every time I am hungry and I make something I end up not even being able to eat it.  I'm on day 4 and just woke up, starving.  Any suggestions on food that is easy to put down when dealing with this kind of situation?

Hello,I	back?	Hello,I was a daily smoker for about a year when I was 17 years old.  Before that I smoked occasionally, but the bi or thri-weekly habit grew into a daily habit and then I quit and now I smoke on occasion again.  I would like to quit completely soon. I feel like my motivation has drained since my daily habit.  Will my dopamine levels and motivation ever come back?
it's like my brain is now free to worry about going to sleep	anxiety and therefore wakes itself up, yet I can't stop it	It's infuriating, as soon as I put it down  <e1> it's like my brain is now free to worry about going to sleep </e1>  which causes  <e2> anxiety and therefore wakes itself up, yet I can't stop it </e2> . 
hey	Thanks!	hey guys,I started smoking late last year, after going through divorce.  I had a break, but during an especially tough phase I smoked 1 pack/day for a short time.  I decided to quit now, cold turkey.  I feel sharp chest pain, I'm incredibly exhausted, irritated 24/7, have headaches and stomachaches after every meal.  Is this normal when you quit smoking? And if so, how long before I feel normal again?The time period I smoked for was short, but it seems like it was enough for me to get hooked quite a bit. Thanks!
Saw a post that inspired me to try to quit again.  Honestly, I enjoy smoking, but i know how It is effecting me negatively	So I want to make choices to better my life	 <e1> Saw a post that inspired me to try to quit again.  Honestly, I enjoy smoking, but i know how It is effecting me negatively </e1> .   <e2> So I want to make choices to better my life </e2> .  Here are some of those choices. 1)quit soda2)quit smoking3)quit fapping4)quit staying up till I crash from exhaustion. What I replaced it with1) water2)Honey sticks3)Guitar/cold showers4)sleep earlier and feel rested when I get up.  (Roomate helps with accountability)
Games aren't making me happy	there's not really anything to keep me busy	Even when something good does happen I don't feel any happier.  Music is getting more and more boring.  Everything just feels empty.   <e1> Games aren't making me happy </e1>  so  <e2> there's not really anything to keep me busy </e2> .  I think my friends feel kinda similar yet they keep going somehow
I'm	trying?	I'm heavily contemplating giving up, but truthfully I'm worried my social life will cut in half, I'll get board or become boring.   Or is this just something I tell myself to stop me from trying?
Get	Cry.	Get invited to a friends housewarming.  Forget to charge phone beforehand.  Arrive almost 50 minutes late.  Get told by his roommate everyone has left already for the pub just down the road.  Forget whether the roommate said to turn left or right at the end of the street.  Go the wrong way.  Acquire correct directions from a convenience store worker.  Forget what the pub was called.  Look in every pub up and down the road multiple times.  Give up.  Return home.  Find out they had returned to the flat just as you were leaving to find the pub anyway and if you had a charged phone you would've received a text telling you exactly that. Cry. 
The	fail.	The stories here seem to be predominantly unsuccessful ones.  They are not particularly uplifting and seems to send the message that we are somewhat doomed to fail. 
I never have been in a relationship	ADHD and that makes sense	I have, like many of you, dealt with severe diagnosed ADHD my entire life.  I understand and fully accept that symptoms manifest in lots of different ways and to varying degrees in all of us.  That being said I am slightly concerned and honestly taken aback by the amount of posts I've seen recently which refer to the way the disorder affects personal relationships with a darkly hopeless and assumptive tone.  E. G. ,  <e1> I never have been in a relationship </e1>  because of  <e2> ADHD and that makes sense </e2> .  There is kind of an inductive reasoning being masked as deductive.  I'm not trying to argue that ADHD doesn't effect relationships.  It absolutely does.  I'm also not trying to argue that in some manifestations it can't prevent an otherwise normal person from experiencing healthy relationships in a way that they would prefer.  My concern is that we as a group are supporting
Because of other side effects	i decided to stop using though	Just posting this to see if anyone else has had this effect. Before using meds i have always slept poorly.  Falling asleep way too late.  Sleeping forever but never feeling like i got any rest and being unable to leave the bed after waking up. After starting on ritalin I would have this amazing effect at the end of the day when the last dose wears off.  I would feel as if my brain was just shutting down  and i would fall asleep no matter what. In the morning my alarm would go, I'd take the 1st dose and sleep a few more minutes and jump straight out of bed when it kicked in. It was the best thing that ever happened to me and nearly cured all depression.   <e1> Because of other side effects </e1>   <e2> i decided to stop using though </e2> .  At least for a while. To my great surprise almost a year later now i still fall asleep at normal times, get good rest and am able to wake up on time( whenever I'm not depressed)Just wondering if anyone else experienced something similar or if there is a good explanation.

I was prescribed 20mg Adderall IR once a day, but I asked to try XR	it didn't get me through the work day	 <e1> I was prescribed 20mg Adderall IR once a day, but I asked to try XR </e1>  since  <e2> it didn't get me through the work day </e2> .  My doctor was happy to accommodate, but he wrote me a prescription for 20mg Adderall XR.  My understanding is that this would mean I'm basically getting two 10mg IR doses in one pill? Or am I misunderstanding? I would've thought that I would need to double the total dose. Also, why is the XR so much more expensive, even in generic form? I'm paying almost 4x more!
I	.	I can't get into all the details, but there are some vague meetings at work that are making me nervous, anxious, and angry about my job--a temp-to-perm position that was supposed to convert to permanent back in November.   I don't love it here and have been looking for other jobs for a while, but I've been slowly piecing my life back together.   I feel like losing my job would mean going back to square one and losing the peace I've been trying to create.   I haven't been this anxious in a long time and my normal coping mechanisms aren't calming me down. . .  
So	prescription	So long story short: Vyvanse has helped me overcome a lot of obstacles that not only my depression causes, but along with my ADHD.  On days that I don't take Vyvanse, things can get bad.  I binge eat really easily, I feel catatonic and just miserable.  My vyvanse has helped me feel a bit more normal.  It doesn't give me super-highs or anything (which I'm glad for) but it helps keep me focused and like makes me feel a bit more normal if that makes sense. I don't have a xanax prescription
I	something	I got pulled over the other day, the first time and of course the one time I get distracted and go a little too fast.  I was calm and respectful but freaked out when I couldn't find my insurance, he assured me it was fine and said he could check it with my tag.  He took my license back to his car and I got time for my anxiety to realize what the heck was going on.  all of a sudden I felt stupid and mentally attacking myself and freaking out.  By the time the cop came back to my door (luckily without his ticket book) I was sobbing.  He was like, are you okay? He didn't even tell me to slow down I think me crying freaked him out or something
Not	distracted	Not only are you always distracted
I've	been	I've been suffering from anxiety and ptsd since I was 13, actively working towards recovery for the past three years.  It's been up and down, of course, but overall I've made really encouraging progress. For the past six months I've been dating a really sweet guy, someone I think is worthy of my trust and good for me.  We're both interested in being together long-term.  This is the first healthy relationship I've ever been in, and I've been working really hard not to let past experiences and my own issues negatively affect our partnership.  Although he knows about my anxiety and ptsd, and he's offered support and understanding whenever I open up about it, I realize I'm trying to hide and inconvenient symptoms or feelings from him. He often doesn't have time to see me when I need him, or has to cancel dates because of his work schedule.  This hasn't been an issue in the past.  Lately I need more support, but I really struggle to ask him about it. I want our relationship to be balanced, and I don't want to put him in a caregiver role by asking for help.  I'm scared to damage what's been
I've had an allergy test before that basically said I was more allergic to water than anything else	So when I don't know what's wrong	It's 2:45 in the morning and I had a big cry/possible anxiety attack a little while ago.  When I started to calm down, my upper lip felt doubled in size.  This has never happened to me before, and  <e1> I've had an allergy test before that basically said I was more allergic to water than anything else </e1> .    <e2> So when I don't know what's wrong </e2> , I start to freak out more.  I'm about to go to sleep and my lip is still swollen after 15 minutes.  Hopefully this is just anxiety making it worse for me, but I'm pretty scared to go to sleep.  I'm going to try though.  If I die I guess this is my last post? Thanx anxiety for making me think I'm gonna die :-)UPDATE: am not dead.  thanx anxiety:-)
I've	hallucinations?	I've been reading online that nitrous oxide is good for helping with withdrawal symptoms.  I've tried a lot of things, from staying at mom's and taking Xanax to checking myself into full on detox for 3 days, I've been in group therapy, I see a psychologist and a nutritionist both regularly, I really hate aa, and live in co where whippets are on the tame side of our head shops.  Never done it though, except at the dentist like a decade ago.  so can anyone describe exactly how it helps? Can I just sit on my couch and smoke pot and pull on nitrous balloons for 4 days straight without getting the shakes, cold sweats, and sleep hallucinations?
ive	in.	ive posted in rbnathome but ive always lurked here.  i went to bed last night wondering what a healthy, happy family looked like. . .  does anyone know what to look for? just so i know who i can place some trust in. 
Sparing	out.	Sparing details (the post would get a little long otherwise), I reached out.  I got put in needlessly difficult situations.  Talking to the therapist has done nothing but make me exponentially more anxious than I usually am for an hour and a half every week, and the medication hasn't taken effect (it takes a while to work apparently).  I'm just trying to say that, at this point, I just wish I killed myself those few months ago like I wanted to, instead of reaching out and potentially getting better.  The therapy money would've been better spent on some decent food for the family.  I regret everything. . . .  I'm sorry, I just had to let this out. 
Every	time.	Every time I use my mail key in the little bank of boxes in our building, they get left behind! It doesn't happen when there's no mail, but if there is mail, OHBOY.  I am still so excited about mail that it shoves the very existence of my keys out of my head and I leave them hanging out of the mail box.  They've been turned in to my landlady by a kind Samaritan 3 times.  I just went to pick them up and get the mail that's been waiting for a few days.  Yay! Mail! . . . you know what happened next.  I'm lucky nobody saw it this time. 
I've	ideas.	I've been dealing for the past month with the crash from my first manic episode that put me in the hospital for the first (and hopefully only) time. Right now I'm trying desperately to take care of myself but I have no appetite.  I'm managing barely 1000 calories a day and it's making it hard to keep up with normal exercise.  Nothing sounds good and every thing I eat is pretty much forced.  I've been doing okay with cereal in the morning, but the rest of the day I would rather do anything then even think about food.  So I was wondering what your go to meal/snack is.  Or the one thing you can't resist.  I'm a pretty good cook and I would love to get in the kitchen more but I need some ideas.  
I don't even feel guilty	caving in	How the hell do I deal with that.  My brain is some kind of silver tongued devil.  My inner monologue will make excuses, lie and *genuinely* convince myself I don't want to quit, to the point where  <e1> I don't even feel guilty </e1>  for  <e2> caving in </e2> . 
I	loved	I feel like I can't even do BPD right.  I wish I had had these intense intense romances or friendships or could see myself being really sexually active or poly or something.  ive always felt left out but not sure if i really wanted to be close to anyone? i have always felt like men were never interested in me, that i am completely unattractive, repulsive.  ive never felt a reason to think someone was interested, and am horrified at the thought of being that gross girl coming onto someone.  ive started doing dating apps and trying to go for it, fake it til i make it.  but i havent found anyone i'm particularly interested in? maybe one person who i was very into, but wasnt particularly sexually compatible with? is it an issue of me not liking people? is this normal?I want to be engulfed in love, but haven't really experienced love at all? A few friendships intense.  Maybe one crush? Is this something else wrong with me? I want to love and be loved
I've	sad	I've ruined my marriage and I just hurt, all over.  There isn't a hotline for I'm very sad
It dragged up some pretty heavy stuff and in the end I was told I would benefit from counselling and CBT sessions but they can only offer one at a time (NHS)	I'm being referred for CBT but I've been told there is a several month wait to see anyone	I had a consultation to assess where I am in regards to treatment for the anxiety I've been struggling with yesterday.  It was all over the phone and I felt so proud of myself for actually making it through it all.   <e1> It dragged up some pretty heavy stuff and in the end I was told I would benefit from counselling and CBT sessions but they can only offer one at a time (NHS) </e1> .  So  <e2> I'm being referred for CBT but I've been told there is a several month wait to see anyone </e2> .  So what now? I feel like I've been left hanging with no support.  Does anyone have any recommendations of things I could try myself in the meantime?  
To blame someone for not understanding you fully is deeply unfair	first of all, we don't understand ourselves	Just read this and thought I should share. Often I'm in my head too much.   Perhaps you are too.    <e1> To blame someone for not understanding you fully is deeply unfair </e1>  because  <e2> first of all, we don't understand ourselves </e2> , and even if we do understand ourselves, we have such a hard time communicating ourselves to other people.   Therefore to be furious and enraged and bitter that people don't get all of who we are is a really a cruel piece of immaturity.   Page 487 - tools of titans 
Depression	ruined my productivity and creativity	 <e1> Depression </e1>  has  <e2> ruined my productivity and creativity </e2> .  I've submitted substandard assignments throughout the entire of the last year and always at like the fifth extended deadline.  I've always loved writing and I'm an aspiring author, but it became very difficult to write anything and be proud of it.  This Feb, I felt normal for four days (I'd give anything to feel that again, that glorious normalcy) and was able to write an essay.  I'd forced myself to keep at the research before but I found the energy to put the essay together when I felt like myself, and it turned out pretty well.  Two days ago, I was called by the coordinator because she wouldn't believe that I had written that essay.  This is not the work of a sixteen-year-old
Thank you ALL for sharing your stories	why I have made it this far	I wanted to write some amazing insight on 1 year of sobriety.  But I realized that I have so much more to learn and grow.  Have faith in yourself and your ability to take control of you life.  I am slowly starting to see the joy in life and look forward to more clarity as I continue.   <e1> Thank you ALL for sharing your stories </e1> .  I believe you are part of the reason  <e2> why I have made it this far </e2> .  Do something that makes you happy today.  Today, like many others, I will not drink with you.  Cheers!
He expressed a bit of disappointment that being a homebody	made him miss out on social interaction	First of all- I don't want to take his games from him, or vise verse.   <e1> He expressed a bit of disappointment that being a homebody </e1>   <e2> made him miss out on social interaction </e2> , and I'm kinda outgoing (not super active but Im comfortable with it). .  I want to go from acquaintances to friends (maybe more down the line? Idk him well yet) with this guy
They	down.	They desperately grasp for anything that resemble help yet will tear it down with them if the helping person isn't careful and protects him/herself. And this thought is just making me cautious and possibly feel guilty.  I don't know how much I can let out.  I got enough to bring people down. 
about 4 weeks ago I told my two closest friends	I was depressed	Recently,  <e1> about 4 weeks ago I told my two closest friends </e1>  that  <e2> I was depressed </e2> .  After that they stopped talking to me ignoring them.  When I reached out to them again asking explicitly for help they got angry at me and no longer talk to me.  One has blocked me and the other ignores me.  I have gone from having two people I thought I could rely on to having no one.  Since then I have spiraled down even farther.  I haven't done to school all week, haven't talked to anyone and barely leave my room.  This was the worst possible outcome.  
I	cycle?	I need some advice.  I've been working a deadend job for the last 5 years, I've been trying to find something better but it seems like I'm stuck.  This job makes me feel tired, humiliated, and sad to the point where I would rather take my own life than get stuck until I retire.  I know that I'm alone in the long haul.  Can someone recommend a less painful method of suicide to end this cycle?
I	die	I suffer from bipolar 2 and I'm taking lexapro and lithium, but lately my depression is particularly crippling to what I call code blue.  This is where I am suicidal but my anxiety is so high I can't get out of bed.  I'm seeing my new psychiatrist next week, but I don't know how much more of this I can take.  Tldr: I'm suicidal but I'm afraid to die
I've	all?	I've been feeling like shit lately.  It jsut hit me a few weeks ago how lonely I am and how miserable I am.  I want to change but I can't bring myself to do anything about what I feel.  I know I need help and I have no one to talk to.  Is therapy really worth it? Does it help at all? 
Now I learned that that behavior is not typical	I learned the hard way after people took advantage of me	It's the only conclusion I can make after so long.  From the moment we're born, we're selfish - wanting food wanting milk wanting affection.  We don't have empathy, we learn it.  But that's a choice and some people choose to stay selfish.  So many people have been hurt by the actions of others which can be boiled down to selfishness at the cost of someone else.  Am I saying I'm a perfect angel? Of course not.  Ever since I became severely depressed I've just been focusing on how to get better and there's a certain selfishness in that.  But I wasn't always like this.  Before I used to care about other people and tried to help or make people happy even if it occasionally cost me.   <e1> Now I learned that that behavior is not typical </e1> , as  <e2> I learned the hard way after people took advantage of me </e2> . 
I	drink	I turned 30 and decided to make some changes.  Picking up a six pack on the way home from work and sucking down cigarettes all evening had been my unwinding ritual for a decade.  But I was starting to get a persistent cough that wouldn't go away.  And I felt slower and slower in the mornings, couldn't remember the details of conversations, found it harder and harder to concentrate for long periods of time. The first week - let's face it - sucked.  My brain was desperate.  If you can't drink
Pretty much daily I see people claiming to be depressed	they feel under the weather and down	 <e1> Pretty much daily I see people claiming to be depressed </e1>  because  <e2> they feel under the weather and down </e2> .  It's such a common thing that no one actually takes depression seriously, if you talk about it people will tell you everyone gets depressed sometimes and similar things.  I don't think these people have actually experienced depression though. Depression doesn't even necessarily manifest as feeling down
my phone unexpectedly broke, which was really stressful for me	I was waiting on an important phone interview for a job	I have been gray-rocking my nmom for over a year, and being away from home at university has helped tremendously.  As a result, however, she's long been scraping the bottom of the barrel to find things to get angry about with me. About a week ago,  <e1> my phone unexpectedly broke, which was really stressful for me </e1>  because  <e2> I was waiting on an important phone interview for a job </e2>  I really wanted and was told reparations through my carrier would take about 7-10 days and could not get a back up. Out of sheer panic, I asked my nmom if I could borrow the extra phone she has (used to be my dad's phone, but he is deceased and she isn't willing to let go of the phone number even though it's been more than 5 years).  She said Of course and rushed to give the phone to me.  I added my close friends who I talk to frequently to the phone and talked to them normally.  We happened to be planning a trip. The next day
Reminds	be/cH69PkrIihQ	Reminds me of when I was suffocating under the weight of my compulsion and how out of control my life was.  Can you connect with this guy? I can.  If you didn't know, a man died under his 6 ton porn collection.  It's been since reported that he actually died of a heart attack but either way, I'm so glad I'm on the other side of this addiction.   be/cH69PkrIihQ
Just	*Somehow	Just got a voicemail from my great aunt, sending me her prayers that things will be repaired in the family soon.  Wants everyone to be able to talk and be together again like we used to.  Says she's concerned for my sister;  says my sister would really like to be able to talk with me again. . . You mean the sister who texted me the day after my wedding that our relationship was over and not to talk to her again until I learn to respect our mother? The sister who reportedly told my cousin a few months ago to punch me in the face the next time she sees me? *Somehow
How	boring	How I describe growing up: normal and boring How it was: sad and lonely, nobody's businessThen I got married, to a man with a wonderful loving family, and they love me.  Like they really love me, when his mom asks about my hobbies she is actually legit interested in my interests and opinions.  It's like day and night compared to my parents.  The problem is that they don't just want to know my hobbies, they want to know everything about me.  It's gotten much worse since they recently found out I don't talk to my parents.  Now it's not just the random question about how my parents celebrated holidays; it's more like what hobbies did you do with your parents, what were your birthdays like, who drove you to school, what was family dinner like. . .  I can't use ormal and boring
I guess you'll see that I would disown my child	trashy disgusting behaviour	Alright so this situation is completely fucked.  Basically, my mom is super insecure and very conservative.  She has sent me many messages over the past year on and off about how disgusting I am for being a dancer.  (not that this should matter, but we do not go any less clothing than bra and full underwear).  She calls me slut, whore, stripper, disgrace, skank, etc.  She sent me this msg: What you do on stage goes against everything I believe in and I cannot watch your life go this way.  I just can't express enough how much it goes against my morals and values.  But  <e1> I guess you'll see that I would disown my child </e1>  for such  <e2> trashy disgusting behaviour </e2> .  **You might as well be a pedophile.  ** (LOL WHAT)You don't understand
This	humour	This came from a post I submitted here a few weeks ago about my Nparent, I was talking to another fellow redditor who commented and part of my reply was: &gt;It's as if there's no way I'm capable of making my own decisions for my own assurance or satisfaction.  God no, it has to be because everything I did has to have her name hash-tagged behind it. The said redditor found it hilarious that I used such a description towards my Nmum's attitude, and insisted that I share it with you guys! Because it doesn't hurt to sometimes treat shitty situations with a bit of humour, I started to make up ridiculous hashtags that you would see in one of those excessive instagram captions.  For example:My SO and I are enjoying this great movie date! Love Batman Begins! # mumhere # whenwasthis # howcomeyoudidnttellme # idontlikebatman # whydoyouevenwatchstufflikethis # didhepayfortheticket # howaboutpopcorn # hesnotgoodforyou # memememememememememememememememememePlease feel free to post any sarcastic examples that you have in mind! :) This is purely for fun and harmless humour
No	it.	No family.  No friends.  No significant other.  I have a set date to kill myself.  If I'm not happy or at least out of my depression by that date I'm ending it.  
this is so hard for me	I will think at least 100 times of what I have to say	Hi all, I have recently got a new job, and last week was my first week, and I have a severe case of social anxiety.  I have been to therapy previously in regards to overthinking, social anxiety, and depression, and they referred me to have CBT, which has helped me to an extent, but I am still awkward and shy when it comes to talking to people. This week I have been given tasks to go up to my colleagues and talk to them about some planning,  <e1> this is so hard for me </e1>  because  <e2> I will think at least 100 times of what I have to say </e2> , and then I will just bottle everything in and not say anything and miss out on a great deal of work.  How would I overcome this? I even find it awkward to talk on the phone, and to say people's names, this is causing me all sorts of frustration and I want to overcome this. Any tips? 
It	it?	It is an anti-hypertensive that helps inhibit the sympathetic nervous system.  Anyone tried it? I tried it once and got a headache that lasted for hours.  Anyone else had success with it? 
I	sobriety!	I am at another point in my sobriety which seemed impossible to me such a short time ago.  500 days without a hangover.  Roughly $ 5,000 not spent on booze.  I feel great physically and mentally, like I'm firing on all cylinders for once in my life.  I have had some thoughts of trying to drink moderately, but I play that tape forward to it's inevitable conclusion, and I know that I am simply better off without it.  Nothing good ever comes from drinking.  There is always a price to pay.  Sometimes that price is big, and sometimes it's small, but I have no control over the size once I start ingesting alcohol.  Thanks for being here people of SD! Having this community is a great reminder of the negative consequences of drinking, and also the positive outcomes that can come from abstaining.  It has been an invaluable tool in my toolbox, and I want to thank all of you.  You are an inspiration to me sober people of SD! I am proud to not drink with you on this milestone of my sobriety!  
Started	them.	Started meditating religiously as a new years resolution, which led me to make the decision to stop gaming. It's been a few days now, but I realize that I've been going to other things almost without even really thinking about it (Sugar, caffeine, marijuana, porn, social media) in place of video games to kill time.  What are some things you found yourselves doing in place of your video game addiction? I realize that I should be picking up other hobbies, which I have been, but I feel that this really sheds light on how and why you choose to make certain decisions throughout your day, even subconsciously.  I'd like to hear more about your experiences with quitting and how you handled them.  
I	help!!	I am a pathologically shy person who barely has any friends.  I am a social recluse.  Every time I come online and watch the activities of my friends it gives me an anxiety attack.  I feel like a sore ass loser who has no idea about anything and every one else has all the knowledge.  I feel very worthless.  Please someone help!!
Call	honestly	Call me crazy or whatever, but I. . . . . I don't know.  I just love the emotional pain.  I love the crying.  That pain drives me and keeps me awake.  The pain that stabs me in the heart is something that I don't mind.  Depression in general is my life.  Sure I'll enjoy life and be kind of happy for most of the day but towards the end of the day, I'm just tired and hoping for tomorrow.  Depression kept me alive and well.  Depression has made me realize that honestly
it happened a fair few months ago now.  A car pulled out in front of me at the bottom of a hill when I was on my bicycle	I slid right into the side of it at about 18mph	I have,  <e1> it happened a fair few months ago now.  A car pulled out in front of me at the bottom of a hill when I was on my bicycle </e1>  and  <e2> I slid right into the side of it at about 18mph </e2> .  My bike was written off completely but I was thankfully okay bar a sprained wrist and a few bruises. The weirdest thing happened though.  For a short while immediately afterwards I felt normal, the brain fog had lifted, I felt entirely coherent.  Normally when answering questions I feel like I have to sift through a world of information before finding the answer - even with questions like, what is your name, how old are you or would you like a coffee I usually seem to take a little longer to answer than I should - but not when I am knocked down by a car. . .  I don't intend to make a habit of it though. . . 
Of course I hesitated	all the abuse I've faced from Nmom about what I wear and what I like	Went to TJ Maxx today with my boyfriend who was willing to buy whatever I wanted.   <e1> Of course I hesitated </e1>  because of  <e2> all the abuse I've faced from Nmom about what I wear and what I like </e2> .  I found this adorable set of a crop top and skirt.  It was matching blue and white stripes.  I put it on and absolutely fell in love with it.  I decided to purchase it despite that little voice in the back of my head saying that I didn't deserve it and that I looked fat in it.  I didn't care and I'm so glad I bought it.  
I	PERSON!	I just got into one of the top six law schools in the country.  I have had to work SO HARD to focus on my goals and accomplish things in life.  But I got myself to college, through college, through five years of working and living in New York, and earned myself an acceptance from a top law school.  I included a second personal statement in my application describing how I kept my focus despite the difficulties I faced, and I think it helped.  I'm glad I wrote it.  Still waiting on decisions from the other five schools, but even if I don't get into any others, I've gotten into one great one.  It is possible to succeed.  It is.  Getting myself here has been challenging in ways I cannot even describe.  But I did it.  You can do it too.  Never give up.  We can still win. Edit: I got into another top school, even better than the first!!!!! AND SOMEONE GAVE ME REDDIT GOLD THANK YOU, YOU GENEROUS WONDERFUL PERSON!
I	alcohol.	I am one of those who get addicted to anything that gives me dopamine kicks: alcohol, drugs, gambling, porn - you name it.  All of these things destroy my life and if I start to do one of them, I will start to abuse daily right away. I am currently 2 weeks sober and 5 days without porn.  I feel irritated all the time and have a slight heavy feeling in my head constantly.  Is there anyone else here fighting porn addiction at the same time as you are trying to become sober? How are you dealing with it and what is your story? ****This has nothing to do with religious stuff, crazy nofap-belief and all of that.  I just know that dopamine abuse drains out my soul, whether its porn or alcohol.  
So	:)	So glad to have made it this far.  Feeling infinitely better already, but really should have read up on the side effects of withdrawl before going cold turkey :)
Gaming	All!	Gaming has taken quite a few hours/days/years of my life and I'm glad I found a group like this to track my progress and keep this new habit going.  I have a lot more time to concentrate on more productive tasks and sort my life out. Thanks All!
don't control your breathing	then you're going to start manually controlling it	One of my main symptoms of anxiety has been thinking  <e1> don't control your breathing </e1>  because  <e2> then you're going to start manually controlling it </e2>  which then starts a vicious cycle of me controlling it/ thinking I will think of it forever.  Any tips on this? (if anyone has gone through it too). 
I	anxiety.	I know that marijuana is becoming a popular alternative to treat anxiety instead of benzo prescriptions, so how well has that worked for you? I know that a possible side effect of weed is panic attacks, which obviously seems counterproductive.  Is it very dose specific? Does how you consume it matter? Does time and place of consumption matter? I just am very curious about how MMJ (in a legal state or not) has been used to help so many people with anxiety. 
I	now.	I made it 2 weeks without using marijuana but I had a moment of weakness this weekend and got pretty stoned.  It wasn't fun or enlightening and I just felt guilty about it the whole time.  I have very noticeable grogginess and fog today with a side of lack of motivation.  Since I don't have a time machine, I can't do anything about it now, except to dust myself off and move on.  I'm back to day 2 now.  
They said I fell asleep in my truck outside the bar and had to smash my window	I wouldn't wake up when they knocked on my window	Drinking has been a bit of an issue for a long time and I haven't acknowledged it until two days ago when I woke up in the police station.   <e1> They said I fell asleep in my truck outside the bar and had to smash my window </e1>  because  <e2> I wouldn't wake up when they knocked on my window </e2> .  A list of things that has occurred because of alcohol is I died once, flipped canoe hammered in the middle of the lake, lost friends, respect of family and really my self respect.  Today is day two of no drinking and I plan to continue this.  Luckily I still have my job but a dui and truck impoundment really made me open my eyes.  This stops now.  
And	.	And I am already dreading tomorrow. today was just a day to pick up forms, i had to take the truck in to the mechanic and that was it.  I spent the two hours chatting with my new boss, and we were old co-workers not even stressful.  but I am anxious as fuck for tomorrow. . . 
What can/should I do to help her? She lives abroad	I can only talk to her via phone and I don't know how insurance/counseling works in her country	A very good friend of mine suffers from bulimia.  As far as I know, I'm the only one who knows about it.  I've known for about a year and tried to help her find help.  I know that it's almost impossible to get someone to get help for themselves if they don't want it but I'm really concerned about her health.  She's still at a healthy weight, but her mental health suffers a lot from her struggles.   <e1> What can/should I do to help her? She lives abroad </e1> , so  <e2> I can only talk to her via phone and I don't know how insurance/counseling works in her country </e2> .  
I'm	nightmares?	I'm fairly anxious the majority of the time and have been trying to slap it into place for the past 8 years.  But recently after a move I've been losing sleep, getting awful nightmares and waking up with panic attacks. Could anyone provide any tips? I've already tried the following before if this helps shorten the process:Medicine, which I've decided I'll never try again.  Therapy, such as CBT, Group, targetted, one on one and councelling.  ATM, I'm doing councelling.  But how do I tackle the nightmares? 
I guess they have a good cop/bad cop thing going on	the lead therapist can be super aggressive while her trainee is pretty sweet and laidback	I've been going to group therapy for the past month or so.  There are two facilitators.   <e1> I guess they have a good cop/bad cop thing going on </e1>  because  <e2> the lead therapist can be super aggressive while her trainee is pretty sweet and laidback </e2> . I can't tell if the lead therapist is actually really mean or if she's trying to push us to do things.  But there have been times where she's just been a straight jerk.  For instance two weeks ago a girl was struggling to express herself and she laughed at her and was like Oh
I	this?	I absolutely adore her to pieces but I can't stop thinking about it being wrong or not right. I just want the thoughts to stop.  I just want to be happy. I just want to be with her and not worry. Its gotten so bad I have constant headaches and developed back aches from it. I worry she likes me more than I like her.  I feel guilty and ashamed of myself for having any doubts at all. Why does it have to be like this?
I	tonight	I easily drink a bottle of wine a night, maybe a glass more, or less.   I feel anxious without it.   I feel sad without it.   When I say I'm not going to drink tonight
When I came home I had a bit of a cold and sore throat	I didn't smoke for a few days	A couple of weeks ago I came home after a long weekend in Portland where I spent a lot of time smoking and drinking.   <e1> When I came home I had a bit of a cold and sore throat </e1>  so  <e2> I didn't smoke for a few days </e2> .  The cold went away, the sore throat didn't.  I looked in my mouth a few days ago and there were these weird bumps all over the back of my tongue.  Turns out my taste buds are irritated and swollen from smoking too much, and the only way they'll go back to normal is if I stop smoking.  I had a half of a cigarette yesterday and threw the rest of my pack and all tobacco products out.  I'm really hoping I can stay quit this time. 
I got let go from my job today	they noticed I was unhappy	 <e1> I got let go from my job today </e1>  when  <e2> they noticed I was unhappy </e2> , I've been looking for a job for nearly 3 years and when I finally get one I lose it on the second day.  I was on the verge of tears all day, I thought I'd be happy to get a job but there was barely anything to do and the hours were so long and there was a dog in the office and I'm scared of dogs.  That's all, I just wanted to vent
I	people.	I was supposed to do something today due to extreme but just didn't do it and it was really important in regards to college.  Loads of people having been blowing up my phone and I'm too embarrassed to talk to people.  
it doesn't feel like it works at all	I'm getting more and more discouraged and feel worse every day	Hey all,I've been trying and failing to use self affirmations and disapprovals for the multitudes of intrusive and distorted thoughts that I have on a daily basis, and  <e1> it doesn't feel like it works at all </e1> .   <e2> I'm getting more and more discouraged and feel worse every day </e2>  because of it.  Does anyone have any experience with this or have any advice on how to tackle this? It's so overwhelming at this point I just don't try. 
I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years and I just woke up one day and decided to go Cold Turkey with the help from  com/	the First few weeks were not so bad, I even made it through a party with a lot of beer drinking	I decided to quit 31 days ago.   <e1> I was a pack a day smoker for 15 years and I just woke up one day and decided to go Cold Turkey with the help from  com/ </e1> .  So  <e2> the First few weeks were not so bad, I even made it through a party with a lot of beer drinking </e2> .  But the last week has been really tough I'm thinking of smoking all day it feels like.  I have been eyeballing the gas station down the street from the house on my way home from work every night.  I have this crave deep in the pit of my stomach I figured this would start fading by now.  I have been thinking of all the good times I had with my smokes.  I feel like I can't complete anything without smoking and this part of who I am is now missing. 
I	head.	I wonder if it is a problem people with ADHD have where they have difficulty communicating to others.  Whether it's telling a story, or trying to get a point across I always feel like I'm not doing a good job of it.  Often times I stray or like what happened to me yesterday I got distracted and the words in my head of what I was going to say next went poof literally mid-story.  TLDR: Have a hard time communicating what it is in my head.  
I	same?	I have an anxiety disorder.  What ever I do, does not matter where I am, my brain is always telling me I suck.  Tells me that I'm nothing.  I try to concentrate in my classes, but all I can think about is everything I've done wrong and how stupid I have been.  I can not turn it off.  Is killing me inside.  Is gotten to the point where maybe a nice bullet will end the suffering of so much blame and anguish.  My friends are transferring to schools and I am stuck.  The succeed more and more while I fail.  I am of a low income, live in a small place with my parents with no privacy.  Everyone I know has it all.  All I have is myself, and he wants to take the easy way out.  I'm jobless, loveless, and have a bad body and face.  I just want to end it all.  Someone feels the same?
I knew the location but not where in the location	ofc, I left the email telling me where to go at work.  Eventually I found it	Today was. . . . . frustrating and I need to vent to people who understand (if that is ok).  Today I attended training for work.  It was good I more or less paid attention and got some good ideas.  Afterwards I had a meeting to go to.   <e1> I knew the location but not where in the location </e1>  because,  <e2> ofc, I left the email telling me where to go at work.  Eventually I found it </e2> . . . On my way out, I tried to go through the wrong door to leave the room.  I managed to walk into two people, almost got on the wrong train, when I got on the right train I realized after two stops that I wasn't sure i was on the right one. The funny part is, the training was on Time Management and Self Leadership. . . . I feel seriously irritated and embarrassed with myself atm. Thanks for reading.  
I	terribly	I recently moved across the country to Boston and started school while simultaneously quitting kratom.  Well I am back in my hometown and the cravings have been OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I went to an old head shop just to browse their supply.  It turns out they had boxes of the old vivazen kratom shots and I impulsively bought 2 boxes.  I have obsessed over them but have not dranken them and I even cracked one open and smelled it.  I don't know what to do.  I am craving so terribly
My nmom often tells me I have no reason to be angry	she is the most wonderful parent	 <e1> My nmom often tells me I have no reason to be angry </e1>  because  <e2> she is the most wonderful parent </e2> .  Does your nparent claim this 
To	habits?	To cut to the chase: often, while I'm stressed, I'll start doing certain patterns with my hands (like, tapping, or drawing spirals) to count up to 10.  And if counting to 10 doesn't feel right, then I'll have to do the same patterns to 100.  If I lose count, I have to start over.  They're very subtle patterns - I could do them while watching TV with my boyfriend, or even out to drinks with friends, but they're starting to frustrate me.  Last night, I decided to just stop (I was watching TV with my boyfriend), but felt every time we touched or I stroked him, the counting came back again, as if automatically.  My therapist says a lot of getting better is just dealing with the uncertainty and not finishing it, and I try to do that, but it doesn't seem very practical/concrete: what are concrete things you do to get out of those habits?
I	go.	I don't feel like doing anything.  I'm sick of people telling me I'm smart, I can do things, I just need to do it, motivation will come later.  I don't want to do anything.  I don't want to work, I don't care about classes.  I'll pick up a game I used to love playing and quit before I've even gotten past the title screen.  I'm tired of singing and playing music.  I can't even sit down and pay attention to  TV.  Sometimes I think about leaving, but I don't have a clue where I'd go. 
When	advance.	When I'm on Ativan, I feel like a completely different person.  Like the real me that can and wants to talk to people where I don't feel this 'thing' that holds be back from doing so.  That inner fearful feeling just quiets out.  That being said, does anyone have recommendations for an SSRI that works as well as Ativan? Something long term? I tried going on Zoloft for a while but I felt no effects.  Thanks in advance. 
I'm afraid to seek help	I don't want to risk my medical certification and my career	I'm an airline pilot.   I take my job very seriously, and it's the greatest part of my life.   I do not consider myself at risk of self harm, nor do I feel the need to act out on others.   I'm just sad a lot, and am a lonely person.   Sometimes it's unbearable, and doing something like going to work is the only thing that can put a little bit of distance between myself and what I'm feeling.    <e1> I'm afraid to seek help </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want to risk my medical certification and my career </e2> .   Is there any way I can take a first step towards talk or drug therapy in a way that won't raise any flags or be legally traceable by my job or the FAA?
When	ADHD.	When I was younger my mom tried to force me to take piano lessons, and at first I did pretty well, but eventually I got bored of it easily and. . .  had a hard time slowing down &amp; playing all of the music at the same tempo.  Instead I'd rush through it, and when I made a mistake, I wouldn't slow down. Now that I'm medicated I've been toying with the idea of buying a cheap keyboard &amp; playing around with it, but it's been ages and I never developed an intuition for being able to improv or anything like that. TL;DR: I want to learn an instrument now that I'm medicated but am wondering if there are any specific techniques to learning that exist for those with ADHD. 
Eventually it spiraled out of control	all the emotionally taxing shit I had to deal with	I used to smoke weed daily, mainly to help sleep.   <e1> Eventually it spiraled out of control </e1>  because of  <e2> all the emotionally taxing shit I had to deal with </e2> , so I started being constantly stoned (with dabs) to try to suppress it, and that went on for a few years.  Last weekend I decided enough was enough.  No more weed, no more fapping, no more drugs.  No more dopaminergics.  My reward system was waaaay out of balance (and still is for the most part)I've made it to day 4 now, had a little issues sleeping but I seem to be doing better with that.  I feel waaay more clear headed already, my friends say I respond to things more quickly, it's easier to focus, shyness is going away, and I'm actually starting to feel happy again.  This morning I took a shower and it actually felt nice.  I met a girl in college and it went well, it felt good.  I feel more alive than I have in the past 4 years, i never would've thought being sober would feel so good!
approaching	.	approaching the end of day 3 successfully.  Had a hard time when my dad called, we usually talk a few times a week at beer thirty, and my instinct is to grab a cigarette and a beer and sit outside while talking to him.  i tried laying down in bed for a while, that was uncomfortable, then sat at the kitchen table chewing tea tree toothpicks for the rest of the conversation.  it was ok.  i think next time he calls / i call him  i will make some tea. . . . 
It	was	It doesn't feel good, when you barely have any friends who understand youIt doesn't feel good, when your family, your parents, all have doubts about you, and feel that you're upto something wrongIt doesn't feel good, not being able to make any friends despite trying like crazyIt doesn't feel good, that despite your talents, you always get compared to and humiliated against people who are better than youFuck it.  I just wanna erase myself from the timeline.  Not just stop existing, but as if I never was
Like, calling the police	a knife-wielding maniac is refusing to leave stressful	. . . but tomorrow will be my first shift since quitting. Getting through a whole shift without smoking is always a challenge.  I work days, so I get the privilege of cleaning the patio before opening.  There are cigarette butts everywhere.  Always a trigger.  Sometimes I find whole cigs or even partial packs while cleaning. Then I have hours with few customers, when there is little to do but clean and restock.  It can get boring.  I'm so used to taking five minutes for a smoke every hour on the slow days.  I haven't found anything to replace it with. My job isn't stressful very often, but when it is, it is *very* stressful.   <e1> Like, calling the police </e1>  because  <e2> a knife-wielding maniac is refusing to leave stressful </e2> .  When that happens, I always have a smoke to calm my nerves. So, mainly I'm just asking you all to keep me in your thoughts tomorrow.  I'd be happy to hear any suggestions you might have for staying smoke-free when I'm surrounded by work-related triggers, too. 
For	there	For me, I get these euphoric highs where I'm reading a good story or music or interacting with certain people or having too much funSometimes I get too excited with certain people or situations and I end up in stupid crap.  Like one time my friends and I were jokingly sliding things around into the air hockey table and I actually slid my college ID card in there
I	this?	I have depression and severe anxiety.  I'm in my first-year of university with no friends.  Since September I've been crying myself to sleep every night and have been brainstorming ways to kill myself since November.  However, recently even though I am still sad and depressed, I find myself unable to cry.  I feel numb and empty and I want to cry, yet I physically can't.  Has anyone else experienced this?
Stopped	ugh/vent	Stopped drinking completely for a couple weeks, felt great.  Completely derailed this weekend- blacked out from noon Friday until Sunday night.  I've had plenty of benders and not been this sick, not for this long at least.  I'm just now able to hold down water, my head is still pounding.  I know wd can last a while but not from such a short spree?Is that normal? The mental shame I'm feeling isn't helping ugh/vent
I feel so alone	i isolated myself, and lost all contact with my friends	Lately i haven't been eating right, Nutrient deficient half the time.  I'm just so tired of living, I have been depressed for as long as i can remember.    <e1> I feel so alone </e1>  because  <e2> i isolated myself, and lost all contact with my friends </e2> .  I'm the only one to blame for my problems besides my dead beat father.   I hate my parents for leaving me alone in this world, If i don't find a reason to live soon, i'm going out like Kurt. 
I	could?	I dont know why i live anymore, i suck in every aspect of life, nothing good ever happens to me.  In uni im probably the worst in class i never done anything good in there if not others helping me i would be out.  I have zero social life, never had a girlfriend nor i did have any normal relationship with the girl.  I dont have to whom to talk to and im fucking sad every fucking day, only thing that gives joy to me is gym all the other things are to just exist.  What the hell is point of life of you failed everywhere where you could?
I'm	before?	I'm currently a 16 year old guy who has been depressed their whole life.  This year I've had some of the close people in my life reach out to me.  I have avoided talking to people before this. I tried talking to them, they all made me feel like they cared.  Long story short, I realized no one cares about me.  Everyone walks away.  They would think I'm some sort of a psycho. I've had some meetings with the councilor, we somehow started talking about this.  She seems like she wants to help.  She also looks like she can help.  I'm really afraid of opening up to her.  I don't want to go through the same process of trusting someone so much and telling them so much information just to be left out at the end really hurt more than before. How do I trust her the same way I did with other people before?
I'm	possible.	I'm interested to know why you are depressed, narrow it down as much as possible.  
I	slave?	I seem to be the Scapegoat of my family.  Nothing I do can ever be right and it's 'just not good enough'.  It's taken me so long (I'm 20) to realise that I only started my degree in a feeble attempt to get NMum's approval, not my own and needless to say it's failing miserably.  I've been verbally, emotionally and on the rare occasion physically abused.  I've been manipulated, gaslighted, humiliated and projected.  I could go on and on and on. But Golden Children of Reddit, what's life like for you? Because I doubt it could be sunshine and roses.  You may be NParent's favourite but to me that's like being Crewella's favourite pup, or the Evil Step-mother's favourite slave? 
I	perform.	I used to be superwoman at work and supermom at home.  I was so capable of handling things before my onset.  I am a year out of my hospital program and assigned a bunch of new projects at work.  My bosses boss said they are counting on me and I need to deliver.  I just can't focus without better add medicine.  Energy drinks are just not cutting it. At home my house is a mess and my son is getting bad grades.  I can't even help him with his homework all of the time because I don't understand how they do common core.  I am slowly cracking and I'm afraid I might break at any time.  I desperately want to get back on stimulants for add but obviously don't want to trigger psychosis.  I see my pdoc in 2 weeks and I don't know if I can last that long.  I just want to curl into a hole and block out the world.  The stakes are so high at work right now that I'm sure I'll get let go if I don't perform. 
almost	venting	almost every day i think about offing myself.  like i'll just be chilling and playing a video game when suddenly i get this urge to just swallow a bunch of pills or slice my own throat. the thing is that i'm not sure why.  my problems are minimal when you look at the fact that i wanna die.  i've had depressive symptoms in the past (never diagnosed though) but it's gotten better.  but maybe it's still there? if anything i might just be bored with life and bad at handling pressurei dunno man i guess i'm just venting
My grades are not the best	I simply DO NOT GIVE A SHIT	I do not know what is wrong but I do not feel anything towards anything.  I am 17 years old and going to college next year.  EveryoneI know has somewhat of an idea of what they want to do.  I do not have any idea of what I want to do, nor the area.  I do not even have the motivation to do anything.  I am the most confused and lost person I have ever met.  I simply do not have any motivation to do anything at all.  I could sleep all day and be content.   <e1> My grades are not the best </e1>  because  <e2> I simply DO NOT GIVE A SHIT </e2> .  I don't give a shit for anything in my life even friends, two exceptions.  It feels as if I am just going through the motions of life.  Like everything is on the surface and there is no deeper meaning.  I workout and eat healthy.  I have been told I am pretty attractive.  But all these things seem so surface.  They all go away in time and I do not want to do with my life.  Simply put life has lost its shine. 
Super	stuck.	Super nervous even though I shouldn't be.  It's my first actually actual DAY 1 as well, tried a bunch this month, but this week it stuck.  
My	myself.	My depression has been so bad lately, and I'm so disappointed with the way my life is going.  All I want to do is pack all my things and move across country.  I want to start a new life somewhere, change my name, cut off contact with everybody I know.  If I don't get out of my current lifestyle, I'm afraid I might kill myself.  
I'm so nervous to tell people	I'm scared they won't believe I have a valid mental illness	If so what was their reaction?  <e1> I'm so nervous to tell people </e1>  because  <e2> I'm scared they won't believe I have a valid mental illness </e2> .  My Mum once told me I was just not able to cope with life like a normal person when I tried to open up to her about it
I hope I get sometime of response to this	a lot of things are weighing on my mind and it's made me more depressed than usual	 <e1> I hope I get sometime of response to this </e1>  because  <e2> a lot of things are weighing on my mind and it's made me more depressed than usual </e2> . Let me start with this.  I'm a fuck up in life.  I can admit to that.  People usually say well don't say about yourself and focus on positive things! I don't have many or any positive things going on in my life. I'm 30 years old
Ever since quitting	I have been constipated	so. . .  throughout my life, I've only had smelly farts when I had to poo.   Outside of times when I have to poo, my farts were very mild.   I never had a problem farting around people or my gf's in a closed room and car.   I just held them when I was nearing my poo time. . .   <e1> Ever since quitting </e1> .    <e2> I have been constipated </e2> .   I have difficulty pooing every day.   I used to poo twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.   They were always wonderful poos that were quick and gratifyingly emptying.   Now my poos don't feel complete, and each turd feels like a mission squeezing out. Has anyone else dealt with this?  All of my farts stink to high hell.   It's at the point that I keep my window open all day now and I flap my bedsheets to avoid dutch ovening myself.   I feel ridiculous saying this lol. 
How to forgive her	she ruined my self-esteem	All my childhood my mom(and my uncle) called me ugly.  She said my brother was beautiful but I'm ugly. Since then I have become shy and afraid of women.  i always think i'm not good enough for the women i like.  I'm in my 30's.   <e1> How to forgive her </e1>  cause  <e2> she ruined my self-esteem </e2> , and sometimes i harm myself?
I need some advise	I have never had real friends because of abuse I suffered while in my youth and teens	Hey guys, first time posting here.   <e1> I need some advise </e1>  because  <e2> I have never had real friends because of abuse I suffered while in my youth and teens </e2> .  Now I am a 23/F.  I work, I go to college (not in the US). I know I NEED to make friends, my therapist is helping.  It's just I find it so exhausting talking to people and making small conversation.  I don't know how to start a conversation, and keep it sort of smoothly.  I am constantly afraid of my weirdness or overstepping boundaries, or looking weird.  How do I practice talking to people, and not exhaust myself in the process? What phrases or structures, tips, can you recommend? Thanks!!
I	today.	I saw a guy earlier today, he was walking as I drove, I was stuck in traffic and I glimpsed him and noticed how ill he looked.  I recognised that look, the look of someone ravaged by alcohol abuse then I saw through the carrier bag he had 8 cans of super-strength lager and i felt for him but it reaffirmed my commitment to abstinence and forgoing that first drink.  If you'd have seen him you'd know precisely why i feel how I do right now.  My heart goes out to him.  I'm so happy not drinking with you today.  
The thing is I am 17 and my mum doesn't allow me to take them	apparently they are addictive	Hey, I'm currently having an anxiety attack.  I think.  I have awful health anxiety and I got prescribed pills to calm down from psychiatrist.   <e1> The thing is I am 17 and my mum doesn't allow me to take them </e1>  because  <e2> apparently they are addictive </e2> .  I can't think of anything else everyday.  I feel like shit.  She says that it's my fault that I'm stressed out and need to just fucking calm down.  She basically just yells at me. What to do.  I've never been on this sub, I am just asking for some advice to calm down, I literally feel like I'm dying.  Doesn't matter what I do, I can't think of anything else. Sorry for my english. 
So	it	So as the title says, i cant really stop. .  i really have to stop and be sober, i really have to quit but in almost half a decade i have never gone a full week without it.  its crazy, my mind is fucked, i cant think straight, i don't know whether i'm anxious, depressed, or just another high paranoia.  i don't know i feel lost, there are so many problems in my life that i need to work on and deal with them.  please any support or advice would be really appreciated.  i don't why i'm writing this down right now, it feels therapeutical. And my social life is miserable, all my friends are stoners.  i try to go out but i have some kind of rollercoaster emotion stability, like all of a sudden i get to feel so depressed that i cant be positive on anything.  and also, i have been long time lurker here, i read all of your posts, like some days i will say to myself his is it
developing a terminal illness, which makes me feel beyond terrible	I want what others would do anything not to experience	I used to be suicidal, but now I just fantasise about being in an accident, or  <e1> developing a terminal illness, which makes me feel beyond terrible </e1>  because  <e2> I want what others would do anything not to experience </e2> .  Am I even suicidal or have I progressed to another stage on the road to content? I think about death way more than I used to, I'm dreaming about it, I actually can't remember a single hour I didn't think about it, even when I'm gaming, but I know in myself I don't have it in me to try anything. I don't know what I'm even trying to say, I just felt the need to express. 
I was facing the prospect of having to check myself into the ER	my mind justified a relapse	I will spare readers from expressions of shame, because although I'd much rather be on Day 10 than Day 0, I'm optimistic due to the experiences I had through my early successes. The insomnia hit me hard and was definitely the most unexpected of the withdrawal symptoms.   I was approaching 4 days without any sleep, and  <e1> I was facing the prospect of having to check myself into the ER </e1> , so  <e2> my mind justified a relapse </e2>  -- it seemed the only way I could make it into work and avoid potential hospital bills. But then, of course, I kept using each of the following 5 days. . . truly a disease. So I'm back at the starting line.   The improvements that I was uncovering on a day-to-day basis, despite it being so early in recovery, are enough of a motivation for me to want to kick permanently.   Knowing about the insomnia issue, I just need to be prepared and have coping mechanisms in place. If anyone has any advice, that would be humbly appreciated of course.   But I mostly just wanted to vent, journal this setback, and record my renewed intention of making it to Day 30 and beyond towards infinity.  
I	destructive.	I want to stop existing.  I feel like existing is hurting too many people.  I have always really wanted to stop existing.  Not die, just cease to be a person.  Recently, I feel like all I do is hurt the people around me.  All I want is for my friends to be happy and loved yet somehow all I am is destructive.  
i	out.	i broke down and cried about how much of a crap my life is.  why am i so different from everyone.  i wish i was never born if this is how my life's gonna turn out. 
it wasn't really voluntarily	I either was overseas in a foreign land or had no money hook ups to get any	As the title says, day 2 over and done with, last night was rough.  Insomnia sucks, although I have been using it to stay up for my newborn son's late night  early morning feeds, but I am definitely looking forward to being able to sleep on my own without the need for weed.  I know I can do it, I have been able to do it before (although  <e1> it wasn't really voluntarily </e1>  as  <e2> I either was overseas in a foreign land or had no money hook ups to get any </e2> ).  The hardest part for me is the boredom.  Everything that I could do endlessly while stoned just feels so empty now that I'm thinking straight.  Now it's hours lying in bed, either trying to sleep unsuccessfully or trying not to think about weed.  Let's hope tomorrow night goes better
I've gotten two EKGs	I'm pretty sure I'm fine	I'll preface this by saying  <e1> I've gotten two EKGs </e1>  in the past 6 months during episodes of intense panic and symptoms so  <e2> I'm pretty sure I'm fine </e2> .  I guess I shouldn't say constant but it happens often.  I even wake up with it.  Sometimes it's pain, or tightness or just a weird sensation in my chest.  When I'm anxious my mind goes straight to heart issues but I don't think that's the case.  It's more likely acid reflux related but even when I can convince myself of that the feeling wears on me and makes me more susceptible to panic and anxiety.  How do I deal with this? Wtf is it? I go to the doctor again next week but considering past experience I doubt they'll help me.  
My doctor prescribed me 40mg right off the bat for 3 months	I'm wondering has this been the case for anyone else	I read that it's better to start on Strattera on a low dose and gradually adjust higher.   <e1> My doctor prescribed me 40mg right off the bat for 3 months </e1>  and  <e2> I'm wondering has this been the case for anyone else </e2> ?I just took my first dose today. Edit: Has there been anyone that started on 40mg and wasn't through side-effect hell?
I were afraid of him	he always used the if you tell you'll be in trouble line on us	Ok, settle in it's a long story, I'm giving you the condensed version.  My sister(22F)  and I(26f) were molested as well as just generally abused when we were kids by our father(50's?M). . .  who was also pretty abusive to our mother(50's?F) . . .  Me from about 4 till I was 11ish and her from about the same time, he was a stay at home parent, so while I was at school, he'd abuse her, and then both of us together when I got home. . . Her and  <e1> I were afraid of him </e1> , and  <e2> he always used the if you tell you'll be in trouble line on us </e2> 
This is probably not healthy coping but I have these places I like to zone out and pretend I'm in, with people that love me and treat me like a person, and I feel more normal and real in my own made up worlds than in real life	In real life I just feel small and sad and useless	 <e1> This is probably not healthy coping but I have these places I like to zone out and pretend I'm in, with people that love me and treat me like a person, and I feel more normal and real in my own made up worlds than in real life </e1> .   <e2> In real life I just feel small and sad and useless </e2> .  Is this normal or should I stop this?
I don't want to be like this	I'm destroying my relationships with people and even hurting my abilities to maintain a job	My parents tell me I was a happy child, but for as long as I can remember anger has always been a major concern in my life.  I guess it must have started around the time I hit puberty and it's just something I have never been able to manage.  I am now 24 and my anger has manifested itself into a down right rage.  The smallest things can set off a whirlwind fire storm of of cussing, screaming, throwing things, saying things I don't mean and ultimately when it's over I end up being unable to recall everything that I had done.  It's like I'm so quick to unravel that I don't even realize what has happened before it's too late.   <e1> I don't want to be like this </e1> .   <e2> I'm destroying my relationships with people and even hurting my abilities to maintain a job </e2> .  I'm tired of this. 
It's almost aggravating	trying to explain to ppl why I don't like him makes me sound petty	I have to say, compared to most ppl here my ndad isn't that bad.   <e1> It's almost aggravating </e1>  because  <e2> trying to explain to ppl why I don't like him makes me sound petty </e2> . My BF was on the phone with his dad and afterward relayed a hug and I'm proud of you relating to some positive life stuff going on right now. In my head I'm thinking
I didn't have a radical lifestyle change other than not drinking	it made my life worse	. . . I've kept a girlfriend, I haven't had to move homes or be evicted, I've kept a good job, I beat cancer, and now I'm pursuing custody of my daughter.  If I weren't sober, I don't think any of these things would've happened.  Knowing that I don't have to worry about the shit things I've done drunk haunting me, knowing I won't drink away my paycheck, knowing I won't disregard my health, and knowing I can be there for my child, has made it worth the effort.  If you're new, hang in there.  My initial sobriety wasn't triumphant,  <e1> I didn't have a radical lifestyle change other than not drinking </e1> , and  <e2> it made my life worse </e2>  for a while.  After 90 days it was hard to identify the point of not drinking, after the novelty wore off, again, but I stuck it out.  I'm really glad that I did, and I will continue to.  This sub helps, the community is amazing.  Take it one day at a time, invest in your hobbies, and reach out for help when you need it. I won't drink today with you guys. 
.	way?	. . . I feel like a cold might be coming on though and I haven't had one in at least a year and a half.  Are they correlated in any way?
I'm curious	I thought xanax was typically preferred	Am prescribed klonopin; never tried xanax.   My unresponsive friend uses klonopin more than xanax, and   <e1> I'm curious </e1>  why because   <e2> I thought xanax was typically preferred </e2> .   The short half-life of xanax seems useful to me, too.   TIA
she's gone	I feel like I have no motivation to get my work done	I know that this is standard and no one really wants to do school work but I mean I honestly can't do any of my work anymore.  I went through a weird break up and it was my first, we were only going out for a month but it was really fun to talk to her all the time and she really made me happy and motivated me a lot.  But now that  <e1> she's gone </e1>   <e2> I feel like I have no motivation to get my work done </e2> .  I have no friends to help motivate me and I just don't know how to say it to anyone.  Even as I'm typing this I really don't know what the problem is, I got an extension for a paper that was due on Tuesday and I still haven't even started it.  I just don't know what I'm doing anymore and I'm always so close to just falling apart and giving in.  
Said the last one was a lie	she didn't call me unlovable	Apparently she's known about it for over a year.  Seemed pretty fucking satisfied about it too.  Said if I'm gonna talk about our family to strangers on the internet make sure it's the truth.  No telling if she has read my messages or responses.   <e1> Said the last one was a lie </e1>  because  <e2> she didn't call me unlovable </e2> , just agreed with my dad that no man or woman would want to be with me.  It's been a rough night.  
Then	die.	Then I wouldn't have to feel guilty for wanting to die. 
I'm	here.	I'm not referring to suicide but maybe moving to another country.  I'm sure it's all crossed our minds sometime or another.  Starting somewhere new, a clean slate.  Maybe a warm place with no memory. . . What makes me sad is that I really doubt anyone would notice or even acknowledge me leaving home. . . I wonder if there is an afterlife and if so can you spy on people you knew after you've gone? I like to think that heaven and hell exist.  Trying not to get religious here. 
never gotten anything good that i like	the only good thing i like are the one essentially to my surivial	feels like my whole pathethic life is just some game play by someone and literally had no meaning, also only good luck seen by other which cause hatred toward me while not knowing the extreme bad luck.  mostly 2 to 1, but sometime 3/4 to 1.  had enough with it.   <e1> never gotten anything good that i like </e1>  as  <e2> the only good thing i like are the one essentially to my surivial </e2>  and never anything i enjoy.  gonna blow my brain open
I'm a burden on my parents and all but my one friend has abandoned me	my self-destructive tendencies	I have no ambitions or goals.  I've dropped out of college and am back to living with my parents.  My ex left two years ago and I still feel nothing but guilt and regret over her.  I've been excommunicated from her life.  I go over to my friend's house to smoke pot and forget how horrible I feel, even though it just sets me back and keeps me from being productive.  Not like I have anything to be productive with, anyway, considering how little I actually do these days.  I'm empty, bored and tired.   <e1> I'm a burden on my parents and all but my one friend has abandoned me </e1>  (probably because of  <e2> my self-destructive tendencies </e2> ).  I'm a bad person, and I'm ready to die.  If she can't forgive me, then I don't wanna live. 
everytime i am surrounded by strangers, people older than me, or guys	i get so nervous	i'm not one of those witty, sarcastic, hilarious people that talk non stop and make you clutch ur belly while laughing.  But i'm not humorless either.  However,  <e1> everytime i am surrounded by strangers, people older than me, or guys </e1> ,  <e2> i get so nervous </e2>  till the point it gets awkward if i want to say something, i lose my ability to say anything, even if it's not a joke.  How can i losen up ? i know all of those; get more confident advice.  That wouldnt help trust me.  lately ive been thinking of even taking a few shots of alcohol everytime i want to go out so im more chilled and relaxed.  Also one more thing, how can i stop beating myself up over that? im always blaming and bashing myself, if u have any advice please let me know
i havent taken it	it made me depressed	 <e1> i havent taken it </e1>  since i was little because  <e2> it made me depressed </e2> .  I feel good right now my leg is tapping a bit but im concerned i only took 10 mg
I	is.	I once od'd on Advil.  It was pretty peaceful.  No pain.  Just very sluggish and chilly.  I think I'll try that again when I know for sure that no one will walk in on me this time.  I'll have the bath ready this time.  I remember it being hard to work the knobs.  I'll have the cat's locked in the bedroom with their litter box so I don't have to worry about them getting out when the perametics arrive. I'll mix myself a nice drink and enjoy my last moments. I feel so peaceful when I plan my suicide.  I always wondered why that is. 
We	smoke.	We don't have any rules against smoking at work, and everywhere I go there is smoke! I feel guilty just being here 8 hours a day, besides the fact that smell is a constant reminder to smoke. 
Used	bottle.	Used to coming in and cracking open a bottle of wine 'just to have one glass and unwind'. . always ended up finishing the bottle.  
get extremely anxious when I don't like the ending of something	I just imagine the characters suffering eternally	I get really into a lot of fictional media (Books, tv shows, video games).  And I will get very anxious when I think something bad is going to happen to characters I like.  And  <e1> get extremely anxious when I don't like the ending of something </e1> , because  <e2> I just imagine the characters suffering eternally </e2> , and also imagine the happy ending I'll never get.  This happened very badly with the ending of Mass effect 3, in 2012 and now today with the ending of darkest dungeon.  Does this happen to anyone else?
I've had extra stress, a crappy diet and heartburn	that's three big triggers right there	Me again.  So my new fear is irregular rhythm or afib.  The past few days I've had more skipped beats palps than normal.    <e1> I've had extra stress, a crappy diet and heartburn </e1>  so   <e2> that's three big triggers right there </e2>  but I'm still afraid it's afib or something serious.  In all honesty half of my palps are probably gas or some shit that I'm blowing out of proportion.  I can't go to the doctor for another week or two unless I go to the ER which i don't think is necessary.  Same with therapy
I felt embarrassed and weird	bawling my eyes out in front of someone I met 2 minutes ago	I finally returned to school therapy counseling yesterday but I had a new therapist this time.   <e1> I felt embarrassed and weird </e1>   <e2> bawling my eyes out in front of someone I met 2 minutes ago </e2> .  
I	time?	I have this problem where, if I don't finish something (it can be anything) in one sitting, I'll likely never get back to it and finish it.  I paint and draw and it's mostly evident with my work, I have so many unfinished pieces. But I've found recently that I'm like this in other areas of my life, as well.  I devote a day to reading a book in one sitting, or if it's a long book two days.  If I don't do this, I'll forget about it or not bother to finish it.  I binge-watch tv shows as well, I can't watch a tv show one episode every week, I just can't.  It's like if I don't devote most if not all of my attention to a certain thing, it's out of my mind forever.  This is true for relationships too, if I'm not completely obsessed with my partner, I don't even care about them.  It's like it's all or nothing for me. Is this a part of black-and-white thinking, or is it just me? Do you have problems dividing your attention and find it hard to not get immersed in one obsession at a time?
I	burn?	I dont drink for social norms, for any other reasons really than the sensations it begets, the burn in the throat, the relaxing feeling. I need to cut down or better yet quit it, but I want to find a good replacement for the flavor experience. Do you guys know of any good non-alcoholic, non-soda things I can drink instead, to kinda simulate my need for the burn?
Which sucks	friendship and empathy can be so comforting yet it's so rare	Feeling down about the stigma associated with SZ/SZA.  I find it hard to make and keep friendships.  My SO has made great strides in understanding but I still feel a disconnect.  Does anyone else feel the same way? On meds I feel like I'm pretty square headed but society really just doesn't understand this disorder and I feel like it makes people afraid.   <e1> Which sucks </e1> , because  <e2> friendship and empathy can be so comforting yet it's so rare </e2>  
I	forward.	I want to be reversed, undone, unmade.  I want to disappear from every photo.  To slip from the minds of anyone who ever saw me or knew my name.  I want all memories of me to fade away, and for the sun to rise and set without anyone noticing anything's amiss.  I don't want to write a note or explain myself, I don't want a funeral, I don't want to be found.  I don't want to experience any more pain.  I don't want the aches and the tears, I don't want to fake anymore smiles or laughs.  I'm done with the good things, too.  I had things and people I loved but I'm just too tired and things like a warm sunny day, the happy little things like dogs and coffee and funny jokes just can't make me feel whole.  I can't be the person I wish I was, I can't be complete.  All there is this purgatory where I can't make me into something worthwhile, and I can't undo it all either.  There's no way forward.  
they couldn't be bothered doing anything	no matter what you did, the reality of not having a family who loved you was not going to change	In the year after finding out about the narcissistic dynamic of your family, did anyone else feel exhausted? And like  <e1> they couldn't be bothered doing anything </e1>  because  <e2> no matter what you did, the reality of not having a family who loved you was not going to change </e2> .  How did you get past this? I exercise, work, study, see  my therapist, spend time with my partner's family and my friends, read and have a healthy diet.  But I feel empty and like my world has been shattered.  
My	IMO	My suspected  displays a wide range of narcissistic behaviour, but also shows some behaviours that may not (on the surface), be consistent with narcissism. For example, I have heard them apologise and stop their offensive behaviour for a while.  Then they went back to doing it again.   But the fact they apologised in the first place seemed odd. They've admitted to having low self-esteem, despite acting arrogant.   IMO
My grandmother, mother, older sister, and uncle all have had schizophrenia at one point in their lives	Im just wondering in case maybe I should reach out to researchers looking to understand gene expression with this mental illness	 <e1> My grandmother, mother, older sister, and uncle all have had schizophrenia at one point in their lives </e1> .  How common is it to see schizophrenia run in families like this?  <e2> Im just wondering in case maybe I should reach out to researchers looking to understand gene expression with this mental illness </e2> ? Also I should add that I am seeing a psychiatrist and don't have schizophrenia.  I'm not afraid if I do develop it in the future.  (My family responds well to medication)
I'm still scared to talk about what I spoke to my psychiatrist	I'm worried she won't say anything about it	If my mom is able to take me tomorrow, then I'll talk to my therapist about what I talked about to my psychiatrist.  But  <e1> I'm still scared to talk about what I spoke to my psychiatrist </e1>  because  <e2> I'm worried she won't say anything about it </e2> .  Im still thinking the absolute worst case scenarios.  
people stick around longer than others	they feel too awkward to openly reject me	Sometimes it takes people longer than others to figure it out.  Sometimes  <e1> people stick around longer than others </e1>  because  <e2> they feel too awkward to openly reject me </e2> .  But eventually everyone realizes I'm not a person worth being around. 
I am just sad constantly	i dont have a proper job, dont have any friends and dont have any supportive family	  <e1> I am just sad constantly </e1>  because   <e2> i dont have a proper job, dont have any friends and dont have any supportive family </e2> .   The one job i have which is casual made a big deal about telling me how work had dried up and that there would be no more work for me then 24 hours later asked me to do a random shift.   Im sick of people taking me for granted.   In the past i have been the back up friend the back up family member and now the back up employee.   Im always the person who can be relied upon but no one ever cares how i feel.   I am so over it. 
I	mad	I can't imagine anything that would make me so mad
So	enough.	So I finally managed to get a DUI on Monday night.  I feel miserable and sorry for myself.  After so many years of drug and alcohol abuse something needs to change or I will kill myself and/or someone else.  The damage count alone to date is bad enough.  
18	though?	18 y. o.  guy here. Drowning in hate over my emotionally abusive stepdad. Drowning in frustration over my impervious mother.  Drowning in helplessness over relatives who can't be bothered.  I want a happy family.  I want a reason to love and be loved.  It'd take 7 more years before I can graduate, get a job, then move out.  I can't endure anymore. I've been contemplating suicide for weeks, but don't have the balls to do it.  Earlier just now friend told me a dude committed suicide by jumping from the 4th floor of a mall.  No high-rise buildings with rooftop access from where I live.  No bridges.  Mall? Hell yeah.  Almost painless, too. Why should I NOT kill myself though?
I'm just curious	I'm currently seeing someone but my anxiety has suddenly creeped up on me this year after several months being dormant and it's really bothering me	 <e1> I'm just curious </e1>  because  <e2> I'm currently seeing someone but my anxiety has suddenly creeped up on me this year after several months being dormant and it's really bothering me </e2> .  Just curious to see what others do. FYI: I don't recommend sharing with new dates that you have anxiety.  It really scares them off.  I like to manage my anxiety on my own.  Thanks!
I try to stray from	I just think about the past and all the mistakes I've made	I don't know how much I can tolerate these suicidal thoughts.  It's just constant.  I don't even know if I want to truly die, but all that goes on my head is just ending my life.  If  <e1> I try to stray from </e1>  that  <e2> I just think about the past and all the mistakes I've made </e2> .  I don't understand how someone would not go crazy with my brain.  I can't tolerate this anymore.  Can anyone help me please
By	good.	By no right, i mean that you have your health, life is generally good, you might even see how lucky you are in general. . .  And yet you're still feeling depressed when by everyone's account, you've got it pretty good. 
I don't feel stressed	I actually like these tasks	Triggers.  Seeing somebody on a walk tonight with his cigarette, a dreamy look on his face.  Completing study and homework for a deadline tomorrow.  And a bunch of other triggers.   <e1> I don't feel stressed </e1>  and  <e2> I actually like these tasks </e2> , but I feel like I want a cigarette.  It's coming and going all evening.  I never had such an intense quit as this one.  Not quite a month in and I still want one.  I don't actually want one when I think about it but that craving feeling is crazy strong sometimes.  It is much better than the beginning, just frustrated this still happens and makes it hard to concentrate on tasks at hand.  It'll get better.  My brain is healing itself with each trigger overcome.  Breathe.  Water.  Snack.  Whew.  Thanks for listening to my sharing and the support.  
i	shunned	i struggle and sometimes manage to make things awkward with greetings, goodbye's and etiquette in general.  i avoid eye contact, misread social cues, anticipate wrongly.  i guess loneliness plays a part with rejection sensitivity, rejecting others before they can do so to me.  being used to and expecting to be outcast and shunned
I (29/F) need some serious advice	My boyfriend (30/M) of less than a year had already been diagnosed as depressed at least 10yrs before we met.  His mother has been battling cancer for as long as I've known him.  We recently received a call saying her health had taken a turn for the worse.  Flash forward, she's barely hanging onto life and it's not likely she'll make it through the rest of the today.  He's currently with his mother (out of state) and I'm not sure how to support him once he comes home	 <e1> I (29/F) need some serious advice </e1> .   <e2> My boyfriend (30/M) of less than a year had already been diagnosed as depressed at least 10yrs before we met.

How do I help? How do I support someone who is already suffering from depression with something this difficult?
Day	????	Day 7 and I have nothing to do. . . .  I'm still down with the sickness with a cold on top of it AND I have my period. . . . .  WHAT SHOULD I DO ????
hard	.	hard to explain! weirdly, i'm a basically socially regular person with friends and shit, but a lot of the time lately i'm very depressed/anxious and don't want to talk to my friends about it and feel very lonely.  specifically, lonely for male attentions.  i miss my ex and need a distraction.  not a sexual kind, which is mostly what there is on omegle and is just even more depressing.  people on omegle are pretty weird.  there's nowhere for me to find someone to relate to who's like basically regular like me but also incredibly depressed like me.  anyone like that here. . . . ???? but not like a teenager cause i'm 28. . . . . 
I'm	human.	I'm laying here thinking that no matter what scenario I put myself in, I won't be happy.  I don't have a purpose. .  a calling.  No matter where I live, who I'm dating, who my friends are, I'll never been satisfied.  Everything is so dark.  The only thing keeping me alive right now is my dog.  I'm wishing I could have the life she has.  She's a happy dog.  I want to be a happy dog.  Not a depressed human.  
.	grand?	. . . the people who make me suicidal are the very same people that prevent me from killing myself.  I love them, and I know they would kill themselves if I were to do it first.  But they make me want to kill myself.  Ain't life grand?
I	hrs	I do this wayy too often and i never learn from my lesson, this is so messed up. I didnt even try studying for long and then I eventually got distracted and have been on the internet for far too many hrs 
I can't make jokes on the fly most of the time	I have this weird disconnect from reality in general	I'm not even mad about it, but it does suck that much more joy out of life.  I just can't laugh for the life of me.  I can find something funny, but most of the time it almost feels like I have to take a few seconds to really try to see the humor in something, to really understand the context of the situation, the play on words, connotations, ect.  Basically I have to try way to hard to get humor when it's thrown at me.  That said,  <e1> I can't make jokes on the fly most of the time </e1>  because  <e2> I have this weird disconnect from reality in general </e2> .   Even if something's funny, I can't really laugh, it feels forced.  Sound like you guys? Is this a symptom of my depression or something more?Also: I tend to be outside of reality in general most of the time.  I think this is just a heavy introversion, where I can't be in constant focus of the world around me, but idk.  Been tryna meditate to fix this. 
There's no escape from my depression	I've been sleeping as much as possible but it's not enough	Another lonely college student all alone for spring break.  Haven't talked to anyone in close to a week.  It rains constantly, literally every second of the day.   <e1> There's no escape from my depression </e1> .   <e2> I've been sleeping as much as possible but it's not enough </e2> .  At least when I used to have suicidal thoughts they would provide some relief, as a solution.  But now I don't even have that.  If anyone found out I'm suicidal again I would get kicked out of school and have to move back across the country, where I'd be even more alone.  There's no solutions in life.  I'm done with all this think-positive bullshit.  There is nothing I can do. 
I'm	tho	I'm starting to wonder if these low moods, negative thoughts and sucidal ideation are just for seeking attention even though I dont feel comfortable talking about it to other people? I really want to end it tho
I	great	I was just thinking about this.  You start out by feeling sad for no reason, thinking my life is great
I also have very bad anxiety	I'm just looking for advice	I can be very random and childish and I'm worried that sometimes it may be too much.  I'm afraid that I might scare people away that I care about.   <e1> I also have very bad anxiety </e1>  and this might not be as big a deal as I'm making it but  <e2> I'm just looking for advice </e2>  to maybe control myself a little better. 
Without weed	I feel depressed and awkward	Now is the first time I can admit that its there.   <e1> Without weed </e1>   <e2> I feel depressed and awkward </e2> .  Ive hid it for months and am tired of sneaking around to do more harm to myself.  Being fuzzy and paranoid for a one-time kick is not worth it.  I miss the person i used to be.  I'm better than what this is making me and I'm going to put a fucking pitchfork in it.  Wish me luck.  
her SO took a pretty liberal sip of her Mother Energy Drink	She stares daggers at him until he says	If this is not an appropriate post, I apologise.  When it happened, I thought of this sub and you lovely people. My best friend has a nmum for the books.  There's a specific word I'd use to describe her, but it's not well received in other parts of the world.  Thankfully, she is VLC. I was in the car with her and her SO.  She wasn't in a good mood to begin with and it was only made worse when  <e1> her SO took a pretty liberal sip of her Mother Energy Drink </e1>  (an Australian/NZ beverage).   <e2> She stares daggers at him until he says </e2> , That's the best Mother you've ever had. It's quiet for a beat and I'm like oh god pls no it's too early for world war iii but then she starts to laugh.  Like cry-laughing.  It's accompanied with a this ugly-but-amazing cackle that sounds like choking witch. When she calms down a bit she sighs and she tells him
it	Vegas throat sears like soy meat. It is a slow spontaneous combustion	(If you are way down low - like me -  you probably should not read this. . . )Day 52.  Used to think I was living the norm. After a few days of calm, yet another storm. I am stuck in hurricane season, only it couldn't be drier outside, and lonely. On the one hand, I am very proud of myself for getting this far.  Never been this way out of the green cloud, I feel like a star.  After many false starts, I did it, changed my lane. I feel like I broke the chains off of old mary jane. But the thrill of it is dampened by all of the rain. Fatigue, random body heat not unlike a fever. The reflux that had me up at night stole my viva. I dreamed I had caught the ebola from a little girl.  I gotta get off this continent and let my mind unfurl. The heat alone is threatening to destroy me. Because of  <e1> it </e1> ,  <e2> Vegas throat sears like soy meat. It is a slow spontaneous combustion </e2> 
I	gets?	I am only takeing a very low dose and wonder if I need a higher one I still feel anxious 70-80 % of the time.  Is this normal it has helped in that I'm crying less ( and have felt happier at times) but not lowered the amount of anxiety I'm feeling is this as good as it gets?
Submerge	ymmv	Submerge your face in a bowl of cold water and hold your breath for a few seconds (should only take a few seconds but don't go longer than 10-15s at a time, lack of oxygen just fuels the panicky fire).  This triggers the mammalian diving reflex which forces your heart to slow, and your parasympathetic nervous system (the brakes so to speak) to kick in.  While ymmv
Ive been clean from opiates for a little over a month, some days it's really hard but I made it this far	I'm just going to keep going	So  <e1> Ive been clean from opiates for a little over a month, some days it's really hard but I made it this far </e1>  so  <e2> I'm just going to keep going </e2> .  But I just feel like my life isnt as good now, I feel lost and empty and I just feel like my life was way better and more productive on opiates maybe thats not true maybe it is, I don't know why I'm posting just trying to get these thoughts off me but damn sometimes I just reminisce on the days I used.  I just want to be happy I want to be motivated and just content with my life and it feels like im only content on opiates, how much longer until I start feeling those things naturally? I used about 4 years, and 2 1/2 of those years was everyday use.  Sometimes I feel like dying would be easier but I'm not suicidal it just seems like life is too hard sober 
I was impulsive moved on my own and spent my 10,000$  savings	I don't have enough for rent	 <e1> I was impulsive moved on my own and spent my 10,000$  savings </e1> .  Now I needed a plane ticket back to my country and now  <e2> I don't have enough for rent </e2> 
Schizophrenia affects 1% of the total population	That means there must be numerous celebrities with schizophrenia	 <e1> Schizophrenia affects 1% of the total population </e1> .   <e2> That means there must be numerous celebrities with schizophrenia </e2> , but no one is out and open about their schizophrenia.  All the lists on the internet shows celebrities that are way past dead.  It would be amazing if a few or even a single well known celebrity would come out with schizophrenia and even better if they talked openly about their disease. 
So,	Anyway.	So, uh, gonna save all the bullshit.  I'm just an angsty teen in a pretty standard life.  Just feeling lonely tonight.  I know my problems are kinda BS.  I've lived with depression before, it's not that.  I'm just very lonely &amp; I just kinda want to die.  I don't want pity &amp; I don't particularly want help.  I've helped people in this sub before on my normal account. I just feel like life isn't my cup of tea, and I get miserable fairly often.  I think in a bit I'll drive my car into a bridge I picked out a while back.  Figured I'd just leave behind one last post or something? Idk.  Anyway. 
I smoked	being depressed and not having enough to live for	I've quit smoking 142 days ago now, and I smoked between my 18th and 25th birthday.  Part of the reason  <e1> I smoked </e1>  was just  <e2> being depressed and not having enough to live for </e2> .  During the past years, this has changed dramatically and I'm optimistic about the future and want to make the most of my life. However, I'm so worried about the health effects I've caused by my stupid habit. .  I want to live until I'm at least 80, have kids and a beautiful wife but I feel like I'm a ticking time bomb that will get cancer before I turn 50.  This severely fucks with my sense of self-worth, how can I justify to get someone to fall in love with me while I ruined my body for so many years? It just feels like such an unfair thing to do.  How do I cope with these thoughts? 
You	truly.	You know the reassurance that no one else even notices the thing you fixate on? Nope.  I get feedback on things I didn't even know existed to be noticed and it can really trigger the anxiety flaring up. Example: seating in the choir.  h.  It's never negative, but at 27 I'm the youngest by 15 years and less than half the average age and a woman sitting with the men (low voice) makes me conspicuous.  (The average age of the congregation is similar. ) People have asked (genuine curiosity) why I sat say, three people in from the end rather than four.  I wasn't even aware I had a 'usual spot'.  This is a social anxiety nightmare (a friendly one, though).  Proof that people are always watching and forming opinions about everything.  Welcome, panic over social interactions.  It's been too long, truly. 
Can	.	Can I show up on a hospital and ask to get help if I deal with suicidal thoughts or depressioN? Im not really informed and I dont want to look bad. .  
I'm somewhat calm but I feel myself building up like a time bomb	I feel like I'm gonna do some bad shit and hurt someone real bad soon	On Friday. . . I don't know whats happening to me.  I'm blocking it out as best I can.  Got served an eviction notice today. I don't cry.   <e1> I'm somewhat calm but I feel myself building up like a time bomb </e1> .   <e2> I feel like I'm gonna do some bad shit and hurt someone real bad soon </e2> .  I lost it on my landlord today. I can't sleep.  The last two nights I've been really shaky.  My insides have been shaking.  I don't know if theres something wrong with me or if I'm having a physiological response even though I'm blocking it all out. I've been suicidal myself before.  I don't know what he was thinking.  He was so happy that day I saw him before he did it.  I don't know what snapped in him and I don't want it to happen to me. He didn't leave a note or anything. He hung himself in my aunts fucking closet. 
grateful	this	grateful today that i am doing everything i can to protect my body.  during my drinking days being unwell came with the added burden of guilt at my negligent and self-destructive attitude towards my health.  being unwell reminds me that my body is capable of great pain and sickness, and should be treated with respect.  glad i am finally doing this 
Had a friends gathering where i spent about 5 hours	i came back my mood turned bad and felt very low	 <e1> Had a friends gathering where i spent about 5 hours </e1>  but after  <e2> i came back my mood turned bad and felt very low </e2>  . 
And	myself	And I know that mom would not be sad if I killed myself 
That would suck even more	they would force me to live in an even worse state	I'm just afraid I'll break my neck and get a concussion instead of dying.   <e1> That would suck even more </e1>  because  <e2> they would force me to live in an even worse state </e2> .  I'm also looking for ways of hanging myself, I have a lanyard and some wires that I could tie to a ceiling fan.  That might be better.  
Been	this.	Been sober since Thanksgiving 2016.  Sorry, no exact day since it happened when I was sick and delirious.  Sorry for the long text, just had to put this somewhere. It's interesting how I found this joint at such a crappy time in my life. Then again, I'm trying to be positive about being laid off, which I somewhat have been.  Maybe the sobriety has helped bc when it happened, I didn't overreact.   Rather, I was somewhat logically processing what happened.  I found the joint yesterday in my bookshelf, cozily tucked.  I didn't want to smoke it yesterday, but today I felt like it was calling to me. Sunny, uneventful days in a quiet house with no roommates - my ideal smoking day. I ripped it apart and inhaled the familiar smell.  The smell was like an old friend. I flushed the flower down the toilet and tossed the wrappings.  It felt cathartic, peaceful and difficult.  I feel happy I didn't do anything to have guilt weigh me down and ruin my progress.  It's a bittersweet feeling.  But I prefer this. 
That	is!	That personality disorders have subtypes or that the individual in question might be a psychopath or a sadist who happens to have a personality disorder?Spent half an hour browsing through posts of self aware Ns and when, or from whom, to expect narcissistic rage as opposed to the usual fear of being exposed and subequently humiliated (narcisstic injury).  I would love to hear your opinion on what malignant narcissism is!
I	panic	I feel horrible and I keep obsessively thinking (look at last tweet) I spoke to a friend about it and they said that it's my anxiety talking but then I started to doubt that.  It's a vicious cycle.  I hate it.  I feel disgusting.  I feel like I'm going to panic 
I	Help!	I don't want to slip.  How do you stop being a white knuckle ex-pot head? I hate to sound desperate but I've made the decision to quit completely and now it's all I can think about.  Help! 
I feel suicidal a lot of the time	disappointment in myself	I recently started university but anxiety and depression are keeping me home.  I rarely leave my bed and don't get hungry.   <e1> I feel suicidal a lot of the time </e1> , mostly from  <e2> disappointment in myself </e2> .  My life is falling apart and i hate the looks of sadness and disappointed questions from my parents.  If i felt safe to drive, i would park and sleep at university so I'm there in the mornings.  Though I'd still miss lectures.  I'm such a failure.  
i can see her get nervous	i tell her the small amount that i have	i go to the on campus therapy center, and they are all student workers there.  my therapist has asked about suicide a few times, and i have been. . .  mostly honest with her about it.  just that those thoughts are like background noise, and constant.  that its like a backup plan.  i didn't tell her that i have seriously contemplated it recently at one of my low periods or that i definitely have the means, but  <e1> i can see her get nervous </e1>  when  <e2> i tell her the small amount that i have </e2> .  I am not super worried about myself, but I absolutely do not want to get institutionalized.  it would be nice to be able to talk frankly about the subject, but so far i have held back because of the possible repercussions.  What can i say before she has the grounds to do anything?
I'm	.	I'm floored.  What is this forgiveness? I thought from being on here that the first step was accepting that they will never change and abandoning all hope that things could have been or will be different.  I don't know what to think. . and then she went on about how I have to pray to God in a certain way for my prayers to be answered.  I prayed to God so much in my youth, and yet I still suffered physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.  I'm a religious person, and I can't imagine that somehow I just didn't get the formula right.  Where do you go when you and your therapist have different ideas about the cause of your problems? I know I have problems-but I don't think forgiveness is the solution. . 
it's a whole lot harder for me	it isn't necessarily as negative	Hello guys, I've been a lurker in this sub since I started nofap and pornfree a while ago, It's a struggle dealing with those two but with gaming  <e1> it's a whole lot harder for me </e1>  since  <e2> it isn't necessarily as negative </e2> . I've said it again and again I can stop gaming anytime I want but now I'm feeling all lonely and sad
I don't try harder to achieve my life goals	somewhere deep down inside I'm sure that I'm going to end up killing myself	The meme said I'll admit it.  The reason  <e1> I don't try harder to achieve my life goals </e1>  is because  <e2> somewhere deep down inside I'm sure that I'm going to end up killing myself </e2> . It suddenly hit me that this is how I've felt for a long time.  I'm a 23 year old graduate and I remember thinking when I was 15 that I would wait until my parents passed away to kill myself. I don't think I ever healed from whatever made me feel that way and I've been having suicidal thoughts again. 
I have a pretty mild Depression	everything just seems grey and sad to me	I still remember the time when I was younger.  Everything was so bright and colorful.  But since  <e1> I have a pretty mild Depression </e1>   <e2> everything just seems grey and sad to me </e2> . . .  
I decided to taper	I think that now I'm really unmotivated, bored and apathetic towards everything, I suppose	I'm now weaning off Lexapro.  Previously was on 20mg Lexapro, by slowly tapering, now I'm on 10mg.   <e1> I decided to taper </e1>  because  <e2> I think that now I'm really unmotivated, bored and apathetic towards everything, I suppose </e2> .  I just try to read books, watch films, go out with friends but during this moments I just feel Well
I	.	I can't, man. . .  I can't. . . Dealing with this feeling everyday. . .  I can't. . . I feel like my energy and my spirit has been drained completelyI'm just. . . I can't. . . 
Just	support.	Just can't wait for 1111. I'm so fucking proud of myself for making it this far.  It's really pushed me to my limits and I'm starting to realize my potential in a lot of things. Stick with it y'all. For me, telling anyone and everyone who would listen about my quitting, my cravings, and how many days I had under my belt kept me accountable and helped me reach out for support. 
I have the feeling that reality can be reduced down to a sentence or thing/substance/idea/concept but that sentence isn't there	there is nothing	Hi I hope anyone can relate to this.  I am diagnosed as UHR(ultra high risk) for psychosis, and I am pretty sure I meet all the criteria for ADHD-PI but have not been diagnosed for that.  It seems like I can't 'grasp' my senses.  All my senses seem to be hollow but at the same time everything obviously exists.  It feels as if there is a gap between my thoughts and reality what makes it feel like nothing is really there at all.  It sucks. . . I really hope anyone can relate. Another related problem is my thinking.   <e1> I have the feeling that reality can be reduced down to a sentence or thing/substance/idea/concept but that sentence isn't there </e1>  so  <e2> there is nothing </e2> .  This sounds strange, I know, but it has to do with feeling.  Thank you 
My mother has always tried to make me and my atheist brother feel guilty	trying to say oh why is god punishing me	Hey everyone, Has anyone ever had a parent use religion to try and excuse their narcissistic tendencies? Well let me tell you all about my mother.  Quick background about me: I was raised in a Muslim household.  I'm not too religious; I have a non Muslim boyfriend that my mother does not approve of, my brother is an atheist, and my other brother is just chillin.  My chill brother, let's call him Harry, plays a lot of games on his computer with his friend (let's call him Mark).   <e1> My mother has always tried to make me and my atheist brother feel guilty </e1>  by  <e2> trying to say oh why is god punishing me </e2> 
It's	Then	It's finally happening.  Nmom is letting whatever guard she had around my sisters down and they are finally getting to see who she really is.  It's to the point that GC and SG make up bullshit cover stories to feed Nmom before her family time call on Sundays.  Then
Talking	else???	Talking makes me breathless and lightheaded, if I continue to talk I get super anxious and more lightheaded, and starting to come close to passing out completely.  It happens at the gym too, heart palpitations and dizziness.  I've had blood work, ekg, 2 week heart monitor, 30 day heart monitor, stress echocardiogram, and ekg.  I've had spirometry for asthma which was normal but dr thinks I still have some mild asthma allergy induced.  I feel like I'm dying, or that the heart dr is missing a blockage somewhere, or something.  My hands and feet are always tingling.  I'm going insane and can't do this anymore, I love my job and I can barely hold it together and carry on conversations without almost blacking out.  Help, anyone else???
I	was.	I had been using the memories recorded by my scattered brain to piece together just how deep I got.  Over time I could not retain just how severe my addiction got.  Scanning through photos there was a face which I did not recognise.  It seemed like a machination of pure emptiness.  Nothing else has shocked me as deeply as the realisation that this harrowing creature was me.  It instantly reminded me of just how bad I was.     
my body quits long before my mind	it's not super helpful	Most of the time I'm not anxious about any thing but more of a constant spinning inside my head.  The best way to describe it is like when you're looking at a ceiling fan.  If you blink quick you get a glimpse of each blade but it's impossible to follow any one blade unless you turn the fan off.  That's how my head feels.  Like I can't get a grip on any one thing to try and fix it but it's a whole gdamn swirl of bullshit.  And 9 times out of ten it just pisses me off.  I've tried the breathing exercises, and they work, but in a it's not my problem don't mess with it kinda way more than a slowing the fan down kinda way.  The only solution I've found is working out but  <e1> my body quits long before my mind </e1>  so  <e2> it's not super helpful </e2> . 
I hate about depression	it sneaks up on you when you're finally in a good spot	What  <e1> I hate about depression </e1>  is how  <e2> it sneaks up on you when you're finally in a good spot </e2> .  I've been taking my medication, taking my art seriously, and trying go outside more.  It's been alright, until tonight.  At some point during my trip to the laundromat, I felt that familiar sinking feeling.  That everything around me was moving slow.  That I was being forced into autopilot.  My mouth is set in a straight humorless line.  My eyes look sleepy.  I'm not talking to anybody.  When I came home, I threw my bag in the corner and frowned at how my side of the bed was covered with shit while my mom laid on her side of the bed watching tv.  I wanted someone, anyone to reach out but at the same time I'd just say I'm fine.  It's like I only want the RIGHT person to talk to me. I have no one currently like that.  Definitely not my grandma
Does	time.	Does anyone just want to disappear and it be like you never existed? How do you cope with this? I'm not suicidal, but I feel helpless and hopeless and scared and just plain tired.  I feel like my life is precariously balanced on a point and it could tip at any time.  Normally I can talk myself out of mental spirals like this, but not this time.  
She was one of the only people I cared about and she's gone now	I feel like I'm slowly burning bridges with everyone I know so that eventually no one would care that I'm gone	My mom killed herself at the beginning of the year.  It was her third attempt.  Even before she tried the first time I hated my life and could never seem to understand how to be happy and I still don't know how.   <e1> She was one of the only people I cared about and she's gone now </e1> .   <e2> I feel like I'm slowly burning bridges with everyone I know so that eventually no one would care that I'm gone </e2> . 
I was able to actually think for a moment and instead choose to go to the basement and take it out on the punching bag.  Then I took a few deep breaths and write in my journal about what happened	it's a big step forward for me	Yesterday, I got really frustrated about something inconsequential (something about housework, I think) and my first reaction was to punch the floor and throw something across the room.  However,  <e1> I was able to actually think for a moment and instead choose to go to the basement and take it out on the punching bag.  Then I took a few deep breaths and write in my journal about what happened </e1> .  It seems small, but  <e2> it's a big step forward for me </e2> !
My husband is frustrated	he keeps coming out and trying to get me to come back to bed if I'm on the couch with the TV on	Hi everyone,I'm getting really frustrated with my sleep habits.  My insomnia is very cyclical, but on bad nights I might sleep 2-3 hours at a time, stay awake for 1-2 hours, fall asleep again and then eventually wake up to my alarm at 6am.  This waking and falling back asleep may happen several times in a night. Thing is, I cannot fall back asleep just lying in my bed.  I have to get up, go to the couch, and put on the TV, and the noise will lull me back to sleep.  This will not happen with music or ambient sounds (like ocean sounds).  It HAS to be the TV.   <e1> My husband is frustrated </e1>  because  <e2> he keeps coming out and trying to get me to come back to bed if I'm on the couch with the TV on </e2> .  I want to be able to stay in bed all night, but without fail at least half the week I sleep on the couch.  Anyone else experience this? What can I do? Every doctor I see basically tells me Yeah
I just needed to say something, to experience some kind of human interaction	I feel so isolated and detached and lonely and I sometimes wonder if I'm even alive at all	 <e1> I just needed to say something, to experience some kind of human interaction </e1> ( <e2> I feel so isolated and detached and lonely and I sometimes wonder if I'm even alive at all </e2> )Thank you for your time
I feel ashamed and weak and out of control	i want help	 <e1> I feel ashamed and weak and out of control </e1>  and like  <e2> i want help </e2>  but I don't want to listen.  God fucking kill me that would be cool.  I'm almost 20 and life is good but i still feel debilitated sometimes. 
Sober	beer.	Sober since Sunday, and even though these are baby steps, I feel like a new guy.   Little worried about the weekend, but also excited to see what I can do / experience w/o all the beer. 
i'm	drinking.	i'm 24 and struggling.  i was a very heavy binge drinker - 4 nights a week would see me easily down 7 pints, cans and whatever else i drank during the blackout (too much, especially for a skinny lady).    i'd drink alone, but i mostly drank with others.  like many on sd, i got sick of the crippling hangovers, shame, anxiety physical/health decline and stagnating personal development.  however, i'm really feeling the hole left by alcohol in my social life (my friends are all heavy drinkers and i don't feel able to hang out again really yet).  my depression is also getting quite bad.  anyone else? i would love to hear your experiences and how you have dealt with this.  edit: context - currently unemployed but starting a new job in a couple of weeks.  just moved back to my home town, where i have a handful of old friends left.  i was starting to get to know some new people (friends of my old friends) but this stopped when i quit drinking.   
I actually catch myself making sure that I hadn't texted something to someone the other night that I might not remember	I might be ashamed of in the morning	Like  <e1> I actually catch myself making sure that I hadn't texted something to someone the other night that I might not remember </e1> .  Something  <e2> I might be ashamed of in the morning </e2> .  And I guess it takes time to adjust to understanding that I just couldn't and wouldn't do anything like that now.  Weird.  But I'm sure I'll get through.  Thank you SD and I will not drink with you today.  
Things	Drink	Things I Won't Do:- Go to bars or lounges where others are drinking.   Not yet. - Eat any foods prepared with booze, such as wine sauces or certain whiskey-flavoured BBQ sauces. - Obsess about drinking. - Tolerate boredom.  It's the worst. - Pine for the days spent drunk and out of it. - Hate myself.   This one's pretty hard still, but it's getting better. - Forget the toll booze took on my ability to think clearly. - Forget how booze affected my work performance. - Forget spending five minutes puking.  Every.  Single.  Morning. - Drink
My skin has actually gotten redder and bumpier	I quit drinking	So, has anyone else experienced this?   <e1> My skin has actually gotten redder and bumpier </e1>  after  <e2> I quit drinking </e2> .   Just curious if anyone has any insights to share. Still happier not drinking and can spend the money I save on skincare if need be 
too much	I haven't been working on that in awhile	I've tried doing therapy for ptsd.  It was terrible and I always left the office in a hypervigilant state, unaware of my surroundings.  My ptsd has ruined all my past relationships, and now I'm married, and it is making my relationship with my husband difficult as well.  More often than not, when we have disagreements, i look at my side of things and realize that it stems from some part of the abuse.  Whether it's money, sex, communication, it boils down to my inability to thrive.  The best way I've found to try to deal with the ptsd has been in beginning to write a memoir about it, but then that became  <e1> too much </e1>  even, so  <e2> I haven't been working on that in awhile </e2> .  There's so much that's triggering, even now.  My husband is usually pretty great about this stuff, but it's not his fault, and he shouldn't have to deal with my inability to live a normal life.  Especially when I can't manage our money soundly.  I just can't keep this up anymore; I get triggered by so much, and therapy is just out of the question.  How do I keep from letting ptsd take over my life? 
I've	rant	I've been trying to produce music for about 5 years now and I still suck compared to other people who have done it for a year or two.  Tried to learn piano awhile ago but quit after a couple lessons, tried to study theory but it makes no fucking sense to me, trying to learn the technicalities of mixing and mastering and even though I can make certain things sound ok I still have no idea what the fuck I'm doing to try to use it in different situations.  Music is all I really care about in life and it's just not fun anymore when everything I make is subpar.  I'm not progressing at a pace that would even make it worth it in the end anyway.  Fuck man, I can't even care enough about the things I enjoy to actually get good at them.  Wish I wasn't so lazy, but I've always been and can't really see myself changing.  I don't really want to be here anymore.  rant
Had	thoughts?	Had a decent night out last night with my colleagues, some senior people there too. . . overall it was fine, i was talkative and my social anxiety at no point was crippling.  But looking back i'm almost more worried about my actions that I did take, whether I made a fool of myself, whether I made it too awkward and dwelling on moments of awkwardness even though overall it was a good evening. . . how to deal with such negative thoughts? 
I am super nervous	I could barely get through high school with my ADHD	I am starting my first day of college next week, I do take medication, but  <e1> I am super nervous </e1>  cause  <e2> I could barely get through high school with my ADHD </e2> .  Any tips for homework? Lectures? And just getting through in general? 
I	time.	I just got home from a week away with my boyfriend.  I was at his on Sunday which was mothers day here.  I was just asked 'How was your mother's day, with your mother' clearly insinuating that I would rather spend time with my boyfriends mother than her.  When I left my boyfriend's home his mother hugged me and told me the door was open anytime.  My mother may think she's being smart, with her spiteful digs but it's only proving me right every time.  
To use the word 'dad' is a joke really	during my childhood he must have managed about 10 whole sentences in my direction	I am late 40's and after years of 'taking it' I finally broke and unleashed my anger over the phone to Ndad.   <e1> To use the word 'dad' is a joke really </e1>  as  <e2> during my childhood he must have managed about 10 whole sentences in my direction </e2> .   After such great parenting I moved out at 18 and after Nmum died and he retired from work I was stupid enough to get back in with him, I slowly realized that he was using his 'golden years' to mock and emotionally abuse me.  Nothing I did was any good, my job was wrong etc etc etc etc.  I really went for it over the phone and think hopefully that he is afraid of me as he never calls now.  However this happened about 6 months  ago and I am still really annoyed at him and only wish the worst on him and hope he suffers etc. Can anyone who has gone through months of rage give me any suggestions on how to deal with it? I am currently vlc but still annoyed!
That's study is no longer accepting any patients	I asked about this study	I spoke to the assistant to one of the principal investigators last week regarding a different study that they're conducting.   <e1> That's study is no longer accepting any patients </e1>  so  <e2> I asked about this study </e2> .  I was told that the phase 3 trials, which they were planning to start sometime over the summer, now look to be starting nearer to the end of this year. If this is something that interests you,  maps. org, signup to receive information regarding their studies where is says Stay Connected.  All updates for the study will be sent through MAPS. I so want to feel good about this but I'm afraid I wont get selected.  I want to share this with everyone here so if I don't get selected at least I know that maybe someone here did who otherwise wouldn't have known and they may get relief.  That would help me deal with things. 
I	profession.	I noticed over time when reading posts in raisedbynarcissists, that it seems a lot of people have named the Narcs they know as teachers.   It got me curious how many of my fellow raisedbynarcissists were raised by or have teachers who are narcissists in there family!  My Nmom was a high school teacher by profession.  
I'm	series	I'm an addict but I've been paring down the number of games I play.  I no longer play shooters, rougelikes, or RPGs regurally and have reached the point that I feel like I can control the urge. However, I'm still fully addicted to grand strategy and management games. I go through cycles of playing one or the other, with the primary fames being sports management (Football Fanager and OOTP), tycoon (old capitalism series
Basically,	why.	Basically, today I finally realized that I've been suppressing my memories of my oldest friends, from, like, elementary school.  I don't know why I'm doing it, but I am, and I didn't even realize until a dream I had right before waking, they were in it, and just the fact that I dreamt about them startled me enough to wake me.  Then I thought back and realized I quickly change the subject when my parents ask about them and I basically never talk about them.  It seems like I've simply repressed them, and, I don't know why. 
I've been posting somewhat regularly on a few forums in search of friendship	I'm just dodging a confrontation with my true desires	 <e1> I've been posting somewhat regularly on a few forums in search of friendship </e1> , but I know  <e2> I'm just dodging a confrontation with my true desires </e2> .  The truth is, despite being Agoraphobic, I'm a romantic, a people-person.  I derive more positive energy from making someone feel happy or good than any other possible source.  I know now that my heart is telling me it is longing to find the other half of what will make me feel whole. But how? How do I find love in this situation? Is it even possible?I could lead off a singles ad with saying I'm a nice guy who loves people and thrives on making others happy.  But that would just be a paper-thin cover temporarily disguising my true headline, which would probably be something like, 33 year-old single guy who hasn't seen anything outside his house in 4 years looking for love. . . lives with parents on a steady $ 1
As	me.	As a disclaimer, I'm not a psychologist, and I haven't deployed, but I'm a soldier who cares about her brothers and sisters in arms who might need someone to talk to other than a doctor who may or may not have served.  If you want to joke around about all the times you embraced the suck, go ahead.  If you need to put painful experiences into writing to organize your thoughts, please do.  If you'd like to call and chat, I'd be happy to do that. Sometimes all we need is a friend to talk about what we want to, and not only what pains us, to find peace.  If that sounds like something that might help, please feel free to PM me. 
Anyone	days.	Anyone knows the reason why entire day starting from morning until late afternoon is almost a messy feeling, even though how hard you try to calm mind and tell that everything is okay, it's just anxiety telling you things are dream like.  Night times are like so calm, no thoughts, you can watch tv, play games, maybe interact with people and so on.  This happens sometimes on random, sometimes in loop of days.  
Something	Thanks.	Something is clicking and I feel really calm and positive about my ability to refrain from alcohol.   That is even in the face of a planned all inclusive vacation in Mexico in about 10 days.   I have a supportive wife, and a wonderful support system right here!  Thanks. 
Just	PORN.	Just a friendly PSA to NOT DO IT.  Not even a peek.  You're not missing much.  I was so close to blowing my hard earned streak.  I ended up masturbating to my girlfriend instead.  So another friendly reminder: if you're gonna jack off, fine.  JUST DONT DO IT TO PORN.  
When my social anxiety kicks in is I suck at making meaningful friendships	I think I am cool at a acquaintance status but that I am annoying if I pursue more intimacy	Meeting new people is generally easy as hell for me as long as there are friends that I can use as a social bridge.  I generally can't go alone though.  I am clearly an extrovert I get depressed after not going out or meeting with friends.    <e1>  When my social anxiety kicks in is I suck at making meaningful friendships </e1>  because  <e2> I think I am cool at a acquaintance status but that I am annoying if I pursue more intimacy </e2> .

Every day I've been struggling	I just feel weak, incapable, pathetic, a walking joke, and shame for feeling all of this inadequacy	Right?  <e1> Every day I've been struggling </e1> .  It's been years.  What's the point? On top of all of this  <e2> I just feel weak, incapable, pathetic, a walking joke, and shame for feeling all of this inadequacy </e2> .  I'm a tool.  If I try and defend myself and feel better, I'm just angry and drive you away.  
Is	.	Is is probably infamous for psychiatric meds. . .  Do you not feel sad nor happy? Not easily entertained? I can't find things as funny as they are nowadays.  I feel really strange that's hard to explain.  It got me out of feeling really depressed.  But I feel nothing. . .  
So,	affects?	So, I made myself go to a practice.  They're really into hollistic therapy, so that's cool.  I eat wheat germ in oatmeal and mix half a banana with a cup of milk before bed and I've actually been getting about six hours of sleep.  Today I picked up my Seroquil script.  This is the first time I've been prescribed only one medication, and I'm glad they aren't bombarding me with combos like most places do.  I've never taken this before.  My first dose is tonight.  What are the most common side affects I need to look out for (other than weight gain)? Anything I should avoid? I smoke marijuana regularly, will that cause any negative affects? 
today has been my one week smoke free	I'm very happy and feeling much better	So  <e1> today has been my one week smoke free </e1>  and  <e2> I'm very happy and feeling much better </e2> .  However, later in the day yesterday and today my mouth has had a very salty taste that I can't seem to get rid of.  It's almost maddening.  I drink plenty of water and brush my teeth and the like.  Is it just a symptom of quitting? 
Im	now	Im so fucking tired of going around not having anyone to talk to.  being the ice person all the time.  I don't know why but im just starting to feel very pissed of.  I've had social anxiety since a kid but just now im starting to get really angry with the fact that i have to live with this.  Im tired of hearing i just gotta live with it the rest of my life.  Im tired of taking antidepressants that doesn't even work.  What the hell even does antidepressants do? ive never heard of anyone that took antidepressants and said they worked.  Im feeling so fucking trapped.  I want to have friends to have fun with and shit.  Why do i have to live with this?? it makes me so angry.  I just want to stop having social anxiety right now
Don't	fuck.	Don't know what's in store for me and anxious as fuck. 
Just	around	Just yesterday a box of old files showed up at my door.   I have no idea who sent them or how they found me, but they are obviously old files from my parents' house that we sold back in 2012 (the house has since been torn down and a new postmodern monstrosity is rising in its place, but that's life).   I was diagnosed with ADHD back in third grade and started on meds for it, which made a huge difference.  But now at almost 40, and as a pediatrician, I have a new look at my childhood.   It's illuminating.    *Grades: I remember getting a lot of flak about my grades, but even before I turned around
He and I are both very afraid of becoming our parents	We both feel that we would make the same mistakes our parents did	My partner and I were both born to narcissistic parents.  We both have FLEAs, and we both share a neglectful and abusive past.   <e1> He and I are both very afraid of becoming our parents </e1> .   <e2> We both feel that we would make the same mistakes our parents did </e2> .   Are there any parents on this sub who could tell us if we should not have kids?  We would love to hear from anyone who could provide their experiences.  Thank you so much for any advice you can give.  We greatly appreciate it! 
Every	addiction.	Every second still seems like an hour.  I'm on edge, there's moments when I'm like wow, I'm a non smoker this isn't so bad, I can do this, then in the next thought I'm in a manic panic that I want to smoke so bad, but I can't give up.  I enjoy all your post guys.  Let's beat this addiction. 
Really	btw.	Really started getting into pinball last year.  I used to play poolbilliards a ton, but got bored with it.   In pinball, I had found: *Something with immediate rewards, over and over again *Something where I could always see my skill improve each time *A social or solo activity, depending on how I felt that day *Every single table is different, they're all puzzles to figure out! *Something I could hyperfocus on for hours, but be out of the house while doing it *A cheap hobby *It has a competitive aspect (tournaments) Anyone else find themselves gravitating to pinball? Or do you have another game of choice? I'm in Seattle btw. 
I	weeks?	I have tried and failed at quitting several times now.  I am disgusted by my smoking habit.  I have a bad smokers cough, constantly reek of cigs.  its time to stop.  those of you that have quit.  what helped you get through the first couple of weeks?
Some of my friends are suicidal	the pressure they put on me is getting to the point where I can't take it anymore	 <e1> Some of my friends are suicidal </e1>  and  <e2> the pressure they put on me is getting to the point where I can't take it anymore </e2> .  One of them is a lying manipulator that has done self harm in the past.  She has tricked me in the past but, if I decided not to be her friend anymore I know for a fact she'd either kill herself or go back to self harm.  My other friend is luckily getting help and is not so much of a problem.  And while she can still put some pressure on me, I probably do it more to her.  Back to the other girl, I need help deciding what to do.  I feel that I might do something I might regret if I she doesn't get the help she needs.  And while I tell her she needs it, she's in denial about it.  And probably the biggest problem about this is that I'm not 100% sure that it's real and I'mean worried she'said doing it for attention.  Please, just help me!
I am worried that I may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder	a few notable symptomsissues that I experience	Hi all,  I've never really posted about my life or my story, please bear with me.  I was 'raised' by a terribly narcissistic mother, who abandoned me when I was an infant, as well as tried to kidnap me multiple times.  I also had a cruddy dad, who popped pills and was absent most of my childhood.  Essentially, I was verbally and occasionally physically abused by my mother, stepmother, and stepfather.  My question is: is it possible for me to have PTSD from this lifetimechildhood of experiences? I do not have one singular traumatic experience that triggers me.   <e1> I am worried that I may have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder </e1>  due to  <e2> a few notable symptomsissues that I experience </e2> .  (I also have one notable traumatic experience involving an accident my father was in, he got hit by a bus when I was seventeen and almost died, which I do have nightmares and flashbacks of, but that is a different story. ) Does anyone have any idea if this is possible to have the disorder due to a multitude of experiences? Thank you for any advice, help, or information in advance.  It is greatly appreciated. 
That's	sickness.	That's a question I constantly ask myself.  A couple months ago I started working at a job that I adore, that I love.  For once I felt really, truly happy.  In my blissful state I thought maybe, just for a second, that I could really overcome my depression.  That was ignorant.  Now, I can't look at myself, I don't feel hungry, I'm crying every chance I get.  I'm filled with anger right now; I honestly have no clue why.  I guess I'm angry at myself.  I argue with myself, even cry to make them stop.  I don't know how to fix this anymore.  I am so fucking exhausted.  I'm tired of fighting myself, I'm tired of feeling like a worthless, good for nothing, piece of shit.  I'm tired of being angry, of being sad and of being numb.  I'm tired of fighting.  I.  Am.  Tired.  I just want to go away.  I just want to not feel this way, to not BE this way but I know I will never escape this sickness. 
I'm going to see a doctor about this	I just can't anymore	I know I have anxiety, and it really is tough.  It feels like I can't even live my own life anymore without some fearworryintrusive thought.  I truly wouldn't wish this upon anyone, because I can't stop overreacting to stupid small situations.  And it's everything.  I'm getting sick and tired of it and so is everyone else around me.  I'm 19M and  <e1> I'm going to see a doctor about this </e1>  because  <e2> I just can't anymore </e2> .  I can't deal with these thoughts.  All day and all night long.  I can't even fucking sleep.  Then I have anxiety about getting anxiety about certain situations.  I don't want it to have an affect on me and my gf's relationship, my family or my work productivity.  Does anyone else experience this?
so	post	so im really anxious about seeing my doctor about my anxiety next week and just wanted to know what i can expect to happen roughly ( (I know that sounded stupid)And i also wanted some tips for staying motivated and calm  apologizes in advance for this poor structured post
I choose to talk about how mass media portaits social workers	I study social work	I live in Italy, and I did 3 years of university, and after those years we student had to write a thesis.   <e1> I choose to talk about how mass media portaits social workers </e1> , since  <e2> I study social work </e2> .  One month ago I graduated and sent my thesis.  Then I was done with university! Now the professor that followed my thesis sent me an email, asking me if I want to talk about my work to a group of other students, during a seminary.  God, I really don't know, I'm too anxious to do this.  I don't know what to reply to my professor.  If I don't reply, or if I say no, maybe I'll be seen as rude.  I'm a bit scared and wasnt expecting this!
I keep seeing people wishing they had someone to hold or feeling awful	they haven't been in a relationship or whatever	 <e1> I keep seeing people wishing they had someone to hold or feeling awful </e1>  because  <e2> they haven't been in a relationship or whatever </e2> .  It doesn't help.  They aren't going to fix you like you might hope.  I was in a strong relationship when my depression and anxiety finally overtook my life.  The desire to maintain the relationship slowly started to diminish.  She was above anything I could expect in terms of supportiveness and while I appreciated it me not being present or available just made me guilty in the back of my mind.  Sort of a dull guilt if that makes any sense.  She endured and was willing to endure but it was taking its toll.  We kept having these 'meaningful' conversations couples tend to have when something is bothering the other and I'd apologize and she'd be understanding and nothing would change and we'd go through it again and again.  Despite all this she was patient and willing to stick things out hoping and maybe convincing herself that she knew I would eventually get better.  I didn't really share that hope as I wasn't thinking past the next week.  I could see the negative effect everything was having on her
You	more?	You start working on a project and you ask yourself, what make this meaningful.  You start brainstorming and start connecting the ideas together.  Then you create something really beautiful.  Are we doing the same in life.  Are we connecting meanings of the world to formulate a model of reality.  Do we ask ourselves, what makes this meaningful.  And then we take a pen and a notebook and start writing names of elements and try to connect them together.  Can we elevate our common sense and hear the calling of our reason to observe new ideas we never thought of before.  Have you ever thought of the significance of what the act of Reading does to your brain.  How it nourishes your intellect and guides you toward a higher level of knowledge.  Are you curious about discovering more?
It's	sleepy.	It's day 2 and I'm sitting in my office.  I'm trying not to think about happy hour.  The strangest thing is happening.  For the first time I am feeling sleepy even though I got 7 hours of sleep last night.  Does anyone have a similar experience?  Is this normal?  I've gone 3 days before but never felt this tired and sleepy. 
Hi	interested!	Hi friends! I wanted to see how many of you were interested in checking in with each other on a more regular cadence - something like a buddy system? I've been using kratom for the past 3ish years.  I've been tapering down to very low doses (&lt;2gday) and find my withdrawal symptoms are entirely psychological.  I see a ton of support for those going through serious physical and PAWS withdrawal and that's fantastic! I've been there before and I know how comforting it can be to have this subreddit.   I don't really have anyone to check in with on a more regular cadence.  It would be great to have someone to just exchange notes with everyday.  Let me know if you're interested!

I am really desperate to quit	8 years of smoking	As the title says, I am always prolonging quitting but it has been on my mind a lot lately.   <e1> I am really desperate to quit </e1>  after  <e2> 8 years of smoking </e2>  but I can't seem to take the final step.   Any tips on getting past the excuses and actually going for it? I have set my quit date to April 5th.   Also not really interested in using substitutes at all, after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way.   Any tips are welcome though, and congrats to everyone here who has stopped or is trying to stop!!!
I	Cheers	I feel as though I were the shore, And you the waining tide,Breaching 'to my stony arms,Receding, then to hide,Ever looming, sorrowful moon,Pulling you further from me,Yet here I wait, until dawn's break,And the loving embrace of the sea.  Never really been one for poetry, it just came to me a second ago and I wanted to post it somewhere I guess.  Feedback would be great if anyone is up for? Cheers
I had to fix a drink	to calm the F down	I get an anxiety attack even when I know a conversation could trigger me.  It is frustrating. . . I do the self talk. . . I know what is real. . . . do breathing. . . etc. . .   <e1> I had to fix a drink </e1>   <e2> to calm the F down </e2> . . . 
I wanted to just put holes in the walls	it was pissing me off so much	I think I'm going to end my life some time this week.  I just can't take the pain anymore.  Last night was one of the worst nights I've had in awhile.  Nothing but bad thoughts while I laid in bed.  Took me almost 3 hours to fall asleep.   <e1> I wanted to just put holes in the walls </e1>  because  <e2> it was pissing me off so much </e2> .  I can't fucking do it anymore.   I'm too weak.  I know I need to tell my parents I need help, that's the advice I get from people, but I just fucking can't.  I can't stop feeling embarrassedashamed of being depressed and having social anxiety.  I know I shouldn't care.  But how the hell do I stop caring?  I can't do it.  What's the point in living the same day any longer? (I wake up, go on Reddit, eat, YouTubeReddit, eat, video games, sleep.  Every day.  For the past year. )
Tonight I recommended Breaking Bad to one of my closest friends.  They told me they had seen the pilot and weren't motivated enough to keep watching	I got extremely angry	 <e1> Tonight I recommended Breaking Bad to one of my closest friends.  They told me they had seen the pilot and weren't motivated enough to keep watching </e1> .   <e2> I got extremely angry </e2>  and told them that I would end the friendship and bring them social isolation and harm if they didn't watch the show.  Took a step back and cooled off.   My therapist tells me that I interpret rejections of things I like and my recommendations as rejections of ME, and then a fear of abandonment takes over and then I'm enraged.  Does anyone else experience this?
I knew why I wasn't crying	I never feel happy or sad anymore	Last week my girlfriend and I were watching Bridge to Terebithia.   I remember reading this book when I was in like 2nd grade and it ruined me, I sobbed so much.   When I watched the movie when it came out it was even worse, I was such an emotional kid when it came to stuff like that, don't even get me started on Where the Red Fern Grows.   But there I was, a freshman in college, watching this movie that meant so much to me.   When Leslie dies in the movie my girlfriend started sobbing, like a regular person.   But I really didn't feel anything at all.   When my girlfriend noticed that I wasn't crying she was just pretty confused I guess.    <e1> I knew why I wasn't crying </e1> , it's because  <e2> I never feel happy or sad anymore </e2> .   Just numb.   Depression really fucks you over like that I guess.   To be honest with you guys, I really wanted to sit there and cry with her, I wanted to feel sad or at least feel something. 
Just	exercising?	Just curious if anyone else's narcs lose their little minds when you do something healthy and normal for yourself.  My one narc is really disturbed to see me taking care of my skin.  The other loves to sabotage healthy eating.  Isn't this an *interesting* pathology? To get that worked up over someone flossing, taking a nap, or exercising? 
I've been so wrapped up in my own shit (nothing compared to what he's gone through of course) that I've completely neglected his needs	I'm so ashamed, but more importantly I just want to help him	We've been in a relationship for almost 7 years and he's been battling with depression for almost 4 of those years.   <e1> I've been so wrapped up in my own shit (nothing compared to what he's gone through of course) that I've completely neglected his needs </e1> .  I'm absolutely devastated that I've let this go on for so long,  <e2> I'm so ashamed, but more importantly I just want to help him </e2> .  I want to be there for him, but I have been so out of touch that anything I do seems phoney.  He's angry, disappointed and exhausted - and rightly so.  I've never experienced depression myself (obviously), and I am unsure how to reach out to him and provide him the support that he needs.   Does anyone have any advice that they're willing to share with me?

Not exactly sure what I want to spend my time doing, or what goal I am working towards, I only know that I need to spend it doing something productive, while minimizing the vices and addictions in my life.   Even if that is venting on Reddit. 
And I can't make friends	my severe anxiety	I'm in group therapy at the moment and I can't even look people in the eyes properly most of the time.  Every time I go, the therapists who run the group always talk about 'connection' and spending time with friendsfamilypeople you love.  Apparently it's a huge part of recovery.  But I have no one.  No friends.  Unsupportive parents that always put me down.  <e1>  And I can't make friends </e1>  because of  <e2> my severe anxiety </e2> .  Every time I mess up in a social situation, it'll haunt me for months and trigger suicidal thoughts.  For context, I live in the UK and am getting mental health treatment off the NHS.  This therapy group only deals with low mooddepression, none of the other issues I have.

It's like I don't register where I am and what happens to me, like I'm permanently on auto pilot.  I'll forget what I did this morning and the time is just FLYING by.  I have no sense of time- this year could've been a month to me and wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  I have no sense of self and I'm just drifting through life, barely able to remember what happens. 
A	normal?	A friend of mine has quit cold turkey from drinking.  He was drinking about 1. 5-2 bottles of smirnoff vodka a day.   He is now on the third day of recovery and these are his symptoms (I'm staying with him until he's better) He's very weak, I don't think he can walk unaided He's having auditory hallucinations, like full conversations with himself (even when asleep), though as far as i know nothing else like visual or touch stimuli.   He can't eat He's taking shallow breaths, I wouldn't say rapid - maybe one every 1-2 seconds.   He's been twitching since he's come off- not like seizures or anything but it looks similar to hiccups He's basically been asleep solidly for the whole time.   I've noticed that the first day he was hallucinating slightly but able to walk, although slightly uncoordinated. Day 2 he was hallucinating a lot and found it difficult to walk.  Day 3 he's hallucinating less but is unable to walk unaided and is slightly more uncoordinated.   Is this all relatively normal?

Hey	appreciated.	Hey all,On day 5 at the moment and psychologically not super great.  Trying to get out of the house for something other than work and get out of my head a bit.  While I'm home though, I have the typical jumping out of my skin anxiety problem.  Anyone had any success using vitamins or supplements to help this jumpy feeling? It makes me feel like I can't leave the house at all.  I also don't just want to replace one crutch with another.  I have an appt with a doctor for some prescribed anti-depressantsanti-anxiety meds but it's another few weeks out.   Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hey	getting?	Hey I quit not very long ago.  I keep reaching into my pockets and when my smokes and lighter aren't there I suddenly feel this sense of dread.  It's almost like wanting to call your best friend and realising they just died (sounds dramatic but that's how intense the feeling is).  I also am getting all kinds of pain and my digestive system feels like I swallowed a bunch of forks and knives that are slowly trailing through my intestines scraping everything on the way through.  I also keep feeling very confused about what's going on and what I'm doing.  It's like I keep forgetting what I'm doing right in the middle of doing it and can't snap out of it.  Does anyone have any advice on what to do with the digestive pain, the strange deep feelings of dread and the severe mental confusion I keep getting?
I just cry every time i see a pic of me when i was small	I keep thinking my life was so much easier before	I dont know if its part of the healing but I have been so extremely sad since I found i have a narcissist mother and an enabling father.   <e1> I just cry every time i see a pic of me when i was small </e1> .   <e2> I keep thinking my life was so much easier before </e2> .  Yes I had a weird mother but I managed it.  Now I just feel so sad. . .  For what I had to endure when i was an innocent child.  Which to be honest I cannot even remember but Im sure was there.  I cannot even take my son to a toy store and look at playmovils for example which I loved when I was small and not cry.  I just see myself as a kid playing with them so innocent, and not knowing what was going on.  I feel so sad for myself, for what I lost, and i have this hatred towards my mother that I just cant deal with it.  Will this pass? 
those are all things that will never happen to me	I've had to block random LGBT people on Facebook when I see them doing things like graduating college, getting married, having a good life etc	I'm ugly as fuck, have no talents, no skills, fail at everything I try, have a supposedly awful personality, social anxiety, tons of mental illnesses.  And I'm just jealous of everyone.

Especially with good-looking gay men; they get such a good quality of life that uggos like me could never even dream of.  I can't deal with talented people either.  That makes me so upset.  I was never good at anything.   Fuck I just wanna cry now.  
What	not?	What are some of the affects you guys experience when on caffiene ( with no meds)? Is it effective at calming u down or not?
If	it.	If I have a lot of reason to believe that a certain person in my life is the source of my DR is it okay for me to cut this person out of my life? Being around them gives me anxiety beyond belief, and I encounter them several times a day.  I love this person but it's hard justifying a relationship when I just get DPDR from it.

I	.	I haven't been on here in awhile but I'm feeling really beat down right now.  I have this cycle of going a couple of days without alcohol then inevitably SO brings something home or I get really stressed out and drink.  And drink, and drink.  I eat way to much when I drink and have picked up the horrible habit of making myself throw up so I can eat and drink more.  That is a secret I've been keeping from SO.  I feel is drifting apart and we don't even hang out together when we drink.  He games and I deal with the kids.  I've been sick lately but that hasn't stopped me.  I'm on depression and anxiety meds that I know are not working because of the drinking.  I just don't know how to break this cycle.  I'm all gung-ho for a few days then just crash.  Sorry this is long and jumbled.  Just needed to get this out.  Frustrated and losing hope. . . 
All	PleaseMakeItStop	All I want is for the pain to stop.  That's it.  That's all I want.  I'll do anything to make it stop.  Literally anything.  All I can feel right now is hurting and it won't go away.   This is pretty much all I've ever posted on my account.  Read my post history and hate me.  Be disgusted by me.  I'm just so sick and tired.  I can't even think of what to write.  I'm in so much goddamn pain right now that I don't even know what to do or say.  The words aren't coming out right.  Nothing is working out.   PleaseMakeItStop
so	crazy?	so basically I have to know what is going on 100% of the time, if my girlfriend goes to the store and says she will check with me that she got the right things before she pays and doesn't, then it makes me shaky and itchy, and like I have heartburn and like I need to cough but can't.   It happens with everything when I don't know what is happening 247, if someone is a minute late I start frantically texting them trying to find out what's going on.  If someone says they want to do something with me tomorrow and then change their mind a few hours prior it feels like my whole world is crashing around me.   It isn't fair on the girlfriend and she finds it overwhelming which just makes it happen to me even more so I dunno what to do.  Is this a form of anxiety or am I crazy?
Isn't	point	Isn't it curious that it's perfectly fine for them to yell this at you, when you have concerns about a decision they've made that will affect you? But the moment you say it to them about a decision you've made for yourself, they get angry and make you feel guilty for standing up for yourself? Oh and another golden one, I couldn't care less about what THEY think when you mention others who back up your different opinion.  But when they want to make a point
I was thinking about just giving the therapist a previous post where I explained my symptom history	I doubt that I will be able to remember it all	I have a 3-hour psych-evaluation tomorrow and I was thinking about bringing evidence like tutor invoices, a picture of my room, printouts of text messages, etc but I fear like I might come off as defensive or pushy if I bring documentation.  Also,  <e1> I was thinking about just giving the therapist a previous post where I explained my symptom history </e1>  because  <e2> I doubt that I will be able to remember it all </e2> .  Is that going to come off as scripted? Also, I am a little nervous so I was just wondering what I can expect from a 3-hour long evaluation.  Another thing that I am kind of concerned with is that while I feel that symptoms that I have are in all likelihood indicative of ADHD, I am afraid that I may overperform on their tests because I am a Computer Science student so I have basically been drilling problem-solving and identification tasks for years (e. g.  design an algorithm for this problem, find the bug in this code sample) even though I probably have the same struggles as anyone else with ADHD.  Do you think that my concerns are warranted?
my depression	I am so fucking sad every day, things affect me so much, and deep inside I strongly believe depression can not be cured, my brain is already fucked up, and the rest of my life will be miserable	I feel like  <e1> my depression </e1>  was meant to happen.  Like it would have happened sooner or later.   <e2> I am so fucking sad every day, things affect me so much, and deep inside I strongly believe depression can not be cured, my brain is already fucked up, and the rest of my life will be miserable </e2> .  I have nothing going for me.  I am a hardly average looking 20 y. o with no skills at all, just some intelligence which is only useful to realize how shitty this world is.  I feel like saying goodbye to the happy 10 year old I once was.  
I can't wear several items in my wardrobe without feeling terrible	they're saturated with phrases like that looks terrible on you	Someone posted earlier about covert narcissism.  I dealt with aggressive criticism from both parents and from my last relationship.  9 months out and I am under an avalanche of realizations.  I have to qualify most of what I say.  I have to make it clear that I am aware my opinion is not the only one, I am willing to change my opinion, and I am absolutely open to hearing alternatives.  When I go shopping, I automatically reject many items.   Upon leaving the store I realize I had been shopping through his eyes, and didn't buy things that I thought he'd make fun of me for.  This includes food.  And thoughts.   <e1> I can't wear several items in my wardrobe without feeling terrible </e1>  because  <e2> they're saturated with phrases like that looks terrible on you </e2> 
Just	burden.	Just finished reading The Easy Way and smoked the final cigarette.  Off to work and excited to not have to worry about annoying customers with the smell of cigarettes.  Pack and a half a day for 18 years.  Feels good just thinking about breaking free from that burden. 
the programming field has changed entirely	a degree from 2015 is worthless; not to mention the programming language i've used throughout my life, java, has become almost entirely obsolete with positions requiring C++ or Python	24 yrs old, graduated college w a bachelor's in comp sci in december 2015; no work or job offers since, applying to positions nearly every day, not a single word back, roughly $ 20,000 in debt  <e1> the programming field has changed entirely </e1>   where  <e2> a degree from 2015 is worthless; not to mention the programming language i've used throughout my life, java, has become almost entirely obsolete with positions requiring C++ or Python </e2>  ; I spent 4 years and $ 20,000 to get a shit degree that takes me nowhere parents are getting impatient and i'm close to getting kicked out, i've already started cutting and i'm tempted to kill myself entirely lmfao
Sometimes	anymore.	Sometimes I wish to be somebody else.  Someone who is not depressed.  Someone who is motivated, genuinely happy, and satisfied with their life.  I haven't felt like that since childhood.  I'm tired of being me.  Today as I walked to my car I just wanted to sink into the floor, or keep walking and never stop.  I don't know what to do anymore. 
i could never kill myself	the damage it would do to my family	i just got back from going to disney world, the happiest place on earth.  didnt smile one fucking time.  thought maybe going would bring back the child like wonder and innocence that i fucking yearn for.  but no, still that empty fucking husk of nothingness consumed my body, every ounce of negativity wiggling deeper and deeper into my subconscious.  im to young to feel like there is no point to life.  every year i get more jaded and cynical.  im only 15 fucking years old, how will i be when im 20 or 30? i feel like this shit is never gonna get any better.   <e1> i could never kill myself </e1>  because of  <e2> the damage it would do to my family </e2> , but that doesn't mean i dont think about from time to time. 
I	to.	I dont know how anxiety work for other people but when I'm busy I dont notice it that much, but when I'm alone and theres nothing left to distract me it becomes crippling and sometime I just start almost crying and hyperventilating.   I'm afraid to talk to someone about it but I know I need to. 
I don't want to burden them with my problems	they deal with my autistic man-child brother	Everyone I ever love ends up leaving.  Even now, I can't believe my husband loves me and I doubt I love him.  Feeling like I'm drowning in the dark.   Not suicidal.  My life is too important right now.  Just really lonely and uncomfortably unsatisfied with existence.  Friends don't text, I'm done reaching out.  Parents don't understand and  <e1> I don't want to burden them with my problems </e1>   because  <e2> they deal with my autistic man-child brother </e2>  .  He's a handful.  I'm just a bother.  Always have been brought up to believe self reliance is key.  Don't ask for help.  Be stronger than you think and carry what you can of everyone else's burdens.  Can't ever shake the martyr complex.  Can't stand being disliked or misunderstood.  I'm so suppressed emotionally that it comes out in violent outbursts, and then I get called dramatic
I don't even want to go to a therapist	I don't want to be stopped	I often feel like I am watching my own life.  I am so depressed on one hand that <e1>  I don't even want to go to a therapist </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want to be stopped </e2> .  On the other hand I can step outside myself and see how fucked up that is.  
I don't know how to small talk, start conversations, carry conversations	I never developed those skills due to my un-diagnosed ADHD in my HS years	So I recently got diagnosed with ADHD this year and was prescribed with Adderall 60 mg.  The results have been amazing, I actually am able to focus and finish tasks to completion and I have motivation that I lacked before.  Most importantly I feel more open to socializing and talking to people.  My problem though is  that I lack social skills like peers my age have (I'm 23).   <e1>  I don't know how to small talk, start conversations, carry conversations </e1>  because  <e2> I never developed those skills due to my un-diagnosed ADHD in my HS years </e2> .  Anyone else in a similar position? What helped you catch up on your social skills?
It has been about 16 hours since my last drink now	I feel extreme anxiety and rapid heartbeat	Background: 25 yo male - fairly skinny. I have been drinking a bottle of hard liquor (usually whiskey) everyday for about two weeks now.  Bottles range from 700 ml to 1l.  Should I taper down or quit cold turkey?  <e1> It has been about 16 hours since my last drink now </e1>   and  <e2> I feel extreme anxiety and rapid heartbeat </e2>  .  Also I am so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.  Help is appreciated!
I	.	I made the worst mistake of my life when I told my therapist about my serious suicidal intentions.  I've wanted to die for a while now, and finally when I think o have the courage to finally do it I tell someone and get placed on suicide watch.  I don't even have a belt anymore.  What was I thinking. . 
They	this?	They were close about 4-5 years ago, he used to deny that he liked her but said she was attractive.  Today he tells me he liked her but it was a long time ago.  Shes a tiny cute asian girl and im an average brownskinned girl.  I feel like i can compete with her and at point he was sexually attracted to her but im not like her, in attitude or anything (from what i hear).  I know im being unreasonable but im mad at him and nothing he says can change the past.  I feel threatened and rejected.  How do you guys get through this?
I	help.	I have been a steady oxycodone 10mg user for the last 4 years.  I have not had a day where there wasn't at least 30 mg in my system within a 24 hour period.  The average was probably 60-80 mg a day.   I lost my meds yesterday.  I take then for pain and yea, it turned into something a bit more sinester.  And I'm afraid.  I think I'm having wd since it's been about 36 hours and it's horrible ke and I just do t know what to do or even if I want to do it.  I have people I can call and get some time of analog like morphine but do I even want to do that? It's expensive as hell and maybe this losing my script happened for a reason.  I just don't know what to do reddit.  Please help.  
my brother makes fun of me	my parents have an obsession with threatening to hit me and hitting me	i have hypothyroidism, it gets in the middle of my school work. it makes me very lazy. i take propanol and it calms my heart down. but it doesn't help me stop being lazy. so my parents like to threaten to physically abuse me every single time I have a missing assignment,today I had 1 assignment I didn't do. my mom threatened that she doesn't care that my blood will be on her hands, and at least I'm dead. also my dad beat the shit out of me not long ago.  <e1> my brother makes fun of me </e1>  because  <e2> my parents have an obsession with threatening to hit me and hitting me </e2> . he also likes to make fun of my hypothyroidism because he thinks im overacting when I get hospitalized. I don't seem to have a purpose anymore
the weekdays are much easier to deal with	there's always work to be done	Being almost two weeks sober now,  <e1> the weekdays are much easier to deal with </e1>   since  <e2> there's always work to be done </e2>  .   The weekend however. . . is a bigger beast to tackle with.   Even with the most packed schedule during the day I can feel my will slipping at night and the urge to smoke comes back stronger than ever.   What do the rest of you do to fight this feeling? I know I shouldn't think of myself as weak, but damn my weekends seem empty without the high at night.   
But since I rejected to offer	I couldn't possibly pass the drug test, I have been drinking alcohol every day	I stopped smoking a little over a month ago.  First two weeks were good.  I was working out, losing weight and quit smoking (cigarettes).  I think I was more motivated to pass the drug test for new job.   <e1> But since I rejected to offer </e1>  because  <e2> I couldn't possibly pass the drug test, I have been drinking alcohol every day </e2> .  I am more afraid of becoming an alcoholic than stoner.  If I could quit smoking cigarettes, why am I drinking every day? I know it is bad for me.  Every morning I wake up, I tell myself, Okay
Right now things are especially bad	she's going through a divorce, having financial problems and hates her shitty job	My best friend (32f) has pretty severe anxiety disorder and also bipolar disorder.   <e1> Right now things are especially bad </e1>  because  <e2> she's going through a divorce, having financial problems and hates her shitty job </e2> .  She says she feels like she's going to lose it.  I'm really really worried about but don't know what I can do to help.  Any advice?
2016 was a pretty ok year	I didn't have any particularly massive anxiety attacks	I'd really thought they'd ended,  <e1> 2016 was a pretty ok year </e1>   where  <e2> I didn't have any particularly massive anxiety attacks </e2>  .  When I was worried sick about having diabetes a blood test could just calm that down by forcing me to face reality.  This new one isn't so simple, I usually don't follow the news or politics in any way shape or form, I always have held the opinion that the news simply profits off people's fear and that you should never really concern yourself with politics unless it directly effects your life.  But recently I've been hearing a lot of people talking about Syria and stuff and I did the wrong thing and looked it up.  Of course there were people fearmongering about world war and stuff and it was just so scary to read, and now I'm breaking out in a cold sweat, sick to my stomach, unable to sleep or concentrate on anything.  I know deep down inside that this probably won't amount to anything but the idea is so terrifying and now my brain is defaulting back to suicide as a solution for everything, it's awful.  This is why I never leave the world of escapism. 
Dear	N.	Dear Reddit, In my wave of despiration i made a reddit account today. . Im lonely and have severe depression i would like to have someone to talk to and not feel this dark feeling and thoughts cross my mind yet another lonely weekend.  Well to best hopes, N. 
I'm a bit apprehensive mostly	I'm worried if she can't take care of herself,  how will she ever manage to care for a puppy	As the title says, my live in girlfriend who is diagnosed with depression thinks getting a dog will help her.   <e1> I'm a bit apprehensive mostly </e1>  because  <e2> I'm worried if she can't take care of herself,  how will she ever manage to care for a puppy </e2> .   What do you think? Is it a good idea to get the dog or not?
I just feel like I have to confront the person and get angry	the recent or past bad thing that the person did	Sometimes when a person did bad, I just can't show anger.  I show it later after it happened.   <e1> I just feel like I have to confront the person and get angry </e1>  because of  <e2> the recent or past bad thing that the person did </e2> .  You may be curious why on raisedbynarcissist.  Well, guess why.  It's the bitch parent.  Is this passive-aggression? Shit if it is then it's bad.  Thanks! Edit: It's not the Nparent that caused my anger.  It's my brother. 
I think I want to get a sponsor and work the steps	the folks in the MA meetings with years of sobriety really seem to be experiencing life in an authentic way	I've been lurking on this sub for over a year now and am finally able to say I'm just shy of one month clean and sober from all substances.  I can't say I feel very good yet or particularly better but I do know that whatever I'm feeling, it's better than being stoned 247.  Does anyone have experience with Marijuana Anonymous meetings? I'm in the San Francisco area and have been going to quite a few different MA meetings (in addition to AA and NA).  I've dabbled in 12-step meetings in the past when I've tried sobriety but I've found the MA meetings particularly helpful since I feel like I can really relate to what people in the groups have to say about their marijuana addiction.    <e1> I think I want to get a sponsor and work the steps </e1>  because  <e2> the folks in the MA meetings with years of sobriety really seem to be experiencing life in an authentic way </e2> .  Curious to hear others experiences on this sub! Stay strong - and smart! We've got this!
I'm	matter.	I'm basically the scum of the earth.  I have bipolar disorder and while I was in a grandiose state for a few months I cheated on my boyfriend of 2 years twice.  I started leveling out and I saw the mess that I made of my life and I tried to kill myself on December 14th 2016.  My boyfriend has forgiven me but I'm constantly enamored with guilt.  I've made strides towards normal life but I hate it.  I hate working 9 hours a day in a grocery store.  I don't want to go back to college and work my whole life.  I don't find much pleasure in anything, and I'm uninterested in things I used to love.  My boyfriend is my only light, but we got into an argument and now he won't speak to me.  I just don't want to deal with life anymore, even if it makes my family sad when I'm gone.  I'm not going to exist so it won't matter. 
As	so!	As in, how do I approach him about it? Should I even mention anything? It doesn't bother me if he does, I just want him to know that and feel he can talk to me about it.  Thing is, it might not be OCD at all.  I've noticed recently that whenever he sees an ambulancepolice carhears sirens, he subtly touches his face, then foot and then says something quietly under his breath.  It's only when there's an emergency services vehicle around or when he hears sirens.  There might be other stuff that I haven't noticed, but either way.  Should I mention anything? If yes, how should I approach it? I want to understand it better so he doesn't feel embarrassed or anything but I don't know how to start doing so!
She's going to notice all of this and it's probably going to tamper her image of me	I seem really social at work but it takes me so long to get comfortable around people	She's into me too now but if I do ever gain the courage to finally ask her out I'm going to be so anxious and awkward on the first date and she's going to notice that and not like that.  Even if it does work out she's going to realize how socially inferior I actually am when she asks me to hang out with her friends or go to parties with her and I'm either so nervous that I'm visibly shaking and not saying anything or just saying really dumb shit and either way I'll come across as really awkward.   <e1> She's going to notice all of this and it's probably going to tamper her image of me </e1>  because  <e2> I seem really social at work but it takes me so long to get comfortable around people </e2> .  She's social, beautiful, funny, great to talk to, but god damn could she get a much better guy than me
If I should just go to other subreddit, please link me there	I do not know that much about this	I really do not know what other subreddit could help me with this question, If you know link me to it(I do not use reddit all that much).  It is really hard for me to explain.  I have this for few years now, and It is really hard to cope with this.  Basically I keep thinking about people that I hate and feel disgusted to, and when I do something, even basic tasks, chores, or even putting book in my backpack while thinking about people I hate or, as I mentioned, find disgusting, people will see me as them, andor feel same hate or disgust towards me, it really drives me insane and I don't know what to do, I, myself, know this is bullshit, but as a days go by it just gets harder, I do not want to open up about this with people who surround me, I just want to know what's wrong with me.  Mind you that my grandmother has schizophrenia.   <e1> If I should just go to other subreddit, please link me there </e1>   since  <e2> I do not know that much about this </e2>  . 
Everything is angering me today, everything and everyone	I feel like I can't control my emotional, vitriolic reactions to peoples' words	 <e1> Everything is angering me today, everything and everyone </e1>  .   <e2> I feel like I can't control my emotional, vitriolic reactions to peoples' words </e2>  , though I'm usually a level-headed, calm individual.  I hate this.  I am ANGRY.  I'm sad.  I'm crying and screaming at people who love me.  And it's not even noon.   Fuck my doctor for prescribing me this shit (Zenzedi).  Fuck me for taking so much of it.   Sorry all.  It's so hard to be positive today.  I'm getting a haircut in a few hours (on no sleep) and I just want to dose.  I scoured my house looking for a hit I might have dropped.  That's fucking low.   *Also, I still can't get into the Kik chat.  My name's miranda__rights on there.  If a mod is reading this, please help me out? :)*
I	me.	I have started drinking again.  I was going to make a meeting yesterday but decided to be an idiot and find reasons not to go.   Anyway, for the past 2 weeks all I've been having are dreams where in high as fuck.   And doing drugs I don't even like.  Like crack, and heroin.   I mean I like opiates but not heroin.   But idk what to do.  I do want to go down that road but I know it ends badly for me. 
I recently found out that my closest friend from high school is in an institution	he was found not guilty by reason of insanity	 <e1> I recently found out that my closest friend from high school is in an institution </e1>  because  <e2> he was found not guilty by reason of insanity </e2> . (for a violent crime) Our friendship blew up years ago and i now know it was all a symptom of his schizophrenia.  I still care deeply about him and i want to reach out.  I think a letter might be less abrasive than just calling him.  What do i say? Is it even worth a shot? 
I don't believe that I live in a nice city	i don't deserve it	I don't experience things fully that I don't think I deserve.   <e1> I don't believe that I live in a nice city </e1>  because  <e2> i don't deserve it </e2> .  Same thing for my car.  But I experience the cold outdoors fully because I can feel it.  
Does	welcome.	Does anybody else here ever have fantasies about killing the people who abused us throughout our lives?  Now I'm not saying that I would ever act on the fantasies, but I am curious to see how common of an occurrence this is.   Thoughts or experiences are very welcome.  
This	words.	This sub keeps me grounded and on track with my degree, just in case NDad goes nuclear again and I have to get my little brother out of there.  Thanks friends! For sharing your ups and downs and heartbreaks and triumphs.  The support here is valuable beyond words.  
Hi	Initially	Hi guys.    From a young(er) age, I've had many times where I think excessively and worry excessively about how others think about me, how things will occur perhaps in exams or in social events and activities.  This time, I'm worried about an upcoming trip to South Korea.    I've never really read the news much, and I'm not sure if this is due to my lack of knowledge about world issues, but I started reading up on world news over the past week, and the events have been pretty scary.  Makes me feel like just hiding in a hole and sleeping my life away.    I'm going to South Korea with some friends this upcoming week, and I keep thinking What if this happens? and What if that happens?.  Initially
I was most worried about weddings	I'm an introvert with social anxiety and they're long, there's lots of strangers, and the main focus is dancing (which I don't enjoy)	Yesterday I went to a wedding - my first one sober.   <e1> I was most worried about weddings </e1>   as  <e2> I'm an introvert with social anxiety and they're long, there's lots of strangers, and the main focus is dancing (which I don't enjoy) </e2>  .   However- not only did nobody bat an eye at my drinking iced tea, I actually had a good time catching up with old acquaintances.   Once everyone started to get dull and a bit slurry from the alcohol, I decided to push myself even further and hit the dance floor. . .  And you know what? It wasn't bad, and was even a bit fun.   It was my first time dancing with my husband sober, so that was a new experience.   This morning I'm clear-headed, I remember everything, and I don't feel that horrible shame and question of what did I say to whom?.  I was also less annoying for my partner and friends as normally I'd start whining to leave early
they're asleep	its midnight where I live	I have already carved a word into my skin and cut myself rather deep tonight, I'm feeling extremely suicidal but it is hitting me in bursts, I sometimes feel like I'm definitely going to kill myself tonight and other times like right now I have the sense to want to get help.  My parents are home and quite supportive of my illnesses but  <e1> they're asleep </e1>   as  <e2> its midnight where I live </e2>  .  I'm panicking and I'm not in walking distance of a hospital.  I'm a 16 year old male.  Am I able to call an ambulance and tell them I'm in a mental health emergency? Please answer asap, I'm really scared, I've been in a psych ward and I only got out 2 weeks ago.  I have psychotic depression and anxiety.  Please help, tell me what I can do, I'd really rather not wake my parents up.  Is calling an ambulance an option?
she still has problems interacting with others	she's actually been kicked out of some extracurricular activities	My kid has been diagnosed and on medication for about a year now and it seems to help quite a bit.   She's been tested to have a high IQ and is currently reading at a 7th grade level, in fact books are one of the few things she will sit and focus on for long periods.   But  <e1> she still has problems interacting with others </e1>   to the point that  <e2> she's actually been kicked out of some extracurricular activities </e2>  .   First of all she sometimes just blurts out really inappropriate and insulting comments to other kids.   Then anytime there's any sort of social rejection or argument at all she gets extremely upset and just can't let it go to the point she just has a complete melt down, or tries to run away.   Also, sometimes when the other kids make her mad she will hide under tables and growl and hiss at people like an animal and completely disregard the adults input from then on out until she's physically removed from the environment.   I'm having a heck of a time finding a solution for these issues.   Does anyone have any suggestions? 
I've	symptoms?	I've had anxiety for a long time but the agoraphobia set in 4-5 months ago after 3 years of a panic disorder.  I've noticed that I get a lot of odd physical symptoms aside from just panic attack feelings  general anxiety when I leave the house.  I get REALLY tense shoulders (and a lot of times wind up awkwardly massaging my shoulders in an attempt to calm me down), as well as feeling spatially disoriented and getting weird vertigo sensations.  I also sometimes feel coldshivery.  I also get the distinct feeling that something is about to jump out and grabattack me.  I would think that these sensations are caused by something else, but they only happen when I'm outside of my home and especially in unfamiliar situations.  Does anyone else get strange agoraphobic symptoms?
I don't like being around people	it makes me feel stressed	I love to be alone.   <e1> I don't like being around people </e1>  ,  <e2> it makes me feel stressed </e2>  .  I'm afraid about what they may do next, what they might say to me next, what they might ask me next.  I just want to be by myself, in my own place, with my computer, my keyboard, my guitar, and my bed.  I'm a teen, so I don't really have that choice, but to be honest, nobody really does, no matter  how old they are.  You always have to be around people for one reason or another.  I'm just never comfortable around people anymore. 
It was the best decision I ever made	My boss has noticed significant improvement in me, my anxiety and mood have improved dramatically, I'm down 14 pounds.   Most importantly, after 12 years of alcohol abuse I finally feel free	Hi all, Just wanted to share with everyone.  I was always highly functional, I missed work maybe a half dozen times over the years (I'm 30).  I was a runner when I wasn't too hungover.  I was good at my job.   I also drank a lot.  Usually 5-8 drinks a weeknight and between 10-20 on weekends.  Maybe once a month i'd get into the blow and have a 6am night followed by a crushing hangover and then just a normal hangover on the second day.  One hundred days ago after 20 beers and a dripping nose I decided to quit.   <e1> It was the best decision I ever made </e1>  .  I woke up at 8am this morning, had coffee with my fiancee, had a great breakfast then went out leisurely biking around the city for hours exploring new areas.  Then I came back and ran a half marathon.  Now I am going to go out and have dinner to celebrate.    <e2> My boss has noticed significant improvement in me, my anxiety and mood have improved dramatically, I'm down 14 pounds.   Most importantly, after 12 years of alcohol abuse I finally feel free </e2>  . 
I dont really want to post more about it here	I'm embarrassed and shy	That's really it.   <e1> I dont really want to post more about it here </e1>  because  <e2> I'm embarrassed and shy </e2> .  If anyone would be willing to listen and just help me out it might improve my life so much.  Right now I haven't had anyone to talk to and its all been held in. 
Even	that?	Even people who are supposed to understand online, or people in support groups, or even therapists etc.  clearly just don't like dealing with you? Like, you're encouraged to go to these places to find people who can relate or understand or help and then they just remind you that, no, you weren't imagining it, people really do want rid of you and think you're annoying, etc.  How do you ever get around that?
I've this urge for nonexistence	I just don't want to exist as I do, and as far as I've experienced, my existence is one based on a foundation of depression and apathy	I've been depressed my whole life.  As a child, teen and now a young adult.  I've tried a I'm numerous occasions to medicate, attend therapies, and nothing has seemed to help.  I suppose my question is this: is there hope? I'm not particularly prone to suicidal ideation, but I don't want to exist.   <e1> I've this urge for nonexistence </e1> . . . but not because I want to die.   <e2> I just don't want to exist as I do, and as far as I've experienced, my existence is one based on a foundation of depression and apathy </e2> .  I'm 28.  As far back as I can recall, I've been this way.  Yo.  Any tips and tricks for NOT killing yourself? Any tips and tricks for drafting apathy? Finding motivation?  Anyways, thanks for your time.  I appreciate it.  
I	do.	I don't know how to say why I can't hold down a job.  Or why little things can be extremely difficult.  Why sometimes I look like I'm really okay.  Why it is really difficult near impossible to open up to people.  I'm sorry for being a dramatic little bitch I just feel like an idiot when people tell me I'm just being lazy or I just need something to do.  
After	meaning	After much speculation I decided I would stay to pay debt back to somebody I know.  Then I remembered they probably only loaned me the money out of guilt for trying to murder me years ago.  Then I remembered nobody even cared that they tried this, or when other people threatened my life (physically).  I can't help but wish that I didn't fight it, that somebody had succeeded.  I wish I succeeded when I tried.  Yes I have tried before, the psych ward, therapy and drugs didn't help.  Sadly paying off debt was just about the only logical reason I could come up with for staying here.  If three people not including myself have wanted me dead so badly, they have actively tried to murder me, why is it wrong for me to feel like that too? I keep trying to better myself and become worthy but honestly I'm a pretty shitty person.  I have been searching for meaning
Withdrawal	too.	Withdrawal is a necessary bitch we all know.  She's got all the moves and kept me coming back for more.   However, for the first time since I started H, I finally kicked it without relapsing.   By no means is the battle over, I'm just curious.  Anyone else happy for actually be interested in things again? I was so vacant for so long, but today I felt genuinely curious.  Feels good.   It's fun to eat again too.  
I	it!	I somehow managed 1 month.   When I first started my cold turkey quit, I didn't think I would make it a day.   But I took it day by day and made it this far.  I still get cravings here and there while doing certain things, but it's no longer something I have to fight my will for.   I just put it out of my mind and I'm good now.  All you guys out there that haven't made it this far or are still wary of starting. . .  Don't Worry! Looking back, that one month wasn't really too horrible.   It just seems like it will be.  And it's that dread that makes it horrible.   You can do it! If I can do it, anyone can do it! 
I know a lot of my rejection is	this	Probably the most hurtful thing anyone's ever said to me.  I'm pretty self-conscious because I don't fit the typical masculine stereotype (e. g muscular, aggressive, typical interests etc. ), and  <e1> I know a lot of my rejection is </e1>  because of  <e2> this </e2> .  I've been outright told that I'm too nice and would make a great gay best-friend.  It's been months since the statement in question (she even apologized) and I'm still struggling everyday to find worth in myself.  I'm super lonely and desperately wanting to be intimate with someone
Depression	try	Depression has slowly been taking over my life, I don't want to do anything nothing sounds appealing.  The days I do have energy I spend it cleaning or doing other necessities.  I have no appetite all I can think about is how sad I am.  I used to be so happy and outgoing it feels like no matter how hard I try
Those 2 weeks were the worst I have been	I posted in this subreddit in the first place	While working the topic of drinking came up.  He joked about alcoholism, and I said how else would I handle depression.  I talked to him about it and told him that while not currently depressed(it's working back up though) that I was recently depressed for 2 weeks.   <e1> Those 2 weeks were the worst I have been </e1>  , it was the reason  <e2> I posted in this subreddit in the first place </e2>  , along with a question in Suicide Watch.  Thing is, he isn't my best friend.  His girlfriend is my best friend, and she has no clue about what happened and the thought process.  Neither does my other best friend.  So, I am wondering if I should tell him that he is the only one to know this, and whether to tell him to keep on the down low.  I don't want any weird conversations in case he discusses it with someone.  I don't think he will, but who knows.  Sorry for the long rant. . . 
I've been suffering from Depression and obesity since I was a young teen and I've reached my max weight I've ever been	It's becoming hard to walk, to wipe, to breath	I'm 24 years old.   <e1> I've been suffering from Depression and obesity since I was a young teen and I've reached my max weight I've ever been </e1>  .   <e2> It's becoming hard to walk, to wipe, to breath </e2>  .  I know in my heart this is the cause of my depression.  And I need to make a drastic change but I lack the ability to control myself.  If I could, I would want nothing more than to be locked away so someone could control me.  Which leads me to this desperate time in my life.  I feel it's in my best interest to remove myself from temptation and get on a bus and just leave.  I think I could live in the woods.  That's the current plan.  I'm going to travel to some woods far away from home and live in there until I lose my weight or die trying.  
I	friend	I found a flat with this nice lady.  It'll just be the two of us and we even have our own bathrooms.  She has a dog and said she wouldn't mind if I got one too.  I can't afford one right now and need to cut back costssave for a few months while I pay for this new place first, but finally I'll have a close friend 
I	linked?	I think he may be right.  Reading this sub, I'm finding a whole lot in common with many people here.  It is about as relevatory to me as when I browsed rbipolar when I first got diagnosed with that.  I wonder now whether my bipolar has anything to do with the potential CPTSD.  I wonder if my childhood has anything to do with my asexuality too.  Anyway I thought I'd just say hello.  I'm sort of emotionally frazzled after my appointment and I guess posting here is some sort of validation to me.  I'm just so sad right now, but hopeful.  Edit: there's real paucity of material exploring asexuality and cPTSD, so very little that this is one of the top Google results when you search for cPTSD and asexuality.  If you find yourself in the same boat, feel free to message me, I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether the two could be linked? 
Saving it towards a car how proud will I feel driving it knowing it's	I quit Feeling positive	This is about my 10th time of quitting my longest is 12 weeks not smoking.  Determination this time no going back! Saving the money this time nice watching it grow.   <e1> Saving it towards a car how proud will I feel driving it knowing it's </e1>  because  <e2> I quit Feeling positive </e2> 
this subreddit	I made it through the last couple of days	Hi everyone.  New here.  I've rapidly tapered over the past week, I'm now down to 4 measuring teaspoons per day (one every 4-6 hours), after 4-5 years of daily use.  I'm reaching the point where I'd have to re-order, I have a family wedding in a month and my birthday in 2, I have a meeting with an addiction service on Friday, basically I'm reaching the point of no return.  I'm optimistic, pessimistic, euphoric, terrified, depressed, all at the same time.  I don't really know why I'm posting, but  <e1> this subreddit </e1>   is the only reason  <e2> I made it through the last couple of days </e2>  .  I should be getting back on antidepressants in the next few days, will this help? I believe it will be Mirtazipine.  Does anyone have any experience dealing with pre-existing anxietydepression during withdrawals? Thanks
they are far more distressing than any of my compulsions and 2 - I rarely talk about my compulsions	I am very ashamed of them)	Over the past few months, I've been to see several mental health professionals.  Last week, I was put on antidepressants to help manage my intrusive thoughts (the doctors always focus on my intrusive thoughts since 1 - When they are moderatesevere,  <e1> they are far more distressing than any of my compulsions and 2 - I rarely talk about my compulsions </e1>  because  <e2> I am very ashamed of them) </e2> .  I suffer from intrusive, obsessive thoughts, which vary over time in terms of their severity.  Last year, they were consistently severe for about 8 months.  Now, they fluctuate a lot, and right now they happen to be very mild.  I also have a few compulsions, (and I am extremely embarrassed to have to discuss this) my main one being this routine where I pickrip at my nails, scrape off the skin around my nails, etc.  Little conscious thought goes into it, and there's no particular reason why I do it, I just feel the need to do it for whatever reason.  Once I decide that I'm finished, I look over my fingers to check that it's exactly right (i. e: my nails are symmetrical, no skin left, everything eat-looking)
My	bed.	My family wished me happy birthday which made me feel guilty about my thoughts.  I don't want to hurt them but at the same time I feel like I can't solve all the problems in my life.  I still wish I was some one else.  I called the suicide hotline but got nervous and cancelled.  I want to ask for help but I'm scared to.  I'm still keeping my new years promise if things don't get better by new years I will kill my self.  I feel like I have wasted so much time.  I stayed up all night I'm going to bed. 
I also wish people would take a bit more time to understand me	when I first meet someone	I have such a hatred for people that I always go to meetings or social events with a negative mindset and that obviously doesn't help.  I always assume that these people will behave in a way that will upset me or make me feel worse even though it's probably not true.   Obviously, this comes from bad experiences in the past but I need to find a way to have a neutral mind when meeting others so it doesn't put me off.   <e1> I also wish people would take a bit more time to understand me </e1>  because  <e2> when I first meet someone </e2> ; don't expect me to talk a lot.  That just doesn't happen.  Once I become more acquainted with someone then I can open up to them and actually be a good friend (I think).  I understand why people don't do that.  Some people try quite a lot and I don't respond, but I still wish people tried.  Especially if it's a one on one situation.  I know it's quite irrationalsilly to think like this though.  
I	this?	I stopped drinking.  I'm working harder and by all accounts, life is MUCH better.  My relationship with my wife and kids is WAY better.  Here's the thing - due to my behavior during my 20 years of drinking, there's a lot of room for self-improvement.  I get self-conscious about attempts to improve myself.  Its like the harder I work, the more I expose my pathetic previous effort.  I'm worried that I'll show everyone I care about how weak I am and have been.  I'm embarrassed that I haven't been the man I should have.   My family and friends don't really know how much of an issue I've had with alcohol.  They all still drink.  I don't have a local support system about alcohol and I've never been to a therapist for real.  Neither of those are in my life even though they would probably be beneficial. That's my issue - my fear or shame about my years long behavior is a roadblock for me and I need help to get past it.  Have you ever dealt with something like this?
Im	past.	Im slowly starting to accept that my parents will never give me the support I so desperately crave.   But heres a thought,  maybe my mom loves me despite being so manipulative.   Maybe she is doing the best she can.  That being said, would it make me a terrible person if I decided to cut ties with her?  I don't see many redeeming qualities in our relationship and the only love she knows is conditional.   I feel my life would be much better off, but I already feel guilty just typing this out.  P. S.  The quote applies to my dad as well, he only enabled my moms behaviors, and was never around when I was growing up.   I find myself wanted the father I never had but I know that part of my life has past. 
What	all?	What helps you all when you're struggling with dissociative feelings? I can deal with feeling anxious or depressed somewhat better.  But that dissociation, that weird numb empty I don't feel like myself - or anyone at all is hard to shake.   What kinds of things help you all?
Ive	honest.	Ive looked up DPLA but not sure what it can do for Kratom WD.   Is it safe to take everyday?  Also does anyone use BCAA amino acid for recovery? If been using just a regular one a day multivitamin. . . anybody know of anything better to use as a Multi?  Any help appreciated.  Thanks!  Ive tapered down to 7-8 grams a day but having trouble getting lower than that without feeling major anxiety and basically like totally crap to be honest.  
Hi,	how?	Hi, I'm new here.  Came in search of fellow anxious people dealing with heart palpitations.  I've had them for about two and a half years now.  I sometimes have days or weeks with none, and then if I get stressed for a long period or don't sleep well, or drink alcohol, or eat too much sugar, or who knows what the hell makes it happen. . . . they come back with a vengeance.  Yesterday I had a tough day at work and I had more than ever - probably 30-50 throughout the day.  Today was better but this evening I have one every 10 minutes or so.  Just had one writing that sentence.  I wish I could figure out exactly what causes them and make them stop.  I've tried so many things and it's just exhausting and terrifying at the same time.  (Yes I've been to the cardiologist and ruled out any structural issues with my heart. ) Anyone else dealing with this? If so. . . . how? 
I knew I was getting really down	I became so distant, not speaking.  My face went straight, no emotion.  I barely moved my head and eyes from the road	Today when getting some ice cream with a couple friends,  <e1> I knew I was getting really down </e1>  .   <e2> I became so distant, not speaking.  My face went straight, no emotion.  I barely moved my head and eyes from the road </e2>  .  What really got to me, they didn't notice, they kept on having such a great time.  I felt so shitty for doing this to them, for being a buzz kill and being yet again another disappointment.  All I want is for someone to finally be concerned or take notice.  Do any of them actually care, or am I just a fake friend they like to bring along? Why must I be tortured so? What have I done? I only want someone to finally care, to be the one that I can at long last open up to, pour out my emotions.  WHY is all I can think, alongside the thoughts of suicide.  Please, someone care.  I can't even cry no matter how much I want to.  Please. . .  
I	parents	I want to die all the time.  I don't necessarily want to kill myself, not all the time, but I'd like to die and have nobody remember me.  I don't want to even live on in the thoughts of loved ones.    So why am I still alive? Life is temporary.  I remind myself of how little time we have and that in the grand scheme of things my suffering is short.  Maybe one day I'll see something cool enough to make me feel like it was worth it.  If not, I still get to die eventually, and knowing that is what keeps me moving.   Today is harder than most, but tomorrow could be the day that I see something worth living another day for.  I'm glad I didn't crash my car into that ditch even though every neuron firing in my brain shouted, do it! I'm not going to eat my bottle of Xanax and wash it down with gin tonight.     Nobody I know in real life (basically my parents
Nothingness?	nothing	Nothingness? Empty?Are those the words you would use to describe it? Im not happy or really content with who or where I am or feeling anything really.  But Im not depressed feeling either.  Im not angry or anxious.  Im not anything.  Using the word empty feels too. . . . negative.  Like Im missing something but Im not missing anything.  Im just here.  At this time.  No emotions.  Nothing.  Does that actually make sense to anyone? After you've been holding in everything that you've felt for two days only to have this day end in nothing.  Its bittersweet.  Normally Im having such a tornado of emotions that Im changing moods one minute to the next but this is my all time favorite.  The nothingness.  Not being annoyingly bubbly but not being a debbie downer. . . or being a bundle of rage, sadness, and tears.  Just this nothing
It's just so hard	when I'm not alone I can almost feel human and not wanna die for minute but I'm alone so much that it doesn't really do matter	I'm kinda just shit at being a person, I'm dropping out of art school because I've just sorta given up on myself I guess and the loneliness has been making me so ready to just die.  As long as I can remember I've thought of killing my self or hurting myself usual against my will, like was being forced to be suicidal but not anymore I'm fully on board these days.  The only keeping me from doing it is I couldn't bare to cause my mother any pain so every day I think about just walking into traffic, I'm dumb enough that people would buy it was an accident but I don't wanna force someone to live with that.   <e1> It's just so hard </e1>  because  <e2> when I'm not alone I can almost feel human and not wanna die for minute but I'm alone so much that it doesn't really do matter </e2> .  I just don't wanna hurt anyone but I really wanna die. 
I	friends	I am 30 yo M, for years iv'e been latching to my bf for any interaction. As a teen it was hard to make friends, now its even harder. Once in a blue moon we meet with my bf's colleaguesfriends and its rather uncomfortable they all talk about jobs, mortgages and kids. . . Sliding in the conversation saying today I got to hyperfocus and play a game for 12h would be weird.   For me managing to fix up a hot meal and not break down its a good day.  My psychiatrist tells me how I should make friends
I	up.	I have a method in my room with me and it has been my safety net for a few months.  I'm really wanting to use it.  No matter what happens I will hurt and others will hurt.  Even if I end my pain, I will just transfer it plus more to anyone who cares.  Even people who don't know me.  People have been dying on the train lines lately and I am so sad for them when I hear.  I don't even know them.  It would be the same way.   I never thought I was going to live to be an adult, it just didn't seem like a reality that would happen to me.  As it gets closer it doesn't get any more realistic.  I just can't let it happen.  I'm never going to be ready for it.   I forgot to go to work.  That's a pretty dumb thing to start tonight's whole downward spiral.  I have such an animalistic need to be excellent at my work.  My worth hinges on it.  And I just forgot to go.  That's never happened before.  I am just not ready to grow up. 
I was going to kill myself anyways	who cares about debt	Fuck this shit.  I really thought I was 'done' with this.  I've been severely depressed and was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago.  Been through therapy, admitted to a psych ward, self-harmed, suicidal, was on anti-depressants etc.  Accrued massive student debts because  <e1> I was going to kill myself anyways </e1>  , so  <e2> who cares about debt </e2>  .   And then after a few years of pure misery. .  magically
Mental	anymore?	Mental pain, I mean.  I'm in so much pain everyday and I just can't kill myself.  I've tried and I can't do it.  There's no escape.  Am I just going to break down and go crazy because my mind can't deal with the pain anymore? 
Twice	it.	Twice today i was ready to go.  I've been close before but not this close.  I tried sleeping after the first time but it just made things much worse, i was just extremely disappointed when i woke up.  I had written goodbye and was about to send it to the person i was talking to (chatting with) and go do it, when something distracted me (my memory is a little hazy).  I regret just having waited  talked to someone and not having done it when i could have, i still want to die  think there's no other option anyway for a list of reasons that would take a huge wall of text to explain, but i doubt i could still do it now.  At this point i'm basically just waiting to get triggered again to then be able to do it, which shouldn't take too long considering how many things trigger me.  I'm still far from stable, although not acutely in danger even without tranquilizer at the moment, and would like to know if any of you have tips for dealing with the regrets  feelings after almost having gone through with it. 
Back	interviews?	Back in February I applied to my dream company, I had a phone interview, followed by a scheduled interview that got cancelled, then rescheduled and a third interview with a tour of the company.  Overall super stressful and dealing with the anxiety has been brutal and exhausting.  Yesterday I was left a voicemail that they said they chose an internal candidate but I was very close to getting the job and if they could consider me for other positions.  Today I got a phone call from a different department in the same company wanting to interview me for a different position and that the other department gave me a glowing review.  So now I have an interview scheduled for the end of this week, I feel like I am all over the place with my anxiety and its been hard to manage with all the changes.  I have been trying to cope but it's just getting exhausting and having interview after interview is just getting worse not better.  Does anyone have any tips so that I can not seem so nervous during these interviews?
Let's	Netflix.	Let's accumulate a list here of different ways we all deal with our anxiety.  Obviously, there is no cure-all method, but everyone has at least something that helps, and maybe you'll find some new ideas that can help you.  Here are a few examples of what helps me when I feel anxious or have an anxiety attack: Reading, scrolling through Reddit, petting an animal, listening to music, creating a new playlist, and finding a new show on Netflix. 
I	track?	I knew my drinking had been heavy these past few months but my elevated liver enzymes have scared me enough to quit drinking.  I'm on day 5 of being sober and finally feeling okay with sobriety, and with the thought of not having to have alcohol to have fun.  Anyway, I'm pretty desperate to get my liver enzymes down, I'm following a good diet regime, in the gym 6 days a week take a multivitamin all that good stuff but has anyone had any success with taking milk thistle or a liver detox supplement that I could buy from one of my local health stores to get my liver back on the right track? 
He told me I can't break up with him if it's	I feel like I don't deserve him because it's his decision to decide that, not mine	I keep telling him I don't deserve him, I won't get better, and that he deserves to find someone that's not the way I am.  That doesn't get upset at everything the way I do.  That is normal and bubbly and happy and doesn't constantly snap.   <e1> He told me I can't break up with him if it's </e1>  because  <e2> I feel like I don't deserve him because it's his decision to decide that, not mine </e2> .  He doesn't see me the way that I am.  He's hopeful that I'll get better but he doesn't understand that I won't, I'll always be like this.  I don't know how to make him realize that so he doesn't waste more time with me.  I don't know what to do. 
i dont think i want him to spend $ 8,000 on 32 counseling sessions	i could probably get the same value with finding a sponsor	dad wants to spend $ 8,000 on outpatient counseling sessions im going into detox next week and after that he wants to spend $ 8,000 on 32 sessions at some hoag outpatient center.  where i come in 3 times a week to do sessions with them.  not really a big fan of that.    im pretty much on subooxone 2mg a day and i smoke h on weekends and my dad caught me smoking h one weekend and now wants to detox me.   im fine with that but  <e1> i dont think i want him to spend $ 8,000 on 32 counseling sessions </e1>   when  <e2> i could probably get the same value with finding a sponsor </e2>   (i have one and its my manager at work). . . and doing the 12 steps instead of paying $ 8,000 bones.  any advice or refferals for addiction speicalists or psychologists than he can just pay by the hour instead of paying $ 8,000 for 32 sessoins . . . . sessions that im afraid wont even work. 
I feel like such a failure	I can't move on	When I try to read or learn, I experience flashback of abuse in the past and break down in tears.  I no longer want to try anything anymore.  People just keep telling me to stop thinking about the past, but this doesn't work, I'm telling you.   <e1> I feel like such a failure </e1>  because  <e2> I can't move on </e2> .  
I	is	I always found this song to be profoundly sad on a deep level.  I love what the lead singer, John Darnielle, said about the song on an interview with NPR in 2005: The point of the song is
I have alway been very awkward socially	I hate small talk, i will avoid people I know in a store	I have a problem where I am tremendously socially awkward and at the same time, totally apathetic towards other people's daily lives.  I live in an apartment complex for low income families.  It's mostly mothers with kids and only a few are married couples (like myself and my husband).    <e1> I have alway been very awkward socially </e1>  .   <e2> I hate small talk, i will avoid people I know in a store </e2>   so I don't have to speak with them, I never know if I'm supposed to say Hi to every parent I recognize at school, Etc.  Many of the mothers in my complex sit outside and smoke cigarettes together or are just generally in each other's business a ton and always gossiping.  Many people warned me of this when I moved in here but I just figured I'd be my quiet awkward self and no one would bother me.  I also am kind of unique in the fact that chit chat about people's lives is so incredibly boring and a waste of time for me.  I hate having to catch up with people that haven't actively tried to be in my life when I bump into them somewhere
I also got very aggressive when I was done playing games,	I'd be angry if I lost	I have been playing games for about 12 years now, but within the past 3 years, it's gotten really bad.  I wouldn't make time for anything else and barely pass classes.  Within these past 3 weeks, I finally noticed what the root to my addictive gaming habit is. . .  and I found out that it's the type of games I play.  I play a ton of multiplayer games with my friends.  I'm a very competitive person, so I always wanted to win, which made me play way too much.   <e1> I also got very aggressive when I was done playing games, </e1>  because  <e2> I'd be angry if I lost </e2> .  On top of that, I have many friends who want me to get on and play, and I used to drop everything I was doing just to play a game online with them.  Once realizing this, I decided to switch back to my old roots of gaming, which are singleplayer games.  Within the past 3 weeks, I have played about 11 hours of games, compared to the 50-60 hours I would spend in just 1 week before realizing this.  I wanted to share hoping this might help someone else
I	out.	I decided to quit while I was sick with a stomach thing (smoking made me feel way sicker).  Now that I'm feeling mostly better, I'm back at work and I have to face the stresses of life (many) without cigarettes.  I keep wondering how people do this.  They just handle shit without having to take a break and smoke.  They're like aliens to me.  How am I gonna do this? I get so depressed and I've been so moody and angry wo them.  I don't want to go back.  Somebody tell me it's temporary and I'll figure it out. 
1.	positive**	1.  Week one: Wife had a miscarriage. 2.  Week two: I got fired with a month notice.  3.  Week three: I fought with my brother4.  Week four: Being fired and packing my stuff5.  Week five: Interview for a new job.  (scary as hell) These were the bigger triggers, I occasionally run into people smoking, I occasionally have to deal with an idiot who triggers my inner trigger to smoke.  Sometimes I get very sad about losing my unborn baby, which is really emotionally straining.  I was super excited.   Every being in me tells me to smoke, every cell in me thinks I deserve it.  But I made a promise to myself, and I respect myself that much to keep that promise to myself.   Ignore all the grammar and spelling mistakes, if I go back to editing this I'll just delete the whole thing.   **Stay positive**
Hi	:)	Hi everyone! I'm a radio journalist who has been reading this subreddit for a while.  I'm working on a story about addiction, and I would love to work with one of you to tell your own story about leaving gaming in real time.  My hope is that this will be beneficial to you as well if you are someone who has had trouble really committing to quitting or are worried about having too much time on your hands.  If you are thinking about quitting soon and would like to work with me, please get in touch! Thank you :)
I went into this week realizing that my boyfriend's week was going to be rushed, stressed, and full of things to be done	my expectations for him celebrating my birthday were low	Yesterday was my birthday.   <e1> I went into this week realizing that my boyfriend's week was going to be rushed, stressed, and full of things to be done </e1>  .  So  <e2> my expectations for him celebrating my birthday were low </e2>  ; apparently they weren't low enough.   Not a card.  No flowers.  A last minute idea for dinner to a restaurant that I don't even particularly enjoy.  And he has the nerve to ask me what's wrong when we sit down to order.   All I wanted was to have him make me feel like I was someone worth celebrating in his life.  For him to acknowledge all the work I do for him and for us every day.     I wanted to feel special, and now I just feel like shit.  
I've	curious.	I've had a good response to my SSRI (Celexa).   10mg pulled me out of a terrible depression.   20mg was a minor improvement.   30mg was another minor improvement.   Now we're going up to 40mg, and my psychiatrist says that we should expect only minorincremental improvement, which makes sense intuitively.   Given that the last two increases yielded minor improvements, you'd expect either a minor improvement or no improvement at all (benefit tapers off).   But is it ***possible*** for some big improvement to occur when you cross a certain critical dose threshold?  Has this happened to you or anyone you know?  I know it's all anecdotal and specific to the individual, but I'm curious.  
I	working.	I ask my manager a work question on something  I was working on today.  She was shocked at this question  after pointing working out I've been there 7 months I didn't know the answer to something  I should already.   The whole day I kept thinking  how stupid I was and if I should be there working.   
It really has me worried	all the other symptoms anxiety entails, which makes me think I have some random disease or something like that	It sucks that I can get random anxiety attacks no matter where I am or what I'm thinking of, even if my thoughts are stress-free.  Now, I have to ask: Does anyone else suffered from increased saliva in their mouths during their anxiety, or even before?   <e1> It really has me worried </e1>  because of  <e2> all the other symptoms anxiety entails, which makes me think I have some random disease or something like that </e2> .  (It's an awful thing to think, I know. ) I'd really love to hear anyone relate to this in anyway.  
I am still so unable to focus and get things done	it makes my anxiety amp up even more	Hello, all.  I've recently started seeing a psychiatrist for my extreme anxiety issues, and she prescribed me 0. 5mg xanax 3 times daily.  It's been about a week, and they are somewhat managing my panic attacks, but  <e1> I am still so unable to focus and get things done </e1>  that  <e2> it makes my anxiety amp up even more </e2>  .  My question is- has anyone with anxiety and ADHD found a system that works for them? I'm considering asking my doctor for trying out adderallvyvanese in the am to combat my inability to focus, which I think will generally help with my anxiety. . .  and then only taking the Xanax on an as needed basis instead of 3x daily.  Any thoughts on this? This is the first time I've genuinely connected with a doctor and felt hopeful for help in resolving my issues.  Thank you so much. 
immersed yourself in an unhealthy lifestyle	addiction	Just found this sub, and I'm pretty disgusted at all the people that are getting mad at or mocking folks for trying to get help with a problem they want fixed.   To help illustrate the real effects game addiction can have, [here is an article written back in 2009 that should really shed light on why game addiction can be terrible.  I recommend anyone who wants to scoff at the idea of a gaming addiction read that article and see what it's like from rock bottom for some folk; when you've lost friends, ended relationships, and  <e1> immersed yourself in an unhealthy lifestyle </e1>  because of this  <e2> addiction </e2> . 
it's very hard for me to go a day without feeling disconnected and disassociated from everything	I keep having recollections of events that make me feel miserable	Any help would be greatly appreciated,  <e1> it's very hard for me to go a day without feeling disconnected and disassociated from everything </e1>  because  <e2> I keep having recollections of events that make me feel miserable </e2> .   It often comes without warning and I guess I have triggers for it as well, it's just becoming too much to bear trying to  even function properly while attempting to suppress it.  
I know that people may ignore me	I was shit-tier in the past	I used to struggle with depression and anxiety a lot.  In the past, I failed some quizzes, exams, and assignments.  I was also often absent.   I decided to get my shit together and stop giving up on myself.  Despite doing shittly in the past, I want to give research a shot at my college this semester as well as start a new mini club at my college.   <e1> I know that people may ignore me </e1>  as  <e2> I was shit-tier in the past </e2>   and they may dislike the idea of extra work but pretty much everyone on Reddit told me to go for it and that I should email the professors and college to ask about both things.  I did and guess what? **Both of them did not reply. ** Now I am feeling extremely anxious and that both parties are ignoring me, seeing me as a joke, laughing behind my back, etc. 
Both of us know that's not the truth but I'm too afraid to admit that to someone that isn't close family or a therapist	I'm scared of what they would think about me or say about me	Whenever I get the question whats the matter or what's wrong I always lie and say I didn't sleep or that I'm (physically) sick.   <e1> Both of us know that's not the truth but I'm too afraid to admit that to someone that isn't close family or a therapist </e1>  because  <e2> I'm scared of what they would think about me or say about me </e2> .  
I have a fear of flying and of driving on the highway	my mom was hit by a drunk driver when I was little	I'm 25 and felt like I've barely traveled enough.  When I was younger my family went to Italy three times to see family (I'm from the US).  In general my family has barely traveled when I was younger, and now they say you're too old to go with your parents on vacation.  We've never been to Disney, The Grand Canyon, etc. . .  I want to go explore, but I just don't want to go by myself.   <e1> I have a fear of flying and of driving on the highway </e1>  because  <e2> my mom was hit by a drunk driver when I was little </e2> . . . it's been holding me back for so long I don't know what to do.  This week has been my April break from work, and I've just felt so empty and upset that I have no partner that I could have traveled with.  
I	is.	I recently watched 13 reasons why, I thought I could handle it. .  I didn't know the rape scenes were so intense.  I was ok until it was Hannah's time to lose everything.  I watched her lifeless body get raped.  In that moment I felt the door I had everything locked and bolted down in open and everything flooded out.  I was about to check myself into a psychiatric unit.  Anyways I  did research and decided that 14 years with this rape defining me was enough.  Ruining every aspect of my life. .  MY life.  I just got back from an appointment with a man who specializes in PTSD.  I feel really good about this and for the first time in 14 years I'm ready to stop letting this define who I am, and letting it consume me.  I no longer want to be a rapeVictim.  I want to be me. . .  who ever that really is.  
I post this here	this is a result of smoking and being weak, unmotivated smoking and putting life on hold to smoke	I recently quit smoking.   I need to make huge changes.   I don't even know where to start.  I pissed away my teenage years and entire 20's smoking weed and working shit paying jobs.   If I could find a job just making ~$ 28k-~$ 30k per year I would be so much less stressed and happy.   I don't think I need a lot of money.   I thought about getting a cdl but I'm already extremely lonely and want to have a family.   I don't know how I could ever hope to accomplish that isolated on the road, I already don't meet people.   My next idea was the post office as they start at ~$ 16. 40.  Thanks in advance.   Just hoping for some ideas.   I like computers a lot and know my way around them.   Even a $ 14hr help desk job would be cool but I have 0 professional experience but I know I could do it.  <e1>  I post this here </e1>  because  <e2> this is a result of smoking and being weak, unmotivated smoking and putting life on hold to smoke </e2> . 
rstopdrinking	all!	 rstopdrinking Also, as someone with 35 days sober: Life really does get way better, and it basically happens by itself.  I almost feel like a fraud, like, who is this happy functional person who *volunteers* and *bakes bread* and *bicycles for fun* and *keeps plants alive*? (and literally dozens of other wonderful things?) Good luck, all!
I'm	anything.	I'm not super sure why I'm writing this but I'm feeling suicidal.  I was hospitalized for it but I don't have a ton of friends to talk to so I figured this was a good place to reach out anonymously? I'm open to talking about anything. 
So,	place	So, I asked this in rELI5 but my question was removed for being straightforward and the moderator talked down to me like I WAS 5.   TIL that ADHD is caused by a dopamine deficiency in the brain on those affected.  What I want to know is what causes the deficiency in the first place
All	it.	All of my pain and suffering and sadness stems from my anxiety.  All of it.  I don't let people in, I'm afraid of people, I'm afraid of talking to people, I'm anxious about my weight and my face and I hate the way I look, I'm considering starving myself but then I get anxious about the consequences and I'm anxious about how forgettable I am and I'm anxious about my lack of self esteem getting in the way of everything: my social life, my love life, my school, my career, everything.  Everything is so fucked up and I'm so anxious, I'm so overwhelmed, everything is so messed up and I'm too overwhelmed to fix it. 
I was going through a psychiatrist that is partnered with my university	I was previously not insured	Currently I'm going through the process of getting diagnosed for ADHD.  Because  <e2> I was previously not insured </e2>   <e1> I was going through a psychiatrist that is partnered with my university </e1> .  So far it's been 4 months since they started testing, and it seems kind of long.  I also have no idea if their close to being done.  I've gotten brief second opinions based off talking to a therapist and my primary care and they seem to strongly think that I have it but of course that's not concrete but it's making me more anxious about getting quick results.  I don't know anyone else who has been through this process but how long did it take you to get diagnosed? Also what was the process like after getting your diagnosis as far as getting treatment, and how long did that take to be established?  Sorry if this doesn't make sense, I'm new to reddit and I've been trying to write this as concisely as possible lol!
I have never discussed my manic episodes with past therapists	I only seeked therapy during depressions	I have seen some ads here and there for antidepressants specifically for bipolar depression and am hoping I could hear some first hand accounts.     I have seen therapists and been prescribed SSRIs (Citalopram and Lexapro) but they never did anything for me.   <e1> I have never discussed my manic episodes with past therapists </e1>   as  <e2> I only seeked therapy during depressions </e2>  .  After a extremely self-destructive manic episode last year followed by a crippling depression I have a strong feeling I am bipolar.    Any medication advice welcome, other medstherapy that might have worked for you. 
.	.	. . . Certain games.  No way was I trying or planning to quit gaming, but a certain circumstance just stopped it from happening.  I've noticed the main suggestion here is ''uninstall it!''.  Well, it's so easy to install it again.  Not so much though if you don't have your desktop no more and have to use a shitty laptop that doesn't run anything or runs it laggy af.  That's the situation I ended up in after moving houses recently, I didn't even want to stop gaming but here I am unable to game.  ANd the laptop pretty much suffices for everything else. . .  So there you go, get rid of your NASA computers and gaming will become unaccessible or a chore.  Unless you're addicted to Terraria.  That's a whole different issue. . . 
Today my friendship with my best friend ended today	it's really torn me apart	 <e1> Today my friendship with my best friend ended today </e1>   and  <e2> it's really torn me apart </e2>  .  She wasn't just my best friend but she was like my kindred spirit, we just connected on another level and had the most amazing connection.  I helped her through her own period of darkness, suicide plans, depression etc but today was the day she had enough and I got thrown out by her like the rubbish.  I'm not sure what the catalyst to this decision was but I could tell for a while that she had either grown tired of me or someone else had entered her life as she became very distant and withdrawn from me.    I've lost close friends before but this one has really affected me.  I officially have nobody left in my life I have been abandoned by everyone whom I have known.  Her exit from my life has left a hollow void in my life.  I do not see the purpose in continuing on with my life.  
I wanted to head somewhere and somehow got lost on the way'	I decided to just walk around random roads for no particular reason	I don't know what I was doing but  <e1> I wanted to head somewhere and somehow got lost on the way' </e1>  .  So  <e2> I decided to just walk around random roads for no particular reason </e2>  .  I wonder if that's a weird thing to do? I remember once that one older woman came out of her house to ask if I needed any help.  And when I'm out on the road people sometimes stop to ask if I need a lift.  After two hours and 30 minutes I managed to find my way back home.  I'm just worried that one day someone will call the police on me. 
Later on I was bullied	I was fat	I was told, as a child, that my introverted behavior and sensitiveness weren't ok and i was punished by my teachers for crying in kindergarten ( I was afraid my parents would forget about me).   <e1> Later on I was bullied </e1>  because  <e2> I was fat </e2> .  that lasted until I was about 14 years old.  That made me really insecure.  I was also put on a strict diet when i was only 7 so that made me have an unhealthy relationship with my body.  Some time ago I discovered makeup and I started buying it and spending time doing my makeup.  It means that I now spend time by myself doing thing for myself and I enjoy doing it.  It makes me more confident.  I feel that, in addition to the medication and therapy, makeup as been a relaxing thing that I do for my own enjoyment and it is really helpful 
Instead of the usual pink color, I received pills that were peach colored	the manufacturer had switched from CorePharma to AuroBindo	I recently got my prescription refilled for Adderall (20mg, x2 day), and noticed that the pills were a different color.   <e1> Instead of the usual pink color, I received pills that were peach colored </e1>  .  Looking at the label, I found that  <e2> the manufacturer had switched from CorePharma to AuroBindo </e2>  .  I've been taking the CorePharma manufactured Adderall for the past ~3 years, and I've found that the CorePharma generic has been working really well for me.  However, with midterms and finals coming up, I'm concerned about the differences between my old medication, and my new.  I've read reports, on this sub and other sites, that switching manufacturers have led to problems for some people.  Should I be worried, or am I just overreacting? 
I started an attempt last October	the stress and my illness got to be too much	Because it feels like it's killing me.   <e1> I started an attempt last October </e1>   because  <e2> the stress and my illness got to be too much </e2>  .  I just have invested so much time in this program (almost 2 years this June), but I don't think I can pull myself through another year or even just 8 weeks of rigor.   I just wish I felt like I had a clear idea of what I wanted but I just feel empty and lost.  I wish I knew what would help, if anything.  And if it's even worth it.   Does anyone have any advice for getting through a rigorous grad  MFA program that makes being healthy impossible? Is this just my brain telling me lies? I just don't know what to trust anymore and this decision seems so big and unmanageable.  
Its been a frustrating experience	I exercise regularly (almost every day)	When I first stopped drinking, I lost about 10 pounds over about 3 months.  It felt great.  But since those first few months, I've steadily gained weight.  To the point now that I'm about 15 pounds up from my drinking weight.  A lot of clothes aren't fitting anymore.  <e1>  Its been a frustrating experience </e1> , because  <e2> I exercise regularly (almost every day) </e2> .  I eat pretty healthy, and try to limit my portions.  Where it all goes wrong is I get depressed every few weeks, and spend a few days just loafing around, and I gain back all the weight and more that I lost over the previous weeks.   I have a lot of social anxiety, and socializing has been a lot harder without the crutch of booze.  Gaining weight has made that a lot worse.  I don't really feel like drinking, but I'm sick of feeling like shit, and feeling fat.  
I	that	I just found this sub tonight and have been reading your stories and they all sound like the textbook definition of my exes mom and too a certain extent my ex.   If I would have found this sub back then I might have seen the signs sooner and maybe been able to salvage the relationship.   Just knowing my experience wasn't just a freak thing with a messed up person helps great with the closure.   Thank you for that
i	relatability	i skimmed https:captainawkward. com20121230414-what-are-the-green-flags-for-a-good-therapist and was curious if them being same gendered would be more successful in attaining a connection in terms of relatability 
So	Easter!	So I've basically been in a relationship from like 2013-January of this year (different relationships but they were one after the other).  I ALMOST ended up in another relationship this month and although I like the person and all that jazz, I know I'm not ready and I'd only be using the person to distract me from the things I need to work on.  I was very transparent with him and told him the reasons why I need to keep things casual and just be by myself for a while and he was very understanding.    Currently I have no FP.   It's weird.  But not the end of the world.  Hooray for me.  ^ _ ^ Side note: Mysteryland 2017 just got canceled and I'm preeeeeeetty broken up about it but I'm gonna deal and I'll be okay.   Hope everyone is doing okay and having a happy Easter!
This	noticed.	This is kind of an odd post, but i felt the need too write it for whatever reason.  This last month or two has been especially hard on me, but one thing that i noticed is that my dog has been way more attached too me lately.  I live with my parents and we have an 11 year old great dane which is very old for a dane, but he's still going on.  He doesnt do much other than just lay in my parents room and eat and go outside like two-three times a day.  However these last couple of weeks I've been really sad about certain things, and spending most of my time in my room, and my dog who would not usually come downstairs due too his bad legs will come and want too be petted and will lay down next too me, or if my door is closed he'll either try too open it or lay down right next too it.  I don't really know for a fact that my dog knows that it's been especially rough these last few weeks but it was just an odd coincidence that i noticed.   
What has worked for you guys medication wise that hasn't fogged your brain?	I need some help and support	Hey guys, it's been almost a year I think since I really posted last.  Since then I've gotten engaged, accepted a fellowship at a university to continue my studies for a PhD, rented a house, and am almost done with my undergraduate work.  I'm on Latuda and it's f****** expensive.  Like 550 every month.  Plus my episodes are bad.  Currently depressed/raid cycling.   <e1> What has worked for you guys medication wise that hasn't fogged your brain? </e1>   <e2> I need some help and support </e2> .  I'm suicidal several hours per week and my fiance and I are really struggling.  Thanks :)
I	Fuck	I was just looking at myself in the mirror after a long day of Easter activities.  Looking at my reflection, I could see how I felt; horribly depressed and tired of everything.  And I often find it so ridiculous that I can feel this bad over literally nothing.  It makes me laugh to myself, and say under my breath, Fuck
I can't focus but I know I need to	I need to study	Just had a breakdown because of exams.  I'm in university.  I know I need to study, and I try, but I get so overwhelmed that I start to get anxiety about failing.  Then  <e1> I can't focus but I know I need to </e1>  because  <e2> I need to study </e2> .  It's just a constant cycle.  I don't know how to balance both the required studying I need and my mental health.  Man I don't like school.  
I	terrified.	I am so nervous right now I feel like my heart is going to jump out of my throat.  I know I need to go; I've needed help for a long time, but I just feel completely terrified.  
I	it.	I work in a pretty busy environment.  People always joke around and sometimes act silly.  I still find it difficult for me to open up.  I don't get anxiety like before but, I'm still afraid to speak up and speak my mind.  My heart isn't racing, I'm just closed up.  Even on Xanax, it doesn't help.  I actually get more depressed once it wears off so I stopped taking it. 
I'm so glad	I was able to do it finally	I can't believe that I haven't had a cigarette in over a year.  I don't even think about them any more! It took me years of trying to kick the habit and honestly it took me getting pregnant to stop.   <e1> I'm so glad </e1>  that  <e2> I was able to do it finally </e2> .  If you're reading this, one day your time will come.  You can do this.  
Anyone	you.	Anyone have good suggestions on how to keep cool during an anxiety attack?  I find myself lashing out at loved ones during stressful situations.   I often even find myself embarrassed about how I acted during an anxiety attack.   Any suggestions are welcome.   Thank you. 
This	thoughts.	This is such a one-of-a-kind show about two vigilantes who go around beating up rapists on a college campus.  It's funny, but also heartbreakingly painful to watch sometimes.  I found it really, really real, so much so that I had to pause sometimes just to collect my head for a sec.  I was, though, a little disappointed with what seemed like an attempt to dull down the subject to make it comply with MTV's typical standards (cutesy covers of pop songs, arbitrary romances, cheesy this and that).  It made the show slightly disjointed to me; the rawness of the subject and the accuracy with which they portray it, and the glittery MTV-ness added, seemingly somewhat reluctantly, into storylines and post-production. Did anyone else watch? If so, what did you think? Did it help you heal, etc. ? Would love to hear your thoughts. 
Is	well?	Is it normal to experience extreme fatigue/sluggishness during kratom use, tapering, and discontinuation? Regardless of the stage, the tiredness is debilitating.  Sleep is all I think about and laying down even 2 mins leads to unbearable sleepiness.  This I thought would be expected during initial drawls but it's an everyday thing and occurs even when taking kratom.  I'm wondering if this is caused by the brains chemistry being changed after years of use and a typical effect experience by others in similar situation, or whether this may be separate from kratom/opiate sideeffects and possibly something else at play.  I could literally sleep all day everyday but since I can't do that I go week by week battling sleep and fatigue at every waking hour.  Do others experience this as well?
I	drinking	I didn't make it yesterday.  I was at Easter at my Aunt's and I was already irritable.  My boyfriend and I got in a fight in the car before and I gave in.  He was having a beer, and I started with diet coke and really tried but when it came time to eat the red wine sounded too good.  I had 2 glasses with lunch and we left but I stopped for wine on the way home.  I drank the whole bottle as usual, and nothing bad happened, my boyfriend isn't mad at me, I didn't do anything stupid.  But I do feel like shit of course and just wish I had been strong enough.  I've done it before, I just couldn't do it yesterday.  Coming back here and checked-in today.  It will of course be easy not to drink today, but I'm really hoping to make the week.  Trying not to look ahead too much, but I can't afford to slip up again.  I'm lucky there were no real ramifications, but I can't use that as a sign that I'm ok.  I know what happens after this if I keep drinking
and	free.	and i am a very unmotivated person, so i am worried i will end up homeless and shit.   I am considering just ending the burden of anyone from here on, and flipping my car with my seatbelt off.   I don't see any better way to go.   Maybe then I can actually be free.   
Live	appreciated?	Live in Canada.  3 weeks ago I was arrested for DUI at 3x limit.  I have hired a lawyer to look into situation but I'm preparing for fact of pleading guilty.  No one hurt thank god but I have been away from work the last 3 weeks so depressed and ashamed.  Going back to work today (on the bus) was so hard and I have no idea where my legal case will go for or outcome.  Seeking counselling through a work program and know I have to quit the local bars where I live which is hard as I do it for social living divorced alone.  Any advice appreciated?
Been looking for anything to get high from, except weed	smoking gives me a certain feeling in not proud of	I've been pretty depressed for about a week or so, gotten worse last few days.   <e1> Been looking for anything to get high from, except weed </e1>  because  <e2> smoking gives me a certain feeling in not proud of </e2> , neither do other drugs but I can control other drugs slightly better but with weed I just keep wanting to feel like it again.  Getting pretty difficult , hope it passes, still motivation for anything just isn't there.  Anxiety is mostly gone which is good, well other than social anxiety but general anxiety is pretty much gone I think.  
I	easily	I house sat here two months ago, and they left also left me 2 bottles of wine then.  I drank them both over 2 nights. . .  and more, when I had some friends over to make dinner.  They also have a whole liquor station in the dining room.  Tequila, whiskey, vodka, rum.  For now, I'm good. . .  I don't feel tempted at all (we'll see how that goes once the sun goes down).  A part of me is like, but just one! I can beat that voice down pretty easily
I lost my mother and younger sister to suicide, so I know what it feels like to be a survivor	being completely obsessed with the thought of going through with it myself	Just as the title says, I feel a compulsion toward suicide right now.   I don't necessarily *want* to die; it just feels like something that will happen regardless of whether I want it to.    <e1> I lost my mother and younger sister to suicide, so I know what it feels like to be a survivor </e1> .   This isn't stopping me from  <e2> being completely obsessed with the thought of going through with it myself </e2> .   Over the past couple of days, I've had two different methods on hand and had to absolutely struggle to keep from going through with it.   Even though I bloody well know how difficult the loss would be on those I love.   The voice in my head saying go through with it is starting to get louder than the voice telling me they wouldn't be ok. So that's me in a nutshell, right now.   Suicidal to some extent and afraid I won't be able to stop it happening.   Not a great place to be. 
I'm	possible.	I'm getting to the end of my rope and I no longer really have a will to live.  People tell me to live.  They tell me I should live for loved ones' sake.  They don't tell me how to live.  I'm seeking treatment for my depression but therapy isn't doing much and I'm over a week out from seeing the psychiatrist.  I've been down this road before and I've attempted suicide more than once. . . . and I want to do that. . . but I want to complete and that's one of the few things keeping me alive. . . . I want to be as sure as possible.  
I	it.	I am very very desperate and not in a good spot.  Idk what to do anymore but I am absolutely losing it.  
One	breathing?	One of the first ways they tell you to try to handle anger or rage is usually taking deep breaths, or counting a certain number of breaths, and I've tried this many, many times.  It has never worked for me.  If anything it makes me angrier, more irritable.  Why? Why isn't this simple technique so ineffectual for me? What could I possibly be doing wrong with breathing?
I've	Help.	I've got to go to work today.  I'm doing some weird anxiety cough cough - gag thing (without actually throwing up) I've been doing it for two days.  Does anyone else have this? I keep having fleeting thoughts of suicide but just fleeting.  However I know I'm really struggling and it's upsetting me to know I'm upset (does this make sense).  The holidays have been troubling.  My childhood best friend died, I went to his funeral on weds.  My wife has again rejected me (she left me in January).  Things had been getting better, but she blew cold and I asked her where I stood - she erupted on me.  So I'm back with very raw emotion.  Abandoned.  Feel like I've a crabapple where my gut used to be.  Rocking in bed, weird cough-gag thing.  Have to somehow scrape my exhausted shit together to go to work.  Help. 
I've	breath?	I've only had a panic disorder for six months.  It hit me like a brick and has been persistent ever since.  It started when I was smoking weed but I've since stopped.  The only medication I've regularly taken for it Beta Blockers (atenolol about 0. 08mg a day [taking more than that makes me dizzy as shit and I can't afford to go back to the doctor]) prescribed by an urgent care doctor after having a week long attack.  I have some xanax that was given to me by a family member and I've never taken it before.  What should I expect? I intend on only taking 0. 06mg tonight.  Right now I'm experiencing mild anxious thoughts and bad shortness of breath (but I also have some sort of throat bug so maybe it's related.  I've had shortness of breath without being sick a shit ton of times though).  Will the xanax stop the shortness of breath?
perhaps	scary.	perhaps tomorrow, maybe in a year or a decade, I'll be taking my last breath of oxygen before my body completely shuts down, therefore shutting down my consciousness for enternity.  I cannot wrap my head around the concept of death, and I cannot accept the terrifying fact that nobody knows what's going to happen.  Nobody definitely knows that we simply cease to exist, nor that there is an afterlife.  There's an unlimited number of possibilities.  It's very scary. 
Went	issues	Went to a therapist for a few months before I lost insurance, they didn't prescribe medicine.  Now they I got insurance back, I really just want something to let me enjoy my life.  I'm afraid I'll see a doctor who won't believe me or doesn't believe in medicine for mental issues
Schizo-affective	reign.	Schizo-affective bipolar, everything should be fine because life is looking good, but some extra work stress has triggered mild hallucinations and a deluge of suicidal alien thoughts.  I don't know who to turn to, I can't go back to the mental health services.  My family and my girlfriend can't find out about this either.  I am stuck with these thoughts screaming into my skull.  Is there anybody left to turn to? I am ready to give up and give the thoughts free reign.  
she told me that she wants to take some time apart	She feels that she should take some time apart from me to learn to be happier and deal with this on her own	My girlfriend suffers from depression but currently doesn't take any medication or otherwise for it.  She does not see a therapist either.  However, I have been depressed before and I somewhat understand what she is feeling.  I want to be supportive.  I know that she loves me and I love her.  But last night  <e1> she told me that she wants to take some time apart </e1> .   <e2> She feels that she should take some time apart from me to learn to be happier and deal with this on her own </e2> .  She doesn't want to have to rely on others to be happy.  I understand that.  But based on my understanding of depression, I am not sure that you can just learn to get over it very easily.  I am worried about her and want to support her.  She isn't suicidal or in severe danger.  What do you recommend that I do
pfff.	.	pfff.  my mind is a blur and this sadness has overwhelmed me.  i plan to stop therapy and just sit and wither away. but if someone was to give me a little purpose or energy, i would be grateful. . . 
I've	past	I've been suicidal for 30+ years - that whole, it gets better or it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem just doesn't ring true.   I've tried twice in the past
I don't want to get weed	I don't want to make my emotions weirder	I feel so angry and sad and fucked.  Been depressed for two years so I'm used to it but this feels a bit different.   <e1> I don't want to get weed </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want to make my emotions weirder </e2> . I might go for a skate and just fuck everything lol Ugh I missed a college interview today and God I was in hysterics while arguing to my mum.  Literally laughing and crying.  I need to smash shit up or something
Saving	lol.	Saving money so I decided to spend it on a fuckin tree.  I'm down to half days at outpatient so gotta figure out what to do with the rest of my time until I go back to work.  I don't have any trees or shade in my backyard so hopefully in a few years this 8 foot tree will start giving some nice shade.  No one ever said sobriety was gonna be a really fun time but the small things help lol. 
It	.	It would take way to long to explain my situation and im sure no one really cares anyway.  I just dont understand how i can be so afraid  of death, but constantly feel like i want to shoot myself in the head.  I dont understand how thinking about dying makes me sick with fear, but ive also attempted suicide 3 times.  I just want to die right now, but i know im afraid of it as well. . 
Today	soon	Today is day 5.  I'm back at work today and so far so good.  Feel very weak and lethargic but not too bad overall.  Got some sleep last night so I think that made a big difference.  Some slight anxiety when dealing with people but I don't think anyone notices or cares.  This is the first time I ever worked a sober day here since I started two years ago.  It feels like the first day on a new job when you're not buzzed on Kratom lol Anyways I Had half a beer before bed last night to help relax and get some sleep. .  I'm gonna try not to make a habit of it though.  I was just desperate and felt like I needed something to take the edge off.  Thanks for all the support and have a great day :) I'll post something again soon
Hi	:(	Hi friends.  So I've been in therapy for about three years now and am actually pretty happy with how much better I have gotten in comparison to the person I was about 6 years ago.  My therapist and I are finally really digging into why I have borderline and my subconscious is fighting, and hard.  I keep having random flashbacks to things that weren't upsetting or traumatizing (like sitting in 5th grade art class), but I feel like I'm that age again and that I will be stuck in this feeling.  It's hard to explain without being long winded, but this is new to me, and really scary.  I can tell how difficult going through these memories that bring me so much shame is going to be.  I'm terrified that it will only cause me pain to talk about them and not give me relief or closure.  :( 
On	please!!	On day 20 I think, just recently  noticed that I really think I have some depressive symptoms and I get angry really easy.  Last few days all I want to do is sleep.  Has anyone noticed this during their quit?  I've never read anything about depression associated with quitting smoking.  I can understand the anger, could be associated to the anxiety of quitting.  A friend even noticed that im shaking too which I had noticed in the past 3 days.  Comments/suggestions please!! 
i was really sad	i felt like i was running out of time	Last week i turned 19 years old, while most of the people around me seemed happy,  <e1> i was really sad </e1>  because  <e2> i felt like i was running out of time </e2> , even though i have no goals, emotionally dull most of the time, no reason to get out of bed.  Deep down i feel like i do not deserve to be happy and people have no reason to like me, as if i am not worthy of affection. 
I am not worried about convincing doc I have it	I know I have it	I am 19 and tomorrow after class I am going to my doctors office to get checked out.  I am going to bring up how I have been dealing with the symptoms of ADHD for as long as i can remember.   <e1> I am not worried about convincing doc I have it </e1> , because  <e2> I know I have it </e2> .  I'm more worried that he will send me to a psychiatrist or psychologist or whatever and my insurance won't pay for it and then I'm just screwed.  Very anxious feeling.  I worry that I will be forced to just deal with how I am and not get it treated.  I had a friend (no longer friends- drifted away) who was on vyvanse and I tried one once and it helped me in every area.  Do you guys have any tips for the first visit? (Obviously I'm not just gonna barge in there asking for vyvanse but it would be best case scenario for me) 
I asked a friend where a girl, i knew from earlier	i remembered her from school	Hey Reddit.  Since two weeks I'm thinking about continue living being worth it. Let me tell you the story that made me think about it. I'm around the early 20s.  I haven't been partying for months, just sat at home playing computer, after someday i decided to go party with some friends again.  I was a bit nervous, because I didn't have much contact to nearly all my friends while I was gaming.  We then went to the party and it was fun and nice.  I really enjoyed it.   <e1> I asked a friend where a girl, i knew from earlier </e1> , was, because  <e2> i remembered her from school </e2> .  But she wasn't here.  The next thing i heard freaking shocked me.  My friend said: Wait what? You didn't hear of her having an Ski-Accident?.  Me: No?.  He told me everything he knew.  She was standing around with her snowboard
I	choose.	I don't know if this entirely belongs here, but I've been suffering from PTSD for a while and this thread is just where I feel most comfortable posting this.  I'm not sure if this is exactly PTSD-related, but. . . Last night I was absolutely adamant that the friend I was talking to had committed suicide a few months back and I was just talking to an imaginary friend.  I was just so confused and terrified.  I felt betrayed in a way if that even makes sense.   Now, I'm pretty close with this friend so I just straight up asked him if he was even real.  He was supportive, but I still feel like such a nuisance.  I'd been hyperventilating and I just felt dizzy from it, so I ended up falling into a nightmare-riddled sleep.  I haven't heard from him since though, so this makes me feel so awkward. I'm still kind of questioning whether he's real while typing this, to be completely honest.  I just had to get this off my chest and this felt like one of the more supportive subreddits to choose. 
Hey	all!	Hey all,I am beginning to recognize how my low self esteem is negatively manifesting itself in my life and my sponsor told me to trust the process in the steps and be patient but I am looking for any tips or suggestions on how to improve my self esteem.  I have some time and am wanting to explore more options or tangible exercises or things I can proactively do.  Thank you all!
I'm anxious	I worked myself into a panic attack	I woke up overheating, and now  <e1> I'm anxious </e1>  because  <e2> I worked myself into a panic attack </e2> .  I'm so mad.  I'm so over this.  
Hey	like.	Hey everyone, I've been extremely worried and can't find anything about this symptom I have online.  Sometimes when I am trying to work on something at my job or at home and I get distracted by someone or something, my body freezes up for a second and I feel like I can't move.  (There is no warning to it except for me panicking all day recently.  No lightheadedness or pain)Then everything goes back to normal and I feel okay until it happens again.  It happens in bursts and happens more frequently when I actively think about it.  It's almost like a sensory overload or something.  My therapist seemed confused by it, that's why I'm asking if anyone has experienced something similar before.  It kind of feels like being on the verge of fainting, but I've never fainted, so this is just what I imagine it would feel like.  
but	feel	but not overconfident in the least.  Just need to keep up the good habits and use the support of this group to push through.  7 days is going to be a significant milestone I feel
I find it so hard to believe that a guy would really like me	I find myself so unappealing and hard to love	Social anxiety makes me isolate myself so it's almost impossible for me to meet new people.   I crave having a deep connection with someone and I crave affection.  I've resorted to online dating but it's hard for me to bring myself to meet guys because I assume they're not gonna like me and I won't be good enough for them.  I feel like I'm too awkward and shy in person.  I worry too much if I will embarrass myself so I just don't go through with meeting them and then that destroys any chance I had with them.   <e1> I find it so hard to believe that a guy would really like me </e1>  because  <e2> I find myself so unappealing and hard to love </e2> . 
I	trauma	I was so nervous to start medical treatment for my PTSD that I've been struggling with for 6 years.  But it got to the point that not going just wasn't an option anymore. I went on Psychology Today and literally typed in my area and PTSD psychiatrists.  I read through the reviews and picked one that specializes in trauma
There have been a good number of times that doctors let me down	I went over a year without a sinus infection being noticed and treated, 2 years of severe nausea so bad at times that couldn't hold down a meal without smoking pot first, and two years without getting medicine for migraines	 <e1> There have been a good number of times that doctors let me down </e1> .  It's as if when I'm having an episode, no other medical problems matter to them.  It's in one ear and out the other.  It's because of this that  <e2> I went over a year without a sinus infection being noticed and treated, 2 years of severe nausea so bad at times that couldn't hold down a meal without smoking pot first, and two years without getting medicine for migraines </e2> . When I mentioned my nausea, headaches, and the pressure behind my nose I would be told it was probably just the schizophrenia making me feel those things.  Or tha t the schizophrenia was just making me hyper aware of small symptoms that don't really matter.  Finally though I found the right doctor that actually listened to me and didnt just see me as a freak and got those things taken care of. Is this a common problem for people with Scizophrenia?
I'm	Thanks	I'm 33 and have lived with depression anxiety my hole life but rarely have anxiety attacks.  Over the last 2 weeks I keep getting panic attacks out of the blue.  I literally feel like I'm going to die.  I thought I was having a heart attack and went to E. R.  the first time.   Every day I tell my self things are probably going to be back to normal and no need to go to the doctor and whiteout fail it happens again. . .  Nothing in my personal has changed to cause this.  Could it be health related? Obviously I'm making a apt to go to my PCP but in the meantime I'm curious what you all have to say  Thanks
I'm	ass.	I'm 23, on the autism spectrum, and I've been planning on killing myself since I was 11.  The longer I live the more I learn about how fucked my future is.  Doesn't matter how well-connected or successful my family and friend(s) are, nobody wants to hire me for anything that puts a roof over my head.  I hate people, I hate social interaction.  I know I'm terrible at it and I just want to be left alone.  People hold all the keys to happiness and I'm an outcast.  My depression is a symptom of all my problems, not a chemical imbalance or skewed way of thinking.  I feel like a fucking alien whose human parents grow increasingly worried and unwelcoming.  Currently the only place in the world I feel okay is in my bedroom and I'm lucky to have that.  Nitrogen asphyxiation sounds peaceful.  I'm trying to last the next 3 years for my siblings to graduate college but it's getting difficult.  Shrink told me to reach out to people first, probably just to cover his ass. 
I	health.	I have pretty bad anger issues.  I lash out on everything, and break stuff occasionally. . . However, recently I've been getting so angry I get extremely bad headaches and my heart starts to hurt.  I can hear my heartbeat in my ears and can't think about anything but how angry I am.  I won't be able to sit still and sometimes I even tear up. This happens often. Does this actually effect my health. 
I got an intense headache when I woke up	It throbbed when I got up but not when I walked around the pressure was intense	I woke up this morning after I stopped worrying about symptoms the previous evening,  <e1> I got an intense headache when I woke up </e1> , for no apparent reason.   <e2> It throbbed when I got up but not when I walked around the pressure was intense </e2> .  I had got these headaches three weeks prior (ironically when I stopped worrying about other symptoms).  So I took two pills and it eased off, I am scared it will return in the morning.  Also I have had spasms in my face which have essentially gone in the past week, which I am putting down to anxiety, It also feels like my neck is tight and my back muscles feel like they release pressure when I lay down. Ideas?
TL;DR:	here	TL;DR: Ferretface26 one year ago: miserable, depressed and drunk.  Ferretface26 today: sober, happy and hopeful.  Big thanks to AA for making it possible. A year ago I woke up with one single thought in my head: I can't do this anymore.  Not I won't or I don't want to or I shouldn't; I *can't* do this anymore.  The blackouts, the hangovers, the guilt, shame and remorse, the hiding and the lying and just all the general bullshit that goes along with being an active alcoholic.  On the outside I had a decent life: mid-twenties, career, city apartment, living the dream.  Underneath I was lonely, depressed, isolated, anxious, and tired.  I wasn't actively suicidal but my thoughts ran in that direction more often than not, and I was tired of life.  I felt cheated, like I'd worked hard to make it and be an adult and now that I was here
So	helpful.	So I've been dizzy and feeling nauseous off and on for a few months.   I thought I might've been pregnant for two of them but conclusive evidence says no. I've been getting headaches sometimes.   Last two days and today I've had this feeling like my skin's crawling and have been crazy dizzy. Could this all be related to Ritalin?  I've taken 30mg/day for over a year and had no issues before (only occasional headaches).  I'm trying to figure out if I should try and get my psychiatrist to fit me in ASAP or if I should take myself down to the GP's office tomorrow, so any advice one way or the other would be helpful. 
he said would talk to my doctor about getting me on strattera and a lower dose of some amphetamine based drug	I'm already fairly skinny with a low appetite	Recently, I went to a psychologist (or maybe psychiatrist I don't remember) to see if I had ADHD.  As it turns out, I do.  I don't have a prescription yet but  <e1> he said would talk to my doctor about getting me on strattera and a lower dose of some amphetamine based drug </e1>  because  <e2> I'm already fairly skinny with a low appetite </e2> .  Anybody have a similar prescription, and if so, what have your results been so far? 
No	otherwise.	No one is you're friend, your being used on way or another. Whenever someone achieves something, it means someone else has failed.  People love to put others down and don't care at all about anyone apart from themselves.  These are just a few examples, please try to convince me otherwise.  
I	now	I was diagnosed my last semester of college through the schools psychiatrist and getting prescriptions through him.  Due to some with issues not knowing if I'd have insurance or not, I did not transfer my case over to anyone new when I graduated and stopped getting prescriptions and seeing anyone.  I now have insurance again almost a year later. I have been off medication since I graduated, some days when it's really bad I take some of the left over ritalin from my old prescriptions (I would always forget to take it and still have a bit left), but it makes me very anxious when it starts to wear off.  Lately it seems like all of the days are now in the really bad ADHD category.  I can't focus or do anything.  I'm incredibly late to work every day and I don't care.  Things I want to care about and accomplish I just don't care about. I know I need help and I can get help again now
.	with).	. . .  and I'm sharing it in case it corresponds to how your brain does and that's helpful. I have as many things in my brain as everyone else, but my brain has no walls inside to keep things properly separated and tidy.    For this reason, I struggle with recalling information, distinguishing certain ideas, focusing on a single thing keeping others at bay, (insert a thousand other things I struggle with). 
It	appreciated	It feels odd to even post this knowing that someone may read this.  I have been at a low point in my life for as long as I can remember but what I can't remember is suicide ever being an everyday part of my life like it is now.  I have a supportive mother and partner but I don't have the balls to talk to my mother too in depth about anything and I feel that the hate I have for myself is making me fall out of love and somewhat resenting my partner.  Other than them, I really don't feel like I have anybody.  I don't want to shock or scare myself into giving up on treatment sooner than I should and I truly panic when seeking help which is why I've never done it so I'm looking for ways others have rehabilitated by easing into treatment and what what sort of treatments you accepted.  Everything is appreciated
I	MAN.	I have had it with this smoking shit.  What the fuck is wrong with me.  I used to be such a nice person.  I was clean.  And now I am this filthy beast of a smoker.  I need to get rid of this shit.  It is a pointless act I do multiple times everyday.  What is this madness.  That is it.  I will stop this right now.  My brain, register this act right here.  You are never going to compel me to smoke.  Never going to give me the urge to smoke.  You are immense in your power.  So do what you do best and fucking help me.  Help me quit this smoking.  I am starting a new life right now.  One which does not have smoking in it.  One which is cleaner.  One where I don't have yellow nail beds.  One where I don't die a miserable looser.  I am going to be a fabulous winner.  I will conquer myself.  I will conquer my life.  As of now.  I AM A BETTER MAN.  
I	words.	I had a rough therapy session earlier, and then I had to go straight to work afterwards.  I've been riding on the edge of panic all day, but finally had the chance to take some meds on my lunch.  I honestly don't know why I'm writing this.  I've written here tons of times, but i guess just now I feel overwhelmed and a little discouraged.  I feel like even though I've got tons of coping skills, I'm just gonna end up going crazy or something.  I've only got 3 hours left at work, so I made it over half way.  But life just seems like too much.  Too much stimulus, too much noise, too many feelings, too many responsibilities, too much of everything.  How do you feel hopeful when whenever you make progress, you take two steps back?Edit:  Guys, I literally cried happy tears when I read all of your comments.  This community is so supportive, and it makes me feel comforted and happy to know there are other people like me who have been through what I'm going through.  Thank you all for your kind words. 
I love someone who doesn't love me	it also hurts to be his friend	 <e1> I love someone who doesn't love me </e1> .  We're not friends anymore, and it hurts.  But, <e2>  it also hurts to be his friend </e2> .  It hurts more to be his friend.  I'm going to miss him, but I miss my life more.  I wish things could've been different, but they just can't be and it hurts.  I've been crying for days.  I went to a party last night and after a few hours I just couldn't stop crying.  I'm heart broken.  :( I hate this pain in my chest.  Love doesn't hurt.  Love feels good.  Being kicked down and around hurts.  Not feeling love reciprocated hurts.  I handled the whole thing really well, but I just want the pain to end already.  I'm excited for when it's gone completely :(
I'm in their lives	they need me there for some reason to them, but that could change at any time	People can only do so much.  My family and friends love me dearly and are very concerned, but they have lives of their own to live.  My depression has been a huge burden to everyone.  My existence is a burden to those same people.  I've also come to realize that at the end of the day, I'm only a function to their lives.   <e1> I'm in their lives </e1>  because  <e2> they need me there for some reason to them, but that could change at any time </e2> .  I only have two friends and they have a lot going for them, I don't wish to burden them anymore than I already have.  My parents work hard and just want to live a happy and easy life.  I'm a parasite, clinging to them like a child still, even though I'm well off to adulthood.  This isn't a sad story.  I just want to free myself, and free everyone else.  It will hurt at first, but they will move on with their lives and I will be a memory.  I think that's fine. 
I	14	I am. . .  discouraged and disappointed with myself.  As can be expected.  Too much too fast.  I tried quitting cigarettes and weed cold turkey.  I was emboldened by quitting alcohol several months ago successfully, thinking I've got this. I became extremely angry around hour 14
My	abuse	My dad is difficult.   I love some things about him, but hate others.   He messed up my childhood by always needing to make things about him, and when they weren't, he belittled me and my brother. He has gone through a lot, including nursing his last girlfriend through her cancer death, but most of my life his communications have been about either Look what a great thing I'm doing! or Look how much life treats me badly!  There was always a lot of alcohol abuse
I had misplaced my previous one and I was seeing a doctor that I hadn't seen before	at my local medical centre it is sometimes faster just to see the next available	Tried to get my prescription today.   <e1> I had misplaced my previous one and I was seeing a doctor that I hadn't seen before </e1>  because  <e2> at my local medical centre it is sometimes faster just to see the next available </e2> .  He had all my details and my file open showing that I have been going to that place for years, but everything was a battle. Doctor: So, apart from all the pain and fatigue from another condition, recently losing your job, and struggling with PTSD, what other reason do you have for being depressed?Me: Having to explain myself to you would probably top my list right now. It was upsetting at the time, but now I just have to laugh at it.  I hadn't been questioned so much in a while. 
Hi	here.	Hi all,I've toyed with the idea of cutting back my pot consumption a LOT  over the last couple weeks.  I'm in a pretty bad place physically and mentally; I can still hold down a job but outside of that it's pretty much sleep until 2-3pm, smoke (alone or with people), throw on some work clothes, work until 12am, stay up until 5am heavily smoking alone in my room, repeat.  And honestly, I've tried blaming everything EXCEPT for weed. Just woke up with a half-smoked bowl next to me and I know if I hit it I'll go right back to sleep and wake up at 2pm and continue this godforsaken cycle that is making me neglect all chances of enriching my life.  But I still want to, and I don't think that's a good sign. I'm going to leave this bowl on the floor and go about my day, so I guess this is day 1.  Even writing this post out felt really cathartic, so I thank anyone who read it through and I welcome any support/similar stories/advice.  Thank you guys for even just being here.  
It's coming to the point where I want to try Adderall to see if it will help me	my friend has had success with it	Pretty much what happens when I try to talk to a girl who's attractive.  It's killing me.  I've been trying to fix the problem for years and I've even started going to the gym and talking more and still nothing has changed.  I think about talking to a certain girl in my head and then when the time comes and I'm ready to go over to her and talk to her, my face goes completely red and I feel like all the blood has rushed to my head and my brain just freezes and I'm unable to think of anything to actually say in a conversation.   <e1> It's coming to the point where I want to try Adderall to see if it will help me </e1>  because  <e2> my friend has had success with it </e2> .  Any suggestions? 
From	me.	From the months I have been planning, it has come to this.  My Prom is tomorrow and I will act like everything is ok and wander off to somewhere out of town and hopefully away from any other towns nearby, I won't nobody to find my remains, the only suicide note I will leave will be in pieces around my town but as I know they will be ignored, no doubt I will posted on the missing persons registry.  I have been smart enough to cover everything, I'm doing so people don't have to know of my sad demise, I pray no one has to know about what happens to me.  I thank you all for trying but I end here.  If I am found I wish to remain John Doe, I have planned for this for nearly a year.  Good bye world which never has an interest in me.  
I have fear of abandonment but I never voice them, I just assume everyone will leave	I have zero self esteem, but I don't bother trying to stop it, it's more like it's something I've accepted as fact so I just enjoy people while I have them	Hi, I was diagnosed with BPD recently but I don't have relationship difficulties at all.   <e1> I have fear of abandonment but I never voice them, I just assume everyone will leave </e1>  because  <e2> I have zero self esteem, but I don't bother trying to stop it, it's more like it's something I've accepted as fact so I just enjoy people while I have them </e2> .  Although my friends have never left so it's just an insecurity I guess.   I don't split, even on myself, I hate myself all the time and am only abusive toward myself.  I have great healthy friendships and a steady relationship with my boyfriend.  Anyone else similar?
Is	here.	Is it just me, or are people becoming less intelligent as time goes on? Does anyone even care about anything anymore? Fuck it, if you don't care, I don't care.  I'm at a point where my life is so empty and meaningless. . i've been depressed my entire life. . . it's just getting worse and worse. .  fuck this shit.  Life is so stupid.  My life has been an absolute train wreck.  I'm peacing out from society.  Everyone can end up killing each other , i'm out of here. 
I	crying.	I read stories about people, with a stranger that goes up and talk to them, or someone who sees a person in a bad situation with a abuser in public.  When my SO drops my books in front of my feet on the ground in the middle of a busy college campus, no one helps me.  When I am getting talked to like I'm a dog, or some bitch, loudly in a library, no one says anything, they just stare and look away.  When I'm crying in a booth at a cafeteria, and someone says hi to me, then notices I'm crying, they just turn away.  No matter what, no one will ever fucking understand.  I mean, I don't think I'm being so egotistical to just want someone to see I'm sad and try to help.  It's so annoying that no one cares.  Do you get me? Does anyone else feel like they are depressed, but no one really gives a flying fuck, and just pretend that you're not there?You people win.  Some kindness from anyone would probably make things so different, but no one cares if I'm the one who is crying.  
I	attention	I used to think people who cut themselves and justified it with I just want to feel ~something~ were trying to be edgy or gain attention
So	result.	So after months of therapy and years of severe social anxiety and some generalized anxiety, I finally decided to see a psychiatrist and have been taking Zoloft for a week now.  I know that it takes time for medication like that to start having an effect, but my biggest fear is taking medication and finding that it doesn't change anything.  Does anyone else have this same fear? I am constantly thinking that my life will be forever ruined if this medication thing doesn't work out and that I will never be happy as a result. 
We've	mother	We've been together almost 7 years.  I've believed he was he one since our third date.  So much has happened in our time together.  He's the only dad my 8 year old son knows.  He and I have a gorgeous tyrant of a 2 year old daughter.  Two months ago he tore me limb from limb when he told me he was going to care for his suicidal mother
Seriously	.	Seriously concerned I'm going to commit suicide one day.  I've tried multiple medications, ssri's, snri's, maois, nothing works for me.  If I didn't have family I would'e done it by now, but i'm too pusssy, my rents are still breathing.  There's literally no reason I shouldn't hang myself right now.  Even if i discovered the cure for cancer there's not reason I should keep living.  It doesn't matter, or make a difference in the grande scheme of things. . .  I've had this mindset since roughly 10 years old and im almost 21 now. . .  Shit gets better, but not for all. . . . 
I'm	body.	I'm a really fucking introverted guy.  I spend pretty much all my time on my computer just doing shit but just last week, my friend invited me to go a mall with his friends after school.  I accepted and went in with a 'fuck it' mindset. At first, his female friends thought that I was weird and I went home feeling pretty down.  However, the next time I went, I tried cracking a few jokes and they instantly warmed up to me. Soon, we went to a Water Park and I met this nice girl and I set up a movie date with her this week. I feel so fucking awesome on this cause I've always struggled with being anxious in social situations and being self conscious about my body. 
R/Anxiety,	it	R/Anxiety, I need your help once more. My dream job has an opening.  I've worked for this lab before in graduate school and I can't begin to tell you how happy it made me.  The work I was doing was EXACTLY what I want to do for the rest of my life.  I felt so happy and complete. Well, I applied for this job a few years ago when they had an opening. . . and did not get it.  I was crushed.  No word on why I didn't get it.  Just Another candidate was more qualified.  It's open once more and I am freaking out.  I'm going to apply for it but I'm afraid I won't get it.  I've taken some steps.  I'm meeting with the lab director in two weeks.  I'm brushing up on my resume and cover letter. Every time I think about applying for it
Hi	:)	Hi all,Today is my 111th day of sobriety.  Since quitting on New Year's Day, I've lost fat, gained muscle, and found my sense of calm again.  Wasn't easy at the beginning, but I'm incredibly grateful to be here and sober.  It's been a while since I checked in, so I'm hoping some of my fellow New Years' day cohort are still around :)
SO	pass	SO proud of myself! I felt some lightheadedness and derealization at times but told myself: This too will pass
What	today.	What makes you guys happy when you're this sad?. I'm so sad today I keep crying. I'm so sad. I don't want to leave my own bed.  I'm just.  Tired.  I don't want to disturb the universe today. 
I	skin	I want to unwravel and dissipate into the empty space once held together by my aching skin 
I'm	that.	I'm usually calm and maintain a front of passive indifference, but today I nearly freaked out.  After a stressful morning I stopped at my usual coffee shop before work.  It being a weekend in a city the place was kind of busy.  A rather short girl got in line behind me and stood basically underneath me.  I did my best to just act calm but within the 5 min I was in the line, my hands were shaking and I felt like running.  That 5 min by itself threw my whole mind somewhere else for the day.  I was a mess just rushing through everything in the hope that it would distract me from feeling like crying.  I eventually got to do some stock work alone with music and was able to gain enough composure to make it home.  I have done some things to detach but I'm honestly afraid to go back there.  I've been cruising along fine for so long, idk how to aproach this. This is more venting than anything else, but idk what to do.  I mean I just noticed my jaw is clenched and I don't even know how long it's been like that. 
I'm	myself.	I'm worthless, lost, depressed and suicidal.  I'm planning on ending my life at the end of this weekend.  I just can't live with the pain anymore, I'm hopeless.  I lay in bed a lot more now, I'm mostly always miserable and depressed and I'm done with all of it.  I suck at school, I'm a burden to my family, I'm depressed and miserable, I haven't felt happiness in months, I've been depressed for months, everybody around me is happy and enjoying life and then there is me.  I can't remember the last time I was happy.  Looking back now I can see my very early stages of my depression.  I answered everything with suicide but I knew I would never do it, and fast forward sometime and I'm sure I will kill myself. 
I	cardio?	I came home from work at 5:30 Thursday, and then I worked out for an hour.  I sat down to dinner.   Then from 7:30-11:30pm I sat down grading papers--im a teacher.  I didn't get a single paper graded in those 4 hours.  How the f@# ! do I learn how to become productive?  I'm struggling to be effective as a human!  I'm sorry to just come out with something so negative guys, but I'm so desperate.  How do I become a powerful and productive person?  I lifted at the gym for 6 days in a row this week, but maybe I need to do more cardio?
I've	goodbye	I've decided to end it all on my 20th birthday.  I realised that I'm ugly for this world.  I'm 19 and never had a girlfriend which speaks volumes.  I was rejected by over 10 women.  I'm short (178cm), have a round face, non masculine jaw and no experience whatsoever.  I know that it is selfish as fuck but I can barely function in society anymore, without feeling depressed when I see people getting into relationships, etc.  goodbye 
Im	alone	Im 13 years old and except for school i never go outside i usually spend the whole day on the computer just watching videos on youtube and stuff but at the end of the day i get depressed and feel like i'm wasting my life.  I have friends but i also have severe social anxiety and i always feel as if my friends are just putting up with me.  I feel depressed and lonely.  I never spend time with friends and when i do i feel as if they don't want to hang out with me as we never do anything pls reply if i'm not alone   
So,	day?	So, I've been dealing with PTSD for almost five years, but recently I've been developing some serious depression symptoms.  I'm currently taking generic lexapro, so it's a little perplexing to me that I'm depressed all of a sudden.  I've read that a person with PTSD is 5 times more likely to also have depression, so I'm wondering if anyone else is also dealing with this.  How do you cope? How do you get out of bed? How do you not sit in parking lots and cry all day? 
I	you	I read a research paper on kundalini yoga ,but I am bit suspicious about it.  Did anyone tried it?Thank you
I feel like such a loser	for nearly 5 years now I've been attempting to teach myself computer programming but I keep failing tremendously even with other people trying to help then getting frustrated with me so i've decided to give up	I'm 24 and I don't have one single thing I like about myself.  I find it unbearable to be around any more.  I am fat, disgusting looking with an even more disgusting personality.  I've got no friends, no motivation, no skills, no hobbies and even my family don't care about me.  <e1> I feel like such a loser </e1>  because  <e2> for nearly 5 years now I've been attempting to teach myself computer programming but I keep failing tremendously even with other people trying to help then getting frustrated with me so i've decided to give up </e2> . Never had any sort of relationship with a girl and I mean it's pretty obvious why anyway I have no personality I look disgusting and I am disgusting in every way.  Also gave up with this. Simply put nobody gives a fuck about me anymore including myself. Tomorrow is my last day.  I'm going to jump from a very tall bridge onto a free way with oncoming cars to ensure I do not live. 
I am afraid to find a job	confronting people	I am afraid of what I look like.  I have social anxiety but never talked to anyone about it.   <e1> I am afraid to find a job </e1> , because of  <e2> confronting people </e2> .  I don't sport because I'm afraid of what people will say about me.  I had this problem for years now and want to lose it.  I need help. I want to join a gym, get a job and do something. 
I	bad	I know I shouldn't worry about girls.  I dont try to.  I dont try to prioritize it.  But I'm so lonely holy shit it hurts so much.  Just seeing a cute girl makes me feel so sad and hopeless every time.  I've never had a gf.  I'm so alone I dont want to be alone and I'm missing out on so much I'm so alone it hurts.  Also I've used tinder for 4 years and have NEVER got a date from it.  Ever.  God it hurts so bad
The longer I'm in therapy, the more frustrated I get	it really isn't helping at all	I hardly ever get sad but I just feel so empty.  I have no motivation to do anything, I'm finding it hard to connect with people, focus at work and in class, get excited at the things I used to, and just feel alive in general.  And it's so frustrating trying to explain this to my therapist who just thinks that I'm in a rut.  Like, no dude.  This has been going on for like four years now and I didn't have time to make a rut, let alone get stuck in one during that time.   <e1> The longer I'm in therapy, the more frustrated I get </e1>  because  <e2> it really isn't helping at all </e2> .  Maybe I need a psychiatrist instead. EDIT: I woke up today with 12 messages in my inbox and was kind of blown away at the empathy and support.  You guys rock.  Also should've specified that I've been feeling this way for four years, but have not been in counseling for that long.  Only been in counseling for like a month and a half.  
I'm	done.	I'm just proud to have gone 2 weeks without smoking.  I've noticed that I have turned posting into a habit.  Whether it's just acknowledging my own success or encouraging others, I really enjoying being smoke free and sharing with everyone.  Hats off to you all for taking the step to free yourself, as I have done.  
Someone	time.	Someone was asking what kind of jobs they could get in order to play a particular game at work. . .  To think I used to base entire weekends around a specific in game event, even missed social events for it.  So glad I've left that behind now and can live my life how I want- not in a way to maximise game time. 
I've	affects.	I've recently went back on meds and going through the mess of finding the right one and dosages etc and I am wondering how people deal with the more negative side affects while working? So far it's not been too bad as I requested to start as slow as possible but I get the odd wave of extreme nausea and finding myself having to lie down in a secluded bit of the office or having to go outside for 20mins until it passes.  It's not a big deal for my office but still makes me want to put in place some measures for future possible side affects. 
How	doing?	How do you help someone you love with PTSD? My bf served 4 years in the Army and the other night he saw one of the people he had to kill in the war.  Although I try to give him words of encouragement and he sees a therapist weekly I feel like should be doing more.  Is there certain things I should stay away from saying that may seem like words of encouragement but it actually makes it worse? Is there anything more I should be doing? 
My	.	My girlfriend flew in on Wednesday for vacation and my anxiety lessened considerably but now, knowing she leaves tomorrow, I'm a mess again.  I'm afraid of the effects her returning to Utah might have on me: I'm still getting used to PA, I still have no friends, I'm alone (which is the biggest source of anxiety), and I'm afraid of what little progress I've made being reset by this visit.  I'm trying to keep calm and not spiral but I don't like being alone, at all.  Please help. . . 
I'm not entirely sure what changed	I remembered some more memories that I had repressed when I woke up from a nap yesterday afternoon.  I told my husband about what I remembered.  Suddenly, a sense of calm and peace washed over me	 <e1> I'm not entirely sure what changed </e1> .   <e2> I remembered some more memories that I had repressed when I woke up from a nap yesterday afternoon.  I told my husband about what I remembered.  Suddenly, a sense of calm and peace washed over me </e2> .  The guilt, the shame, the anger, everything was gone.  I wish I could tell you what finally triggered it, but I really don't know.  I wish you all the best and pray that each and every one of you will find your peace.  Take care and God bless.  
Hi	x	Hi all, I'm a 41 year old binge drinker - mum to 3 gorgeous children.  The days when I am hungover are more frequent than when I'm not ; I'm always shocked at how nice it is to be normal.  I look at other mums at the school gates in the morning - I wonder if any of them feel as shit as me.  And it's getting worse - I am ignoring invites out to drink home alone, I'm bored without a drink, I made tit of myself when I did go out to the local pub and drunk so much.  It just has to stop. Looking forward to getting to know you all. Z. x
I	luck.	I really really should be getting on with my work.  But I feel so anxious and jittery that I can't start.  The more I procrastinate, the more difficult it becomes.  I'm going to tell myself to step out of my anxiety now, and get working.  It doesn't matter that my work is rubbish, just start, and get it over and done with.  Then go to bed.  Wish me luck.  
I	mirror.	I keep having these bad thoughts and they won't go away.  I don't want to act on them but it's getting harder.  I don't want to hurt anybody.  I keep sabotaging myself.  What am I supposed to do? Is suicide the only way? Deep down I don't believe that.  I'm just such a terrible person I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror.  
I've walked out of two jobs on the first day	I was so anxious	So my first day of my new (part-time) job is tomorrow, and I'm really nervous.   <e1> I've walked out of two jobs on the first day </e1>  because  <e2> I was so anxious </e2>  I thought I was going to have a panic attack on the spot.  I intentionally chose to apply at a place that I thought would calm me - it's a store that sells candles, lotions and such - but I'm just overwhelmed by this vague terror.  I don't know how I'm going to survive four hours. 
My	Thanks!	My wife and I have been smoking together for about a decade, and I smoked for about 5 years before that.  She needs weed to function and work due to her heavy PTSD and depression from sexual assaults.  I need to support her in her decision to smoke for her well being. It makes me into a lazy, unproductive employee and father.  I need to get my work and my house in order, cook better food for the kids, get more work done at the office and at home, keep up with the bills.  I'm failing on all fronts and I'm hoping I can muster the motivation to be better if I quit weed. You all seem like a great community, and I created this account just for r/leaves and r/loseit, so I wouldn't be distracted by the rest of Reddit. I appreciate any support.  Thanks!
I've	use	I've got a friend who I love dearly.  He's struggled with addiction for a long time, most recently with meth.  A week ago, he decided to sober up, and I've been trying to be encouraging, but am having trouble finding a balance.  I'm proud of him, but saying it sounds so condescending.  He says I know that I'll just end up back on it again eventually. . .  and I never know how to respond without sounding like an out-of-touch cheerleader.  He is surrounded by people who make him want to use
She physically abused everyone in my dad's family, save for me and my brother	we moved away before she had a chance to	My grandma has stage 3 pancreatic cancer and is starting chemotherapy next week.  My family, poor as dirt, wants to buy a plane ticket there and back which we can't afford to see her before she dies.  I told them I did NOT want to go and see my dying grandmother.  It sounds bad, but I've met her only 4 times.   <e1> She physically abused everyone in my dad's family, save for me and my brother </e1> , because  <e2> we moved away before she had a chance to </e2> .  I'd rather have my last memory of her being healthy anyways, not throwing up blood and barely breathing.  I need something to say to them so they won't take me.  I'm 16 so I'm subject to their rules, always.  Im deathly afraid of heights and flying, and they know this.  I want to save us money from the tickets that we can't afford, too.  Aaaaa this is hell. EDIT: Now, my Catholic father is interrogating me about religion.  It's hard to lie about being Athiest and I don't know what to say
I	Help	I don't want to write this on the internet but I have no one else.  I hate living.  I'm not angst about life.  I am just depressed all the time and wish to end the pain.  I feel lost all the time.  Most of my closest friends relationships have been distanced one way or another.  I tried coping by being a drug addict.  Now I'm sober and still feel the same way.  I think the only thing keeping me from doing it is the thought of suicide as a weak move.  A pussy decision.  But I'm starting to disregard that concept.  Help 
*Long	this	*Long read (I apologize for that). 22MAs stated in the title of this post, I have Math Anxiety and it has been leading me down a hole of doom ever since high school but I'm currently in college right now.  Funny thing is im good in Math but on almost every Math test . .  I blank out or make the smallest mistakes for no reason despite studying (This doesn't happen in any other courses except for Math which I find weird).  For studying I like to stay in the comfort of my home but I can get distracted by other people and that affects my focus so I usually have to wait until it's night time for any quiet/peace.  Because of this
I probably should have stayed	the doctor kinda said it was important to stay and I kinda just lied to get out faster and signed myself out against medical advice	I just don't want to go back.  And <e1>  I probably should have stayed </e1>  because  <e2> the doctor kinda said it was important to stay and I kinda just lied to get out faster and signed myself out against medical advice </e2> .  I'm worried that I will do it and that it may not be what I actually want to do and there's nothing I can do to reverse being dead once your dead.  But I don't want to go back to the hospital.  Is there any alternative that I can say I'm suicidal and not be put in a inpatient psych ward?
But he's interested either way	when the kids are praying their intentions, sometimes he also prays	Hi! I teach Sunday School (with another person) and one of the kids in the group has a ADHD.  I'm worried about it and about him, because when he's without his meds he can't really control himself, and disturbs the class, bothering the other kids (like poking them, stepping on them, pushing them. . . ). I don't really know what I'm supposed to do?How much physical contact is reasonable? Like, when we're praying, at the end, I usually grab him (like, I get him in front of me and hug him from the back) but then he steps on the others with his feet. . .   <e1> But he's interested either way </e1> , because  <e2> when the kids are praying their intentions, sometimes he also prays </e2> So, I just have no clue how to teach a class and to teach him.  I want them all to get the best out of this, and that inclues feeling good there and learning about their faith.  Any tips or links to help?I'll get some more questions and examples of doubts I have in the comment section. Thank you so much
I've	know	I've tried all the crap that you're supposed to try for this, and the only thing that helped at all is alprazolam (from a doctor of course).  But I'm afraid to get hooked on it.  I tried therapy, and it doesn't do anything for me.  I tried numerous antidepressants, and they either didn't work, or the side effects attrited me before it could kick in.  I no longer get anything from finishing tasks that I'm told give other people satisfaction.  I start crying randomly, and can't stop it.  What could I do if that shit hits when I'm at work or something? My friends either don't know
Don't	here	Don't worry, I'm in no danger of suicide, I just feel so overwhelmed and don't know who to talk to. I feel so exhausted and dead inside, like I've given everything I have to school and I have nothing left. Every ounce of will and passion, every cent in my wallet, every breath feels consumed and I don't know what to do. I only have two weeks left.  I'm so close to being done, but I just feel so god-damned dead and empty and so, so tired. My depression and anxiety have spiraled out of control these last two years and the medication is only helping to a degree.  I want to focus on me and try to fix myself but school is always taking all of the life out of me.  I can't wait to claim my life back, but I'm dragging myself to the finish line here
So,	reality	So, back for another episode of Let's Revisit Horrible Emotional Abuse in the Hope that Telling It Again Will Make Me Feel Less Awful and Alone.  Thanks for joining me. TLDR: My mom relentlessly fat shamed me and tried to control me and my eating.  <I wrote a blog post about the effect that being overweight had on my mental health, and she went berserk and threatened to kill herself. I started taking an antidepressant a few years back that made me gain a ton of weight very rapidly, as a serious and rare side-effect.  It didn't matter what I did: eating less, exercising more, etc, had no effect.  I kept gaining steadily until I went off it about a year later.  I was feeling horrible being so overweight, especially with gaining so quickly. Well, wasn't that the golden opportunity for Nmom! She has always been sensitive about her own weight, so she practically delighted in telling me how fat I'd gotten and masking it as concern for my health.  In reality
BPD	you?	BPD people who are dating, do you also tend to be very sensitive to rejection? Do you have certain rules of thumb for knowing whether someone is really interested or messing with you? 
As I grow I have lost about a dozen friends at work	I'm slowly starting to see that the only connection we had was we were both miserable	I'm making tons of progress across the board.   Things are rough but they are going good and getting better every day.   One thing that I have noticed and has been really difficult to deal with is seeing people who are stuck in the web of Narc and shitty family situations.    <e1> As I grow I have lost about a dozen friends at work </e1>  because  <e2> I'm slowly starting to see that the only connection we had was we were both miserable </e2> .   As my misery fades and confidence grows, it's like an invisible wall is going up between me and a lot of people.   It's like they are almost standing still everyday in the same spot.   Literally like they stand in the same spot, in the same room with the same down trodden look.   Part of me wants to go back to that life and/or help them or talk to them.   But now when i talk to those people it gets awkward REAL quick.   They have no hobbies, loves, passions or identity.   All they have is the obligation and guilt of the burden of their narc families. 
I'm just wondering	kratom was a super big bitch for me as far as post acute withdrawal, and coming up soon I'm going to begin my taper off of 2 mg per day of clonazepam	I'm just curious if anyone here has quit clonazepam, and if so, is it easier to quit clonazepam then kratom?  <e1> I'm just wondering  </e1> because  <e2> kratom was a super big bitch for me as far as post acute withdrawal, and coming up soon I'm going to begin my taper off of 2 mg per day of clonazepam </e2> .  I know everyone is different, but I'm just curious as to others experience around it
I'm	give.	I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask such a question, and I really don't want to upset anyone with this potentially sensitive issue, so if you're uncomfortable (well, more uncomfortable than usual) with the topic of physical abuse to children, please don't feel obligated to continue reading.  I was curious if the bruising on this child appears to be caused by physical abuse, or if they seem normal for a kid with very pale skin.  I'm quite pale, and when I was ten years old I had virtually no bruising (though I basically stayed at home all day).  I've attached a link below.  The album isn't graphic at all, just shows a kid going about daily business with a strange amount of bruises.  I wanted to know if this seemed indicative of abuse or not.  [IMAGES]( imgur. com/gallery/dJH0H)I'd like to end with the note that redheads, contrary to popular belief, don't actually bruise any easier than anyone else.  However, their light skin does highlight bruising more than other skin tones.  Thank you for any help you can give.  
No	explode	No one cares about me, everyone fucks me over, everyone talks shit to me, my parents think im a fucking looser i work my ass off in a job where i earn a fucking joke my grades are fucking disgusting i really fucking hate myself the piece of shit that i am, so fucking ugly, so fucking cringey and alone always, failing to talk to anyone no one fucking takes me serious and im just a toy for everyone to have fun and throw away.  What would happen if i kill myself? My parents would certainly be proud of their 2 real sons (im adopted) and wouldnt have to care for my pathethic life, in school everyone would give zero fucks im just so tired all the time so sad and so angry at my shitty life.  Sorry for this but I just reached my limit and about to explode
People always say they can't do it	their family	 <e1> People always say they can't do it </e1>  because of  <e2> their family </e2> , but my family doesn't care - and if I did it soon, I would be saving my family from the enormous expense of college for four years.  They would be better off if I died, and so would I.  My friends wouldn't care beyond pretending to be sad for a couple of days.  Every time I try to bring up my depression they always laugh it off.   I don't blame them for not caring about me - I'm just not good at building relationships I guess.  I wish I could be put down like a sick dog.  I can't even think about killing myself any other way without being scared shitless.  I'm going to be so miserable and lonely forever.  All I can do is continue to ruin everything I've built in my life by not doing anything
I'm staying open minded	my mental health is putting me in danger	About a month ago I consulted with a psychotherapist, had an intake a week later and am beginning my journey with long term relationship with this person.  Their practice focuses on BPD and bipolar disorder while using Buddhist principles in therapy.  Meditation being a big one for BPD.  I'm previously diagnosed ADD so I've never meditated, I don't do yoga, I also come from a fundamentally Christian upbringing and really dislike religion.  I know Buddhism is different, I just can't help but be skeptical.   <e1> I'm staying open minded </e1>  because  <e2> my mental health is putting me in danger </e2> , but I just want to know if any of you all experiment with meditation or mindfulness practices? I'm seeing a psychiatrist in a couple days and will be prescribed mood stabilizers so it's not entirely alternative medicine or what have you.  Sorry this is sort of everywhere - I'm just at the start of getting answers to questions I've had for a while 
Got	that.	Got shockingly invited to a party and said yes on a whim but I found out my friends aren't going and essentially I'll only know one person: the host. It's a small attendence too and I just feel like I'll stick out cause I am not even that close to the host too. I kinda wanna go just for exposure and to not have to regret later on missing out when I actually got invited somewhere this time. But I'm also scared of being the awkward boring quiet girl who no one knows and no one understand why she's there.  I know can't hog the host all night either.  So really there's so much potential for headache and stress, I feel so stupid for agreeing to go. I need . . . . I don't know, advice, tips on how to approach the situation? Do you feel it's a good idea to go and try or I'm just setting myself for failure? Also give me conversation tips, I really suck at that. 
I	Thanks	I have a lot questions for anyone with experience with depression or anxiety.  How do I know whether I am depressed or whether I'm just not doing well enough in life? Also how do I know if I have anxiety or just stress? I'm a 25 yr old Navy Nuke Vet and I am constantly overwhelmed it seems.  I either get so stressed that I get sick to my stomach ( which I'm starting to think might be anxiety) or I get so overwhelmed with life and not being able to keep up, that I shut down and can't do anything but sleep or sit around for days.  Also, if it is anxiety or depression, how do I fix it or even begin to mention it to my doctor? Everyone around me like my friends, family, coworkers, and my doctor have always known me to never have any problems health wise or stress or anything.  Is it possible to keep it hidden still if I do need some kind of treatment?So if anybody has any advice or experience, I'd be so grateful for your knowledge.  Thanks 
I	alone	I have a lot of anxiety.  It's gotten to the point where its really screwed up a lot of facets of my life.  I used to feel sad whenever I went through or remembered a bad social experience, often feeling sorry for myself and not really doing anything with those feelings.  After rueing over these experiences, I'd just feel empty. Now, I've been experiencing a lot more bursts of anger.  I'll audibly yell out a fuck or shit if I'm alone
I	instead.	I go through these phases, I've deleted all my social media, I don't want to see anyone and when I am forced to I am withdrawn and anxious and come away from the interaction feeling worse.  I feel like the only way I could deal with the world right now is if I was drunk but that isn't an option right now so I am being a hermit instead. 
I	interview	I got notified yesterday that I got a job interview I was so excited at first until i realized that im gonna be talking to someone which isn't that scary until I realized that it will most likely be a group interview  so now I'm really nervous . can you guys lend me some tips on how to be calm and not so terrified through out the interview
Yesterday	smoke.	Yesterday after work I asked a co-worker for a smoke and she said that she couldn't afford to give me one. At first I was pissed I couldn't be miserable with her but now I'm very thankful for it.  That small lapse would've been much more than just another smoke or resetting my counter.  It ties in to everything else I do and everything else I would've given up if I had that smoke. 
Considering going back to smoking	these awful feelings	Hey guys, I stopped 3 days ago and although I feel proud of holding for so long even if it's nothing compared to what do many of you have gone through already.  I smoked almost a pack a day, if that changes anything, for 1y and a half.  I noticed I became super aggressive.  I work in customer care but I find it too hard to control my anger.  I could before, but these last 24 hours have been horrible.  With my SO too, I got angry at him so much.  I also feel super depressed and empty without reason.  Is this normal withdrawal symptoms?  <e1> Considering going back to smoking </e1>  because of  <e2> these awful feelings </e2> .  I don't even get that many cravings, it's just my mood shifted suddenly and it's a bit scary. 
I	ssri.	I am 6 foot tall and 130 pounds (Used to be even skinnier).  Met a girl on tinder and she is down to hookup.  We are supposed to meet up tonight but I am very nervous (Also have struggled with anxiety and am on an ssri).  She looks to be very normal weight and is fairly attractive.  I on the other hand am average looking and my body is not attractive and am extremely skinny.  Super nervous and not sure if I should go through with this or wait a couple months and gain more weight before my first time.  Also if anyone has any first time tips, it would be much appreciated, esp if anyone has done their first time while on an ssri. 
1	screwed	1 year ago I was loving life on a daily dose of xanax.  Now my state has cracked down super hard on benzos, most Dr', including psychs,  tell you before you even ask that they no longer prescribe benzos.  Family dr won't write them, e. r.  gave me 3 mg and said that was their limit.  Finally found a walk in clinic that's going out of business that wrote me 45mg.  I'm on a waiting list to get into see a psychiatrist, but that's about a 3 month long wait.   So my question is this, what is the fda approving for long term anxiety meds.  I've tried ssri's and that was total hell.  With xanax I'm a perfectly functioning member of society, without I'm stuck in dysphoria.  I've tried yoga, breathing, excersise, I have an emotional support animal.  The only thing that makes life tolerable is that lil blue pill.  I'm debating on just going darknet, but don't wanna fail a drug test.  Hoping someone has a magical chemical I can try out since all the research I've done says I'm screwed
I've	cigarette?	I've just been diagnosed with COPD and have to absolutely quit smoking.   My worst time is first thing in the morning, so I've been reading excellent advise from other posts.   My main concern is will I really be happy if I can never have another cigarette?
One	night.	One of the first times it was confirmed for me that I was ugly was when I was in 8th grade at a Jr.  CYM (Catholic Youth Ministry ) trip.  It was an organized dance for the surrounding Catholic Youth Ministries in the area.  They were serving Little Ceasars Pizza ( I was exceptionally excited about this).  The dance was going, the lights were low, and a slow song came on.  I had some pre teen guy lead me to a bench.  He presented me to a friend to dance with.  The guy (friend) immediately laughed and said Ew! NO!.  He and his friends proceeded to laugh at me.  I faded to the sideline and did my best to disappear for the rest of the night.  
i	already.	i just want to die.  so mach. i was just on the verge of getting more trusting with her, and she's moving away.  i get to see her once, maybe two more times. ive been particularly down too and she suggested inpatient but i live with my parents and they never think my feelings are real, i cant tell them im going in but i would have to.  i was supposed to think it over tonight but im so sick to my stomach just thinking about it. my whole life is a mess.  i just want to end it already. 
To	happy!	To be honest, from an actually depressed person's perspective, i find the way they try to go about it pretty funny on how poorly it's done and how uninformed and inadequately prepared they are about thing such as depression. They way they help is they literally plaster posters every twenty feet with sh*t like, everyone deserves to be happy!
I've	experiences?	I've been having trouble falling asleep since I quit smoking.  I'm not sure it's withdrawals, it might be my default state as I grow older, just now noticing without weed to knock me out.  Both my parents have trouble sleeping.  But I sure never used to. Seems now I'm on a boom and bust cycle, where I'll sleep really poorly one night, then the next night be super tired and sleep amazingly for 10 hours.  I will say the sleep I do get is much more restful than when I was smoking.  My dreams are amazing.  I'm also much more alert during the day.  Overall I feel better.  I have no moderation when it comes to cannabis and smoked all day every day.  I couldn't just smoke in the evenings or something.  I mean I could if I wanted to try super fucking hard but it's just easier to not smoke. I forget exactly when I quit but I'm probably two, two and a half weeks out.  Anyone else with similar experiences?
I	else	I don't know if I should call it being overly critical, ever-going second-guessing or just overthinking.  Maybe all of them, even.  Here's how I feel:I'm always 'suspicious' of my own choices.  Not only do I often think that they're not good enough, but I'm even critical of the reasons I have for making the choices, as if I actually want to do it for something else
Was	do.	Was daily smoker for 7 years.  I quit for legal reasons.  I just laugh at all the stoners now as they all waste their time, money, and brain cells away.  I can now actually see how sad their life is/ my life was.  If you feel like you need to quit.  You do.  
I	do?	I am constantly bogged down with the feeling that my husband is mad at me, or any of my friends, or random strangers hate me, or a number of other related paranoias.  It is so exhausting.  It makes it harder for me to know when someone actually IS upset with me or when I've genuinely done something wrong.  It's all a blur.  Anyone else deal with this? What do you do?
It's	sad.	It's weird, I was reading through an old journal I had when I was 15 and it's very glossed over and everything had a happier twist.  As I was reading it triggered memories of those days that I didn't write down and it made me cry.  I don't even really know why, but it made me feel sad.  
This is an awkward anniversary	I can't celebrate it publicly	I just passed one year sober.  I thought I'd make some big post about the wisdom I've acquired or the inner peace I've found, but neither really describes where I am.  I'm basically the same as I was before, but sober.  My problems didn't suddenly go away, just my ability to escape from them with booze.  Sober life is unrelenting.  Whether it's hard or easy, happy to sad, it never stops.  I appreciate this engaged form of living even when it's difficult.  I'm going to stay sober because sober life, at it's worst, is never as bad as my life was with alcohol.   <e1> This is an awkward anniversary </e1>  because  <e2> I can't celebrate it publicly </e2> .  I can't post to Facebook or tell all my friends.  My brother called me to congratulate me.  He's also in recovery (for far longer), remembered my sobriety date, and called.  It was a really touching gesture and I'm grateful for those in my life who understand the struggle, including everyone in here.  I will join you all in not drinking today.  
Everything	go.	Everything feels so heavy and so full of pain.  I have been trying to make the sadness go away for so many years.  I feel like my entire life has been searching for reasons to live and waiting for things to get better, but each year seems to bring more hurt. I am very alone.  There is no one I am close to. . . everyone seems to hurt me.  I had one person I trusted and they're no longer my friend.  The pain from losing that friendship is very raw and it's pushing me over the edge. When I'm asleep the pain goes away.  I don't want to be sad anymore.  I don't want anyone to hurt me anymore.  I have some pills and I want to just take them, get into bed and let all the pain go. 
My	chest.	My 18th birthday is comming up and everything should be fine right? My academic performance is great and after starting lifting even some girls have started to notice me.  But love seems a distant thing.  Despite all this every morning, every day feels harder and harder to go through.  I question why to even bother with anything? Do i do it for my parents, myself, friends or society.  I still haven't found a answer to that question.  Thoughts of selfharm haunts me from time to time.  Not every night, not every week but when life seem especially hard the images creep up.  I dont want to do it.  Not to dissapoint my family or hurt them.  Not to put my friends in a though position.  But sometimes when life has beat you down the sadness makes me thinks its the best choice. This turned into a rant but i had to get it off my chest. 
Everything	.	Everything I do is a disappointment.  My parents say I'm a burden, then everything I own is cause if them and they constantly hold that against me.  They say my cousins are better than me in every way.  Smarter, physically stronger, mentally.  I've stopped eating much, only once a day just so they can be happy with me for once.  If I was such a burden why have me in the first place. . .  Just thinking how much better their life would be if I was never born.  I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just seeking attention. . 
Hi	this.	Hi everyone,I'm on meds for anxiety and depression, and this in conjunction with mindfulness and rationalising techniques I've learnt in therapy generally help me manage my anxious thoughts and mood fairly effectively.  However, I sometimes have some bad days (today's one of them) where I can't seem to get rid of that sense of unease, feel on edge and have real difficulty concentrating.  What do you do to calm yourself down and help yourself feel better when you're having one of those days? I'm particularly interested in knowing what people do when they're at a place like work or school and feel like this. 
I just feel like there is no reason to keep on living in this world alone, and empty	I was happy for a small amount of time but of course all good things do come to an end	 <e1> I just feel like there is no reason to keep on living in this world alone, and empty </e1> .   <e2> I was happy for a small amount of time but of course all good things do come to an end  </e2> (for me at least).  I feel as if there is no value in my life and continuing on much longer.  I try and try and try to wake up day by day by day with a positive attitude stating oday is going to be a good day.  I'm just ready to give it all up by now.  Like idk I just see no more hope. . like even if it does get better once more whose to say it just won't get worse again.  I assume these last few days are a sign to finally give up and just end this cycle of sorrow.  
I	-Jake	I planned this to be my last week alive, and it's been good, not great but good, seen most of my family and a lot of friends I haven't seen in a while.  I've done a lot of my favorite hobbys and I have one last huge party happening Saturday at my house with all my friends.  Nobody's knows of my plans but that's ok, so everyone will have a great night.  The next day I will clean my house and finish my notes.  After everyone leaves I will buy one last fifth of vodka, watch Good Will Hunting, maybe listen to my favorite music, and then do it.  I'm sorry to my parents and the rest of my family and friends, please don't blame yourselves and please don't be mad at me.  This pain and this world was to much for me, I love you, and I wish the best for you.  -Jake

I was so close to getting out of this shitty situation and now having to face my reality right now is just feeling really hard and oppressive	I've tried reaching out to a few friends but they haven't been as supportive	Like the title says, I feel really disconnected from friends and family.  My relationships aren't very loving at all like they used to be and I just feel completely lonely.  I mostly accept love though quality time with people and through touch, both of which I haven't had in the longest time.   I had a pretty good opportunity to move away from my current living situation into something that would probably be a lot healthier but things fell through and I think that's what really triggered my depression and suicide.   <e1> I was so close to getting out of this shitty situation and now having to face my reality right now is just feeling really hard and oppressive </e1> .    <e2> I've tried reaching out to a few friends but they haven't been as supportive </e2> .  I'm assuming if I came out and said I'm going to kill myself it would spur a more serious conversation but for some reason I can't do it.   Idk what to do.  Every morning I wake up and want to die.  
I	Yea	I told a friend how I was feeling at a particularity low point yesterday and he sent the police to my house and they brought a crisis counselor and they told my family.  I lied through my teeth so they wouldn't check me into a hospital but I still have people calling me every few hours and someone has to stay with me 24/7 until I get a therapist. I thought all of this would make me feel better but if anything, it makes me want to go through with it more.  They aren't going to be able to fix how I feel.  They all keep saying this is just something I'm going through but I've had suicidal thoughts and self-harmed since I was six.  My urge is now more desperate as I want to get it done before anyone gets too involved in helping.  Yea
was	time.	was really angry today - did one of my 'old' walks for the first time since quitting - and I was as puffed and puffing as much as ever .  Really disappointed, but after so many years of smoking I am sure my aerobic capacity must be way below par.  Swam a few lengths afterwards and they weren't so bad but I was soooo slow.  Hopefully my breathing will improve some more over time. 
I	bad?	I cleaned out all of the empty beer bottles from my room and tried to go to sleep.  I felt a rush of screaming thoughts go through my mind all night and my brain felt like it was changing. Anyways, I have work in an hour and am wondering how the fuck I'm going to sell any products today.  I look like shit and I don't want to start back on adderall.  Should I have a beer mid shift if it gets too bad?
I stayed home	a lack of vacation time	I think I can say that I have successfully reset.   Eternal vigilance is necessary, and I don't want to ever forget the guilt, shame, and compulsion I used to feel.   The demon is small and caged and kickable now, but he can grow again.   I don't want to get cocky, but porn is not nearly the temptation it used to be. My wife and kids just got back a couple days ago from a week-long trip;  <e1> I stayed home </e1>  because of  <e2> a lack of vacation time </e2> .   If there was ever a time to go wild with porn, that was the time.   And I was worried about it.   I posted here almost every day to be accountable, and I even specifically asked my wife to ask me how noporn was going. And it wasn't hard at all.   Twice I flirted with the edge, but after less than a minute I said, No and closed it.   And neither were real porn
I put off quitting my job for 7 years	the only time I've ever really looked for work was during the recession when it was impossible to get a job	 <e1> I put off quitting my job for 7 years </e1>  because  <e2> the only time I've ever really looked for work was during the recession when it was impossible to get a job </e2> .   I told myself to keep my head down and just be happy with what I had.   But I finally bit the bullet and quit and I didn't have anything lined up.   It was so scary.   I figured I might be out of work for months and I fretted all the time about how irresponsible I was to have not been applying for jobs while I was still employed.   However. I have been unemployed for 6 days and I have already gotten 2 phone interviews.   For GOOD jobs--equal money, equal benefits, better-sounding, less demanding responsibilities. I am in total shock.   I never expected to have OPTIONS.   I figured I would just desperately cling to any job that came my way, minimum wage or otherwise.   That I might be unemployed for a year, that I might be unemployable due to a gap on my work history.   My whole adult life
Normally on a night like that I'd be moderately annoyed that he brought alcohol home	we were rying to quit	. . . which I proceeded to smash! My fiance and I enable each other horrendously.  After years (outside of pregnancy) of black out binge drinking together, costing both of us multiple jobs, I'm putting an end to it, with or without him.  Last night I drank lots of tea while he drank 8 sixteen ounces and I actually thoroughly enjoyed it.   <e1> Normally on a night like that I'd be moderately annoyed that he brought alcohol home </e1>  because  <e2> we were rying to quit </e2> 
some	ass	some days i feel so anxious i could die, other days i feel so depressed i can't wake up.  and then there are the days when both my anxiety and depression decide to kick my ass
I	almost.	I hate myself/my appearance/ other stupid shit.  Tomorrow is my birthday, I shouldn't have lived to the last one.  Shouldn't have even been born.  I'm effing sick.  Mentally screwed up, not attractive in any way, badly overweight, antisocial.  My body doesn't match what I feel my gender should be- I'm FTM but I'll never be able to transition or pass.  No one who knows me tries to help with that outside of using my chosen name.  Not like I deserve to be happy anyway.  I deserve every scar on my thighs.  There's no feasible way out for me- well, almost.  
I've	?	I've been taking celexa for a year and I felt like a zombie, no emotions and e. d.  So I stopped cold turkey style and my doctor recommended WelbutrinXL.  Celexa withdraw is terrible, constant brain zaps, confusion, nausea and spaced out.  But I just realized that after a year, I finally got my smell back! I can smell the little things and I feel my nerves and brain are reacting now.  Any tips to get over withdrawal ? 
I've	advice?	I've posted about this before and was wondering if anyone has any tips they've tried.  I get depressed everytime I eat a full meal.  Snacks are fine, but when I eat a real meal I start feeling sad about halfway through.  Even if I don't eat it all or don't overeat.  I start feeling despondent, like life is horrible and I'll never amount to anything.   It started a few months ago.  I read about other people having this issue and one tip was to eat smaller meals.  I don't know if that will help but I'm going to try it.  Anyone tried this or have other advice?
I'm	know.	I'm living on my own (with roommates, but away from my toxic family).  I'm in graduate school.  I'm in a long-term relationship.  I have friends in person.  I am involved in another online community where I'm well-known and liked.  I can maintain a schedule (shower, exercise, get assignments done, get groceries, arrive at class on time, etc).  I don't have constant suicidal ideation any more.  I've never attempted.  I generally understand myself.  My flashbacks don't seriously impede on my life.  I've only had treatment for ~2 years.  No medication.  Just talk therapy and mindfulness/depression workshop. So maybe my abuse and neglect really weren't that bad? Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of what I go through than I should? I don't know. 
It's	way?	It's a feeling I can't shake.  That people are in on a life that I know nothing about.  That people have these close meaningful relationships that I just don't get the chance to experience.  I'd like to say I'd feel better if someone told me that they cared about me, or invited me to something first or was just extra friendly but all of those things have happened and I still can't shake the feeling.  How did I become this way?
My	him	My boyfriend finally broke things off with me, we were taking a break so I could try and better myself but he finally told me he had no interest whatsoever in getting back together with me anyway.  And even though he says he doesn't mind being just friends, I just. . .  can't do that, I've been intimate with him and I'd find it awkward to be just friends.  He was my soulmate and I can't imagine life without him
But still tears were shed	the issues (as always) were just things pertaining to the ADD	I'm not in a bad place, <e1> But still tears were shed </e1>  because  <e2> the issues (as always) were just things pertaining to the ADD </e2> . It never gets any easier does it?It's a hard life, it starts to bring you down the longer you keep fighting. But you gotta keep fighting, that's all we can do right~
Over	you.	Over the last few weeks or so in light of the recent news, I've been having some very morbid thoughts about a nuclear bomb being dropped on my city.  Naturally I'm a very hopeless person and my life is shit but I get some weird special comfort knowing that it all can be gone, everyone around you who has succeeded at life will be reduced to smoldering piles of bones just like you.  All of their material possessions, cars, etc will be vaporized, all of their memories gone.  All of the faces of beautiful girls you've longed for will be burned away, etc.  In the end they'll all be just like you. 
Alright.	tips?	Alright. . . So. . .  Long story short, My mother abuses me.  As a result, I exhibit a lot of the behaviour in the FAQ (low self-esteem, can't say no, terrified people will betray me, constant daydreaming, neutral state 70% of the time,etc. ) However, my biggest issue is that I tend to obsess and break down a lot, even over trivial things.  I start worrying about insignificant things or mistakes, and start feeling like I'm slowly suffocating, and often times a random wave of sadness and self-loathing washes over me, and I start sobbing, or just end up moving somewhere alone and trying to get my emotions back under wraps.  I can't stop it, and I'm pretty sure I'm annoying my teachers and my friends.  Do any of you have any tips?
My	posh	My last big drinking night was a works do just before Christmas.  I was drinking pints of red wine.  Someone I now consider a friend said I was very entertaining.  He invited me to a dinner last night.  We don't know each other very well, only through work, but we both really like each other and I was happy to accept.  He said it's about time we saw drunk you again.  This whole week I've been really worried about this dinner.  There won't be many people I know and my friend is expecting me to repeat Decembers performance.  I decided to drive using the excuse of having to be up early.  My friend is disappointed.  We get to the table for the dinner (a really posh
I dont have stability	he always makes me travel with him	I got a shithead abusive stepdad.  I dont really know what im going to talk about and what I wont in here.  But things are just bad at home.  Not sure what im ready to share, but hes awful.  Beats me up, uses me as a way to get money, literally im just some sex object,  <e1> I dont have stability </e1>  because  <e2> he always makes me travel with him </e2> .  Anyways, would appreciate a friend I can talk to about all this, I dont usually open up about any of this.  Was told to post on here so.  
I already know that is half true	in the past, i had my dream job as a laboratory research assistant in my undergrad years	i have seen in many forums that anxious people have a hard time staying at one job whilst enjoying it.   <e1> I already know that is half true </e1>  because  <e2> in the past, i had my dream job as a laboratory research assistant in my undergrad years </e2> , then i spent a whole freaking month without attending my work because my anxiety about the job go so high that i used escaping as a coping method.  Even this other time, i worked at a clinic in an administrative position where i have to help customers in a different language (spanish) but i had panic attacks that my spanish wasnt as good so i kind of used to spend hours crying in my office.  fun i know.  So, if we know that anxiety is the reason doing all of this mess, what is a way to get around it.  Can all anxious people meet toegther and form a work environment where it caters to the needs to of the disorder lol? probably will not involve alot of meetings and presentations lol 
she broke up with me	I was getting sadder and sadder	Since 2015 I`ve been living alone in a apartment in a big city. I earn money for rent and food by playing online poker. I am on a year-long break from uni, due to failing a few tests. I used to have a beautiful gf,  <e1> she broke up with me </e1>  because  <e2> I was getting sadder and sadder </e2> . I used to go to parties every week and have fun, noone invites me anywhere anymore. Over the last 2 years I slowly lost contact with everyone I knew. Now I don`t know anyone.  Every day, I stay at my apartment.  Every time there`s a good weather and I want to travel or do something fun, I have noone to do it with, so I don`t. I`m bored by everything and everyone.  I feel nothing except for sometimes missing the good times.  And I seem to have accepted this lifestile of staying home, alone. I exercise and eat healthy, I am an attractive 22 yo male but that`s not a life worth living.  My youth is fleeing, day by day. 
I	hide	I live at home with both Nmom and NDad.  I also have a brother.  We'll call him C.  I am 17, 2 months away from being 18.  NMom feels like she still owns me as if I was 13.  She constantly barges into my room just to lecture about parenting or to just see what I am doing.  Both C and I come home from school frequently and find our rooms have shifted slightly, signs someone has been rummaging through it. She turned my doorknob backwards so I couldn't lock her out.  She threatened to just take it away if I didn't let her in. She always says If you have nothing to hide
Whether	anymore.	Whether its marathon jacking off to hardcore porn or smoking weed all day everyday, I tend to overdose on consciousness.  I tend to swing for the fences.  I get really high from these behaviours and then I have to eliminate that high so that I can experience it again.  I have to reverse the person I am when high from these things.  As high as I get, that's how low I gotta get.  I get so low its insane.  But its all part of the plan to keep experiencing that rush if happiness and goodwill to myself.  If I don't reverse myself, turn myself inside-out, then I can't keep re-experiencing myself as I like to do.  I think the solution is to stop with these consciousness-expanding behaviours.  They force me to 'kill' myself mentally just to purge myself of all consciousness so that I have room to do it all again.  If I stick to a reasonable level of consciousness, I won't have to keep 'killing' myself.  I'll be able to eliminate my consciousness reasonably through exercise, perseverance, and sleep.  The extreme self-hatred and self-doubt won't be required anymore.  
It allows people to walk all over me	I can't defend myself	So I have always had this weird issue with arguing with people.  I come off very stupid, and I'm very afraid of insulting people.  My brain freezes up.  Even if it's just with a girl at work over something trivial, if they start to get angry I just shut off.  <e1> It allows people to walk all over me </e1>  because  <e2> I can't defend myself </e2> .  The minute things come to fighting I'm fine though, I am a mixed-martial artist so that part comes very natural.  It's just before the fighting I freak out and can't handle myself.  I get that deer in the headlights thing.  I feel like these two things are normally the other way around.  People are okay yelling but freeze up when things get real.  Any ideas? I feel like it has to be some type of anxiety because it makes me really sad when I get walked all over.  Even when I plan out what I'm going to say I just get lost.  
Im	depressed	Im on lexapro since 3 weeks, wellbutrin 300mg since 6days and abilify 15mg since 7days Im trying to treat anhedonia motivation problems low energy and social anxietyI still do not feel any differentI dont have more energy The anhedonia didnt decreaseI still have motivation problemsWhen does it start to kick in ?Does this combo is good for anhedonia?Should i swap lexapro with high dose (200mg) zoloft ?Is anhedonia really incurable for most people ?Can i regain sexual pleasure ?  Im a male and i suffer from anhedonia since 8 yearsNever tried to cure it until nowRight now im not really depressed, a little sad yeah but not depressed
My	first	My last drink has been well over 120 days ago and I'm appoaching the 4 month markI'm happy with my sobriety however there are a couple things. .  I took molly and coke on 2 separate occasions within month 1.  Since then I been clean beside smoking some pot here and there. .  I talked to my sponsor honestly about pot when asked about it and my sponsor is fine with it. What now? I don't plan on consuming drugs again however I'd like to get some insight with my particular case.  I'm new to this and didn't know better at first
I'm	persisted?	I'm sure there's post after post on this, but can anyone tell me how this medication has changed their lives, especially those with social anxiety or PMDD? I have horrible social anxiety to the point where I will go hungry for days to avoid leaving my home and being near people.  It's better when I'm with someone, but even then, I can't handle places with people very well.  I know CBT would help a lot, but I don't have money for therapy right now.  My doctor wants to try Lexapro.  I was really excited to.  However, a user here told me to watch out for post ssri sexual dysfunction that doesn't resolve after quitting the drugs, and I got scared off. TLDR has Lexapro helped you? What was the starting period like? Have you guys tried any non SSRIs that helped a lot? Did you have major sexual issues that persisted?

This morning I was at the verge of tears	another failure	16 days in and resetting.   I was drunk and a bit depressed and then it happened.  Longest I have ever gone without smoking, and I really thought it was all over.  I had been out at a party before and I had no cravings, so I don't know what happened.   <e1> This morning I was at the verge of tears </e1>  because of  <e2> another failure </e2> , and since my parents are coming next week I was so looking forward to them being proud of me and I cannot bring myself to request a new badge already. Just had to get that off my chest!
learning Italian	I live in Italy	Computers/Video games/Reddit.  I don't know how to stop myself I feel guilty on getting on any of them.  I feel like I should be bettering myself but don't know where to start.  Even if I pick one thing ( <e1> learning Italian </e1>  because  <e2> I live in Italy </e2> ) I feel anxious to even start. I always have this feeling that I can't accomplish anything.  How the fuck do I make this feeling go away. 
Working	:/	Working out seems to make me more anxious and make me pay more attention to my anxious, negative (and not all logical) thoughts. I know working out and exercise can reduce symptoms.  Reduce the bodily feeling of anxiety, and use the adrenaline build up in the body. Yet when I am at the gym, I have nothing to engage my mind, and whatever I am anxious about or has me stressed, will fill my mind completely.  There is no escape.  Another observation is that the longer I work out, the more my willpower gets depleted.  I am less capable of controlling my thoughts, less capable of using the many techniques I daily employ, and the more negative they spiral. Does anyone else experience this? What do you do to overcome it? I feel exercise is so important for health and mood balance, but it is also hindering me so much :/
Since	know.	Since last year, my physical and mental health has significantly declined.  I was severely depressed and chronically sick, and the same applies now.  I think I might be cursed or living in hell.  I went to the doctors at times, but nothing wrong was found.  I just feel, sick.  Fatigued.  In physical pain.  I'm a hypochondriac and I really want to see a doctor even though I'm scared of them just to confirm I don't have cancer or something.  I don't know how to explain it.  All I can say is that I'm constantly in pain and in bad health both physically and mentally.  I just want to end the pain.  Prayer doesn't seem to work.  Oftentimes I'm close to tears and I spend the entire day on my phone or on my computer or sleeping.  I have zero friends, I'm ugly as fuck, I have NF1, everything has declined.  Please.  Help.  Me.  I NEED the pain to end.  If anyone knows of painless suicide methods besides the exit bag, please, let me know. 
I	so.	I am still going.  Hope to make it another week.  It gets easier.  I don't think about smoking very often.  But I do think about it.  No physical pain any more.  I think I am still a bit down emotionally / mentally.  Stick to it if you want to quit.  In my experience a day or two after you get the nicotine out of you system you start feeling better.   So day 5 or so.  
Hey	time!	Hey all,I have a one month followup with my family doctor tomorrow and I'm a little anxious about what usually goes on, and what I should tell her.  Does anyone have an idea of what usually goes on/What I should say? My medication did help with my anxiety for a week but it seems to be back again.  I'm worried that I might not tell her the right thing or that I will have to change my medication or maybe I don't have anxiety but something else wrong (like a tumor or something?).  Thank you for your time!  
Block	with.	Block of flats over the road.  Jumping off them seems so attractive right now. My dog just had to be put to sleep.  She was literally my only friend in the world.  It was a terrible experience too, they could not find her vein and lasted about 30 minutes total.  She trusted me so much and I had to hold her down for 30 minutes while they stabbed her with needles trying the find the vein.  I am socially awkward as fuck, no friends, no gf, family dont really give a fuck.   Only thing i got is that I am pretty smart and about to finish University (likely with a good grade) but what do I do after that? Get some job I probably wont enjoy and have nobody.  Running out of reasons. Not entirely sure why I am posting this here.  Maybe I just want to get it off my chest before I go over the road.  Maybe it will help.  Maybe I will feel better tommorow.  Maybe I should just do it now, get it over with. 
This	forgetting	This is something like my 5th or 6th reset.  I first joined a little over a year ago on a different account: I wanted to have a small drink to calm my nerves the night before I took my LSAT, wound up draining all the liquor in the house and making an embarassing phone call, woke up the next morning so hungover that it must have made a big difference in my performance. Number of resets between that and this one, where it turns out that I **fucking cheated** on my partner last night (I kissed her friend).  I don't even remember doing this.  For sober me, this is unthinkable.  I'm tired of finding out how shitty I am in new and exciting ways.  I want to be the type of person I am sober all the time.  The problem is that I keep forgetting
I	come.	I will not lie.  Today has actually been rough.  I have been a zombie all day.  Just down and sad all around.  I kinda expected this though.  It's my day off and I'm by myself right now.  I've done everything I can think to keep my body busy and my mind even busier.  For some reason it hasn't been enough or easy at all.  The weather is dreadful with high winds, rain coming in waves, and lower 50's to boot.  I feel literally under the weather. The best I can do for the rest of the day is curl up on the couch and binge watch movies.  Maybe I need to take a much needed break from fighting to be healthy again.  Tomorrow I'll ride my bike and discover something new.  Hang in there.  Keep sharing.  Keep talking.  Keep going.  The best is yet to come. 
Like	planned	Like when you have a plan set, you are in your zone (I only have a zone after my meds; I am otherwise zoneless) and someone or something dashes your carefully laid out schedule.  Or even if you make a tiny plan, or have a certain idea of how something is going to go, and then all of a sudden it is changed.  It irritates me, like a flea on a dog's ass, but it shouldn't be that big of a deal.  My internal dialogue usually involves I had things planned
Good minds should not go to waste	the application process is overwhelming	Today, I was looking at the CollegeBoard website, and came across [BigFuture]( collegeboard. org/)BigFuture is a portion of CollegeBoard dedicated to guiding students through the college admissions process.  As someone who's been struggling with the overwhelming process of choosing a college and beginning the application process, this breaks all the steps down into tiny, manageable chunks, and has progress meters for the different steps towards applying to college:* Making school count* Looking ahead to college* Careers and majors* Finding colleges for you* Applying for college* Paying for college The plan shifts as you progress through each school year, and provides reminders for planning next year's classes, applying for and receiving financial aid, application dates for college  due dates and when things like deposits are due for university housing.  The website also allows you to calculate your cost contribution to college, and to keep track of your test registration and academic progress.  This site is a godsend for people like me, and I wanted to spread awareness.   <e1> Good minds should not go to waste </e1>  because  <e2> the application process is overwhelming </e2> .  
One	them.	One of my best friends has been messaging me for a while saying how she has been suicidal and considering downing medication and such.  Ive told her how much people care and how she shouldn't do it many times.  Tonight she messaged me and told me she had tried talking to her boyfriend, other friends, and parents and none of them really tried to help her, and that she tried hanging herself this weekend.  What can I do to help her? I feel like the things I keep telling her may come off as ingenuine if I keep saying them. 
My	appreciated.	 My friend, 16, has been showing tell-tale suicide warning signs.  They're trans FTM and have made a will (about a month ago), they're cutting, they're not eating, they're an amazing artist but their recent art has been of slit open wrists and the like.  Today they broke up with their boyfriend of four months but are trying to stay friends with him.  As time goes on, they're getting more distant and paranoid of judgement.  They have considered suicide before, even writing a note.  They have expressed that they have anxiety and that they're depressed but some of their friends just tell them they're not.  Their parents won't support them and calls them an attention seeker.  Unfortunately, the school counsellor is not very supportive.  My friend and I are wracking our brains trying to think of ways to help them, but can't think of anything that won't screw something up or backfire.  It would be a lot of help if anyone could give some advice on this situation.  It would be greatly appreciated. 
I	physically	I recently turned 18, I was going to have a friend celebrate my bday with me, but my friend doesnt exist.   I want to explain who I am to you bc I need someone who can give me something helpful to work off of.   so here it goes. . . The birthday thing is just one of my thoughts, one I had yesterday when I was thinking back to my bday.   I think my mind just works to make me feel worse, my body just functions to give my mind pain, and myself, I'm some sort of entity stuck within that cycle. My reality has so far been what most people would call sad but I wouldnt call it that at all.   It is what it is  That's probably my favorite saying bc it's reflexive and it reminds me that the world will continue to exist in the present physically
I	exist	I literally have thoughts of wanting my husband's friend dead I hate how much fun there having I wish I was like his friend I get really angry like what do I have to do be better than him ? :( Whenever he brings him up we fight or argue than I get so mad it's like a trigger I just know my life would be so much better if he didn't exist 
Hey	difference!	Hey thanks to all of you for your advice and support.  I fell off the wagon hard last year and spent 6 months drunk and ashamed to come back here.   You've all been really supportive and non judgemental, that has made all the difference!
I	away?	I have about year left (college graduation).  Some stuff has been going down recently and it's become very very difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I am just so not in control of my own life.  I'm not gonna kill myself or whatever, but I understand why someone would.  If you've left, no matter if you've gone NC, LC, or still maintain regular contact, what do you love most about being away?
^Like	time.	^Like I get very detached from reality.  I seem to have emotional depth only in dealing with the abstract rather than anything relevant to my life.  Very clumsy with spending time.   
It's	bit.	It's getting closer to my appointment day and I am getting more nervous everyday,I want to bring up antidepressants but I am scared that he may take it the wrong way, I am probably making myself crazy over something minor and normal, but I've tried several natural treatments over the years and nothing worked. I have a list off all my problems and I am scared that It's weird when I show it to himmy last talk with him was about 2Years ago. I just had to vent a bit. 
In	same?	In the cosmic scale of things, me dying 50 years early means nothing.  Me and my pathetic lifespan are but a speck living on a speck orbiting yet another speck and so on and so forth.  Sure, some people would be sad, but they too will die eventually.  In the infinite non existence of nothingness, even the entire universe and its age are all but a tiny speck.  Me living 50 extra years and some highly mortal people being a bit less sad ultimately means absolutely nothing.  So why bother holding on? why keep fighting a losing battle? Why stop myself from quitting the game that is called life a little early when the result of continuing to play is the same? 
I quit on 4/19	technically 4/20 was first day not smoking in 3 years straight everyday	Just quickly give you some info of me if it helps you pinpoint when I should be coughing crap/tar/black/whatever up.  <e1> I quit on 4/19 </e1>  so  <e2> technically 4/20 was first day not smoking in 3 years straight everyday </e2> .  I smoked 8-12 good bong bowls (were talking 3g+ a day AT LEAST about 2Oz a month I think??)Always bong, never jay/vape (vapes safest/healthiest right?). Don't REALLY have many problems getting to sleep, have had like 3 vivid dreams.  None of which were scary just, ya kno', vivid lol.  I feel fine now but between days 5-6 I felt stressed out and really wanted to smoke and felt angry about everything.  That was the only time I actually had a craving to smoke.  Otherwise I feel almost no different.  So my trigger is when I'm pissed I would usually smoke weed, now I just call my gf / family and talk for a bit. 
Sometimes	.	Sometimes when I walk I get this sudden sensation that the surrounding is not moving, yet I am walking.  I feel like I'm on a treadmill and caught in a loop.  I know it's irrational, but afterwards I get this intense fear that I'm not real and I'm somehow caught in a loop? What should I do? It makes me very anxious when this happens and usually it's self inflicted but I can't control it.  I keep thinking, what if it happens again? and my mind makes it look like the background is not moving.  Sometimes I stop walking, close my eyes for a second and then walk again.  It doesn't happen very often, but it's really scary when it does and extremely annoying. . . 
I	over.	I feel giddy right now.  I am finally going to kill myself and I feel so happy and carefree.  I think I'll go buy some drugs and get really high before the time comes.  Everyone is looking at me like things are just dandy and I'm so happy.  It feels like I really fooled them all.  I've finally reached the end.  It's the final day, the prophesized moment.  I feel like I knew it was coming a while ago.  I mean I feel like I really found out somehow that i was going to die soon and I've been really anxious about it but now that I finally know I feel so free.  It feels like the end of all the bad times for me and that's literally all I care about anymore.  I just want the bad times to end so badly and I finally feel free.  I know other people will suffer because of what I'm doing but I honestly can't even care about them.  I only care about myself right now and this is how it had to be.  I'm finally dead.  It's finally over. 
I've been on prednisone (prescribed by doctor) for the past few days	Because of this, I've avoiding the magnesium I had been taking	Lately, I can't breathe right through my nose.   <e1> I've been on prednisone (prescribed by doctor) for the past few days </e1> .   <e2> Because of this, I've avoiding the magnesium I had been taking </e2> .  I've been dizzy most of today.  Driving home, breathing funny, dizzy, and dry mouth, I looked at my hands and they were so pale! I immediately panicked a bit.  I didn't have the actual panic attack, but I've felt for likely to have one.  Should I go to the ER? Edit: 16 days
i have to figure out why i go back	i can adress it	I was just looking back on my old posts from a year or so ago, i hadnt a clue about being pmo free doing mofap and watchinh porn lm thinking now like what was i at? anyway i have an issue i keep puting myself down and relapsing I dont call myself an addict i call myself silly going back to porn and masurbation but  <e1> i have to figure out why i go back </e1>  so  <e2> i can adress it </e2> , i can go 90 days if i just put the work in for it it getting me to do it is the problem. 
I know it's an irrational thing	we can still see each other	Hey everybody,so ever since I'm about 7 years old I've been dealing with separation anxiety.  As I figured out while being in therapy, it most likely started with my dad passing away around that time.  I don't think it's a very severe case, but it's still very stressful and right now I'm also taking medication.  I've been married for almost two years now and my husband will be going away for a couple of weeks.  We will be able to see each other, but he can't sleep at home and that is already giving me panic attacks and anxiety.   <e1> I know it's an irrational thing </e1> , especially cause  <e2> we can still see each other </e2> , but just the thought of coming home to an empty apartment and having to sleep alone at night is driving me crazy.  I have super irrational thoughts and can't think straight up to the point where I just start crying hysterically and let the panic attack happen until I calm down.  So are there any other people struggling with the same problem, that maybe have some advice for me?
I'm	college?	I'm feeling extremely anxious and depressed right now.  I had two weeks off school because of holidays and tomorrow i'm finally going back.  Only one more month to go.  Only one more month of stress.  I have to do well on my last tests to pass the semester and the fact of going back and being alone in my dorm having to study all day just makes me want to cry.  Presentations in front of my class, exams.  I'm usually a very extroverted person and don't mind presentations but i've had a really bad semester and my anxiety is just terrible right now plus the fact i'm extremely depressed.  How do you cope with anxiety while in college?
Hi	Thanks!	Hi all,I am an anxious/stressed person and am quite curious about CBT/hypnosis/NLP.  Any recommendation for someone in New York? Your personal experience regarding the impact of hypnosis for stress management? Also, how much does it generally cost? I found a guy that does the first session for 350 dollars and follow ups at 200 which sounds expensive to me. . . Thanks!
I don't remember my quit date for kratom	I was using other drugs too	I wish I had find this subreddit before I quit.  Seems like a great resource.   <e1> I don't remember my quit date for kratom </e1>  because  <e2> I was using other drugs too </e2> .  Last time I used recreational drugs was May 31 2016.  After tapering down
Music	do?	Music keeps me alive, I live for beats and rhythms and meaningful lyrics.  I love it so much that I want to try to make some of my own but I keep feeling discouraged.  I know I can't sing so I have no access to vocals and, I'm going to university.  People always say its a waste of time and its not something worth getting into but I'm bored and music makes me happy.  How can I get started? I don't really want my music to get noticed, just want to post it on youtube, get some feedback and work on it to make beats and things I love.  I'm not into that techno/electric stuff, by beats I mean real instruments like drums as in hip-hop, RnB tracks.  What do I do?
unless I am feeling particularly shitty	I can never remember how I felt or what I thought	So I have finally booked an appointment with a doctor.  It took me a while to get the motivation to, but I have.  It's good, they specialize in treating teens and young adults. I have been using an app to track my moods and write little entries, only like a sentence or two (more of a rant tbh in a lot of them. . . ).  it's good because  <e1> unless I am feeling particularly shitty </e1> ,  <e2> I can never remember how I felt or what I thought </e2> .   Only I am worried that the doctor will go 'oh they kept a diary, they are obviously motivated enough to function in life they are not depressed they just need to try'.  I'm worried and scared.  Help. 
Essentially,	while?	Essentially, if you haven't heard there was a stabbing attack at the University of Texas at Austin.  It lasted only two minutes but the effects of been felt by the entire student body.  I had just gotten out of class and said goodbye to a friend.  I heard some commotion about something happening right outside our gym.  I went over and saw a crowd of people gathering, only to find the EMTs performing CPR on another student.  I quickly left the scene and soon information was pouring in.  Luckily none of my friends were injured, but I worried for their safety for most of the day.  Completely reasonable stress, but now it is 11:40.  I have an exam tomorrow.  Yet I keep going in and out of these stress episodes.  I didn't see the attack, only the aftermath.  Yet here I am scared of what I saw and scared about what is going to happen.  I have finals coming up and I am worried about my performance.  Does anyone have any tips on how to sort of put this out of mind for a while?
I'm	any	I'm five days off of daily coke, almost daily xanax, and monthly use of a bunch of other shit, and it's not going too bad.  I mean obviously life is worse, I'm not high anymore so I figured it'd be worse, but it hasn't been as hard as I thought it would, first two days were definitely difficult, if I hadn't been in another state and away from all my drugs and dealers and friends there's no way I would've made it.  However, I'm back home.  I flushed everything as soon as I walked in the door, kind of a shame to see all that go to waste but whatever.  But then I got a text from my friend who I always do coke and smoke with and he bought a ball that seems short, I'm the only one of my friends that  made the effort to buy a scale but he wants me to come weigh his shit for him.  I told him k quit everything and he gave me the ah come on dude you can come and just weigh it for me you don't have to do any
I	try.	I didn't see counselors in high school to set up for college, I don't see counselors now that I'm in college despite me not knowing what I want to do and thinking about dropping out, I'm too shy to join the military, I'm too shy to apply for new jobs.  I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do aside from just suck it up, but I'm too scared to even try. 
It	no?	It was just making me miserable but now I fear I have no one to talk to.  Not that anybody actually spoke to me there anyway except one or two people.  But I hated the attention that others were getting when nobody was even replying to my messages.   I guess it can be a blessing in disguise as well? Maybe now I should focus on meditating, eating right, exercise and then look for a job? FB wasn't the solution to depression, anxiety, isolation or loneliness anyway, no?
Soooo,	working!	Soooo, read a post on the ShowerThoughts sub, and just discovered that there are people out there that truly believe the earth is flat. . .   What the what??  Thanks ADHD, for once again shoving me down the rabbit hole. . .   Already lost 2 hours of my day.   I don't believe this myself, but still, fascinating to see why people believe this!!  Gah - I'm supposed to be working!
I'm	today.	I'm feeling completely empty.  I'm happy I'm not drinking and, quite frankly, I don't remember the last time I got to Day 7. . .  probably May 2016.  However, I'll get there tomorrow and I'll be there for it.  I just won't be happy or sad or angry or present for it.  I'll just be numb.  I'm trying to be happy and improve but, right now, it's just not there.  Memories of my most recent relapse that involved ripping into someone who I introduced to my circle of friends that then, I feel, took over and replaced me are dominating my mind.  I know that that's not the case and I shouldn't blame the person but the emotions are present.  All I do is come to work, go home, hang with my partner when I can, and repeat.  I don't want any friends anymore.  I don't even know what I want.  Maybe just an escape. . . which is what got me here in the first place. I won't drink with you today. 
Tomorrow will go to 1. 25, next day to 0. 75 and day after to 0. 25 and then stop	I leave for an extended trip next Tuesday where bring Kratom isn't and option	I've been using kratom straight for a year+ at 4-5 grams a day in the morning.  I've tapered over the past week to 1. 75g and am now feeling what I imagine the withdrawal to be - clammy hands, a general unease.  I feel uncomfortable but certainly not overwhelming enough to where I am focused on it - been able to work and go about my day.  I don't feel emotionally down or anything (but wasn't depressed prior to use).  <e1> Tomorrow will go to 1. 25, next day to 0. 75 and day after to 0. 25 and then stop </e1> .  I am doing this because  <e2> I leave for an extended trip next Tuesday where bring Kratom isn't and option </e2> .  I'm actually kind of excited to do this and take a break from Kratom. Thoughts? Will things get much worse? My hope is that my usage has been low enough (and not frequent, 1xday) that I'll be spared some of the horror that I've read here.  While happy to be doing this, I'm a bit scared.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated!
I sad	my bestie is leaving for 2 weeks and I know she is going to have tons of fun seeing all her girlfriends	My mood really hasn't improved through out the day.  I am as depressed as most 13 year olds get for no apparent reason.  I know this is part of it.  It will subside after a while and so on.  Right now I just feel numb and sad at the same time.   <e1> I sad </e1>  because  <e2> my bestie is leaving for 2 weeks and I know she is going to have tons of fun seeing all her girlfriends </e2> .  She deserves it.  Putting up with my ass these last two weeks has probably been a drag for her.  Two weeks and I'm sitting here thinking it will be an eternity.  Hopefully when she comes home I'll be 10 times better and we can do all the things we did before kratom entered our lives. Thanks for letting me vent today.  Thank you for the pep talks via comments.  I really appreciate it very much so.  God, I want these blues to go away asap. 
when I am around people I like I can't be myself	I'm afraid I'm going to say something ridiculous or embarrassing	Hey guys, I'm in college right now but I feel as though I make people uncomfortable.  I say weird things, things that make sense to me but don't fit in the conversation.  I approach people at weird times and start up awkward conversations.  My friend even said that I can act a little weird.  I went through a small religion faze and talked about that. .  and I think that made people feel uncomfortable too.  I don't know why I'm so weird.  And I don't know if the illness made it worse. . .  but I feel as though it did.  I don't have any friends at school. .  girls aren't interested in dating me. .  and  <e1> when I am around people I like I can't be myself </e1>  because  <e2> I'm afraid I'm going to say something ridiculous or embarrassing </e2> .  I don't know, does anyone else feel as though they've gotten weirder since their mental illness started? Do you guys ever make people feel uncomfortable? 
I'm	some.	I'm 22 years old and I've been a heavy smoker for about 8 years now (weed and cigarettes).  I decided to kick both habits.  All or nothing kind of thing.  I've suffered from major depression and anxiety all my life, but I found some peace with marijuana over every prescription drug or recreational drug I've tried, but now I can't get out of bed.  I have no desire to do anything but cry.  Im having suicidal thoughts and I'm thinking of calling a local outpatient rehab program tomorrow.  Any advice? I could really use some. 
i always imagine dying or killing myself	i like imagining my nmom finally feeling bad for the way she has treated me	 <e1> i always imagine dying or killing myself </e1> , not because i'm suicidal at all.  because  <e2> i like imagining my nmom finally feeling bad for the way she has treated me </e2> , seems like the only way she would ever notice the terrible way she treated me.  
After	experiences?	After putting aside many problems in my life I finally decided to talk with my mother about seeing a doctor about any potential mental illnesses I may have.  We went to see my doctor today, he referred me to a call line and prescribed me a drug, my mother says is for children with ADHD, she won't let me know the name of the drug, or get the prescription.  After talking with her, she refuses to let me take the drug, even though the only reason I went to talk to anyone was to fix my problems, I am disappointed in her narrow mindedness.  Anyone have similar experiences?
Hi	made	Hi all, I'm looking to build tools to solve issues surrounding organisation and focus for people dealing with ADD/ADHD symptoms - I have some code that I've been working on but it would help me finish and publish one if I had an idea of which would help other people more.  (Obviously I'm finding it a challenge to finish these without extrinsic force)The ideas tend to revolve around **restriction** as a way of increasing focus and reducing distractions. Please let me know if any of these would fit problems that you face: 1.  browser plugin - sets your number of maximum browser tabs to 4 ( ( or whichever value ) to prevent choice paralysis. 2.  desktop application - disables access to certain applications ( also the internet ) based on a schedule that you define.  3.  daily to do - a resetting to do list to help you stay organised with the small things that need to be done everyday, includes alarmsthanks for your input, here's hoping something helpful can be made
{background	Idk.	{background info}He was emotionally abusive and took a lot of money off of me in result of my mental state.  We've not spoken for 6 months+, and I don't want anything to do with him now.  Having some really mixed feelings about this. Kinda stirred up some hate, kinda happy he lied about losing weight (I know that's petty af, but I am) and that he's not dived into another toxic relationship. I'm trying to use my 'rational brain' to think of why I did this but I'm struggling to.  My excuse for doing it was 'I was going to do it eventually', but I still don't think that's a great reason why I did.  I guess I just wish this obsessive side of me wasn't there, I feel like these urges sabotage my mood and it's difficult to see why I'm doing it why I'd even want to know.  Idk. 
Does	sober?	Does anyone else feel resentful at their spouse as their sobriety continues? I wonder sometimes if I drank so I could STAY married.  Sober, I look at him far too often and think, jesus.  You are a PAIN in the ASS.  He was a big catalyst in me getting sober.  Perhaps I'm resenting him for that? Maybe this is just a normal part of getting sober? 
I	today!	I am so excited to finally hit triple digits! The first 30 days felt like 6 months - it's been a struggle and a lot of hard work - this has been a battle for 20 years - seriously started to work on it 3 years ago.   I've never gotten this far - and I never thought I would actually enjoy being sober.   Fact is, I am a better mother, wife, worker all around person.   NO - life's not perfect but everyday gets better.   This sub has made all the difference.   I read it every night. . . thank you!  Looking forward for the next 100!  I won't drink with any of you today! 
I	life	I thought This was gonna get easier after a while but I started to be getting really depressed some days ago and I feel like its just getting worse and worse. Is this still withdrawal or does that mean that I actually depressed and weed cured me? Because I think I'd rather be addicted to weed than have to feel like this for the rest of my life
A	day.	A lot has happened since my last go at quitting.  .  .  Grandma was just diagnosed with Stage 3 lung cancer and we don't know how long she has.  You think that'd be enough to get me to quit, but addiction is funny like that. The 15 days I was successfully quit were the happiest 15 days I have felt since I was a child.  I was singing, dancing, breathing, smelling everything, smiling, going to the gym.  .  .  then sadness and depression shoved me off course.  How did this happen? How was I so resigned to slipping back into the life of feeling dirty, coughing, smelling bad, unable to breathe, lethargic, on edge, shaky, smoking?Am I assigning blame for my unhappiness to a habit? Probably. Is that a way of dodging accountability? Definitely. Perhaps it makes it easier to disappoint people when you can just blame your addiction. Pardon me for rambling on.  Thank you to everyone who encouraged me before, and thank you in advance for encouraging me now.  You are all such a wonderfully inspiring group (even the user who told me that I hadn't accomplished anything great after 5 days!). Have a wonderful rest of your day. 
It's	her.	It's a theme I've seen repeatedly here, and I've just remembered Nmother doing exactly that on at least one occasion.  I can't remember why (I think it was something to do with me, I hope I'd just torn her a new one haha), I just remember me leaving the kitchen where she was, looking back and seeing her collapsing and breathing heavily.  Me and my brother went to help her up, even though I'm pretty sure I realised even at the time she was faking it, although knowing me I would have been pretty concerned anyway, just in case she wasn't.  Of course she was magically fine when we got her on her feet.  If that was a victory to her, good for her, I guess. . . I don't know whether to be grateful or not that I can only partially remember what happened half the time when I lived with her. 
It's not OCD	they're not considered obsessive and intrusive	It's actually kind of embarrassing.  If someone catches me at it I usually have trouble remembering what the heck I was saying.   Sometimes I just wish my mind could be calm and not repeating the same thing over and over.  <e1> It's not OCD </e1>  because  <e2> they're not considered obsessive and intrusive </e2> .  It's just a loop, speeding by.  Sometimes saying nasty, destructive, things.  This has to eventually affect your self-esteem. Edit: Example, The other day my body was physically screaming in pain from doing too much yard work and I caught myself unconsciously repeating, If you want to be skinny just keep moving.   Like wtf!
i	.	i was at my brother's birthday party last night and my family started joking on about how it would be good if i died, and how funny it would be.  this went on for what seems like forever and i cant get it out of my mind.  i talked to my psychiatrist this morning and she didnt say much other than it's stupid. any advice on how to deal with this? my family knows about my (tw) suicidal ideation as well, which makes things worse.  trying hard to not regress to self-destructing but the emotions are very strong. . . . 
my last chance to make a moveBut I won't	that's just who I am	The last day of class to see that beautiful girl who sits next to me sometimes and  <e1> my last chance to make a moveBut I won't </e1>  because  <e2> that's just who I am </e2> .  It's easier to imagine happiness with someone than be disappointed by trying to make it a reality, and inevitably failing
When	are)??	When people know you have depression and ask how you're doing what do you usually answer? Do you keep it vague? Do you answer honestly and say you're suicidal (if you are)?? 
Anyone	weight	Anyone else ever feel like they just want to vanish, disappear or fadeaway for a bit.  Like everything's just weighing down on you and you're alone to burden it, just going away for a little while, not for good would even be nice, to get rid of the weight 
I	go.	I wish I had a better way to express it.  I wish there was someone who I could talk to without hurting.  I wish I wasn't so afraid of dying while still wanting to pass.  I wish I stuck to a simpler life and I wish I knew where I should be. I feel like I occupy space.  I don't feel like I affect my surroundings but I know if I pass, I'd hurt so many people.  I tired of just waiting for me to kill myself, I can't keep doing this. I just want to go. 
It's	clean.	It's like I've been either high or withdrawing or in that weird phase after withdrawing but before feeling good, I've been one of those 3 for the last 8 months and it's really taken a toll on me socially, I have a lot less friends and the ones I do have I don't even connect with, me and my gf just broke up and she was the only person I was really close to and she was faithful and really hot like I probably can't get a girl that good looking ever again which is kind of depressing I mean she could be a bitch sometimes but we connected and we were close, I just feel like my life sucks.  I see all these happy people doing things together and living life enjoying things and I'm just miserably depressed and can barely even get out of bed everyday, I'm using low doses and suboxone right now and I'm quitting and withdrawing again in 3 days then to rehab 2 weeks later, boy do I hope all this changes once I have a few months clean.  
Hi	today!!	Hi everyone and happy Thursday.   Just wanted to offer a boost of support to all for strength in the struggle to stay free--be strong. Not today!!
So	point	So my two homies and I are out smoking in front of this bar when this dude comes out of nowhere and asks for a cigarette.  We oblige, and he continues to talk about how he's embarrassed to ask when he has no change to offer.  Of course this isn't an issue with us - mostly I just want to ask him if he is okay because this kid is. . .  *intense*. He continues on about his life.  Bad experiences with local drug dealers, just turned 21 and got a DUI, semi-homeless because. . .  something about his mom filing a restraining order against him? I tried to let him know I relate to a lot of his experiences - my life is kinda crazy right now, haha.  He mentioned he was going to run for president at one point
but	hit	but i didnt. .  i woke up. .  feeling very surreal and detached  had a bad couple of days, started to get back right with myself with therapy and a rehab course but all taking too long. . too many hurdles. .  too many things wrong, too slowdont even know why im on here either. .  i posted something before and got nice feedback. .  maybe thats why. .  family dont deal with me well, friends are few and in similar boats. . wierd feeling being awake when less than 24 hours ago i was happy and willing to do something horrendous without any proper thought. .   didnt even contemplate what i was doing even when the high hit
I	tinnitus?!	I just had a thought.  Now that I am down to a very low dose (0. 75g) I've noticed that my tinnitus which started a few months ago is - touch wood - abating a little.  I didn't ever really make the connection, but do you think that Kratom causes tinnitus?!
The	annoying.	The state I live in requires you to go to the damn doc every single month to get a physical prescription.  Then you have to bring it to the pharmacy.  They will not let you fill a CS before 30 days exactly of the previous month.  I understand this, but it's incredibly inconvenient when you live in the city.  My pharmacy is across the city and I take the train, so I basically just never have enough for the last day of the 30 days.  Hence why I'm not doing anything today haha.  Anyone else have annoying shit like this happen every month? It's already annoying af that I have to go to the doc when they are only open during the same business hours I work.  I'm forced to miss a couple hours of work every month which is also annoying.    
Pretty	today)	Pretty happy about the milestone.   Just want to say thanks to everyone here.   Credit where it's due.   You guys rock!  I strongly feel like this place, even more than the dozens of AA meetings I've attended, has been instrumental in this.   Not only am I stopped (at least for the 90 previous days and today)
I was still with girls	I felt like thats what was SUPPOSED to be	So this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.  For the last 10-15 years I have felt myself slowly fall deeper and deeper into depression.  I feel like Im not myself.  Like Im trying to live up to who I once was when I was young.  I had such direction.  I knew who I was and what I wanted.  I was in love.  But that all started to go away.  I was just being dragged through life.  My drive gone.  The feeling of love, gone.   <e1> I was still with girls </e1>  because  <e2> I felt like thats what was SUPPOSED to be </e2> .  Fast forward to now and I find out from my doctor that I have SEVERELY low testosterone and that this may have been going on the whole time.  I dont need to be going to therapy twice a week.  I didnt need to be on those antidepressants.  I didnt need any of that.  I just need testosterone therapy.  I am fine.  I am just sick.  Physically
I'm not outside right now	I'm so hungry (probably from not being stoned all day)	Another long-time daily smoker looking to quit.  I have a lot of reasons. . . I'll be starting my Master's in a couple of months, and am aiming to pursue my doctorate afterwards.  I'm also trying to find jobs working with kids.  I live in Denver, so temptation is all around me.  I made it until about three today before dabbing, and was incredibly productive.  The only reason  <e1> I'm not outside right now </e1>  is because  <e2> I'm so hungry (probably from not being stoned all day) </e2> . I don't really want to quit cold turkey; I was thinking about saving it until I've accomplished everything I've done, and then reducing night time usage to little / none.  
I will actually begun to cry	it feels so real	Just curious to see if anyone else does.   I will act out a fantasy of a conversation I want to happen (usually in the car or shower or in a mirror), sometimes positive but can be negative.   These are usually centered around a boy I like who confesses how I've changed his life and how he loves me (lol) or me getting hurt/attacked and that boy saving me.   But they have also been intense, like me getting a call saying a family member is dead and  <e1> I will actually begun to cry </e1>  because  <e2> it feels so real </e2> .   Sometimes I have urges to have these convos and will isolate myself in my room so no one sees or hears me.   I'll also pace too and say the same lines over and over again.   Just wanted to know if anyone else can relate.  Kinda feeling like a weirdo right now and feel like hearing your stories. 
I'm excited to get to 7 days	if I can make it to there I know that I can do anything	Today is my first official day of my fight to stay sober.  I've been drinking heavily for years, as a functional alcoholic.  It has ruined relationships, put my life and well being in danger and if I don't stop now I know my life will be over in a matter of years. Many people would never know I was an alcoholic.  I'm a happy, healthy looking young woman who always shows up to work with a smile on my face.  I think part of the reason I started to drink is to help with boredom or to stop thinking about the bad things that had happened to me.  Now its to forget the things I hate in life, and also to numb the physical pain of a back injury. I'm doing this not just for my sake, or for my health.  I have people around me that I love that have been affected by my behavior and I want to be the person I used to be that they all miss.  <e1> I'm excited to get to 7 days </e1> , because  <e2> if I can make it to there I know that I can do anything </e2> .  
It's	encouragement.	It's easier if I just get straight to the point. . .  How do I tell my parents about my depression? I'm nervous about telling them and I feel I need some advice and words of encouragement. 
i	enough	i am happy enough
I	one.	I can't think of a different title.  I realized yesterday morning that I have a problem.  I can't manage when I'm sad or upset or just not happy without drinking.  I'm a 21 year old male and I've been drinking for the past year.  After I turned 21 last September I didn't control how much I drank, which might be fairly normal for that age in college, but I found myself drinking to forget.  Then drinking to kill any feelings of sadness I had.  Then drinking to avoid problems.  Now, I've realized that I can't experience anything without having a drink.  And when things do get sad for me emotionally, I can't experience these emotions without binge drinking.  I love alcohol, and it's ingrained into the culture I've grown up in.  I'm not at the point where I can say I'm an alcoholic, but I can definitely see that if this continues I'll become one.  How do I separate alcohol from experience? I can't think of a time in the last eight months when I didn't have a drink when it was appropriate to have one. 
he thought it was suspicious	he said he wants to talk to us (my brother and I)	My brother and I needed to take sometime off work tomorrow because my mother got in a car accident so we need to take care of her.  So we both texted our boss at the same time and  <e1> he thought it was suspicious </e1>  so  <e2> he said he wants to talk to us (my brother and I) </e2> .  Now, thinking I was texting my brother, I actually texted my boss saying damn it I knew it would look bad
I	alone.	I have a lot  moments where I  contemplate suicide.  I truly feel that I do want to but I stay strong and don't do it.  I get mixed feelings of deep sandness and cover them up with frustration and anger.   I just want to go on a rampage and go out with a bang.    I have openly expressed this feelings with others.  But I really want to stop dealing with this dark emotions I feel each morning.  I am very afraid this will continue with the rest of my life.   That's what kills me the most.  So I am going in a hike this Sunday in  search of some peace even though I am going alone.   
I just got so emotional	my angel fish looked lonely	 <e1> I just got so emotional </e1>  because  <e2> my angel fish looked lonely </e2> , so i got another one and they instantly started swimming together and looked really happy to be together.  Now it makes me so emotional to see them together, its overwheling. 
I	cycle	I am sleepy but not tired.  This is a big thing for me.  Some nights I'm tired but not sleepy.  I require both to sleep.  I've always had difficulty falling asleep.  If I go to sleep late, I will wake late.   then I cannot fall asleep until even later than last night, and it's a vicious cycle
TGIF!!I	planned?	TGIF!!I am at 30 days.  WTF?! I am so happy to be here!Going to some meetings later this weekend and also gonna relax and work on my meditation.  What does everyone have planned?
I thought I'd weigh in here	my situation has been pretty notable	Guys, I have quit both benzos and SSRIs cold turkey in the past but nicotine takes the lead for most difficult/consuming to quit. . .  <e1> I thought I'd weigh in here </e1>  as  <e2> my situation has been pretty notable </e2> ! After realising I'd been addicted to nicotine for over half my life, I seemed to suddenly have a complete change of mindset and now here I am two weeks in. . . I've had near constant dizziness/vertigo, I've been cold to the bone, my lypmh nodes are swollen, my throat and chest are always tight, I'm coughing, I'm hyper-irritable, I'm foggy/not thinking straight, I'm craving junk food (which I rarely ever eat), I'm lethargic, I'm achey but I'm NAILING IT. I spent nearly a quarter of my life going between gums/lozenges/eCigarettes until I finally realised that it is ALL or NOTHING for me.  And that's fine.  For some it just is. If I was to give any bit of general advice that's helped me. . . Stay motivated! It is you who has the final say, not the addiction.  Step back and witness it, embrace it, own it! And give yourself a tonne of slack - it's only temporary. 
Hi	ugly	Hi everyone.  I've decided to make the step to see a therapist/psychologist.  Problem is, I have no idea who or what to see. I think I have some low form of anxiety? I saw my school therapist once and she said she could see signs of anxiety in me.  I overthink things to death, my mind is constantly running and overthinking and thinking about the future and what ifs and regrets and I just can't handle it anymore.  When I'm in school I completely shut down from the stress and push people away, leading me to feel more alone.  I constantly worry about my grades, what I'm going to do in the future, if I'll end up alone, if things I'm going through are ormal and I want to stop overthinking and just live. In addition to this my self confidence isn't great and I just went through a bad breakup so I'd like to talk about that too.  I feel ugly
I've	times	I've been seriously trying to quit gaming since November of 2016.  Took me a long time of installing and uninstalling games, binging porn, a lot of really sad days where i thought i would never change.   Finally on February 3rd i told myself i would never play again I've heard those words way too many times
When	hahaha	When I was first diagnosed (earlier this year) and getting treatment I was meeting with my pdoc going over my medicine.  I had been on it for a few weeks and she was asking about any side effects I was noticing.  I said Everything is going good but I'm super gassy.  After her giving me a weird ass look she said Uhmm I'm sorry that is not a side effect.  I was so fucking embarrassed hahaha 
i will forever be angry	she turned my father against me and farewell	Sorry for the rant but i need to say this to someone, even if it is just a random stranger on the internet. Today after a 2 month break from communicating with my mother she sent me a text message saying she and my father was tired of this, this is my last chance and then proceeded to call me rotten, all in the same 4 line message. So i did it, i replied to her telling her how rotten she has been and manipulative, that  <e1> i will forever be angry </e1>  that  <e2> she turned my father against me and farewell </e2> .  Then i sent a farewell message to my father who i genuinely like. More was said obviously but that was the gist of the message to her, it feels so weird to have said it and cut ties with them.  I am also afraid she will turn back on her words and try to keep in touch but for now i am happy and sad at the same time.  
I've been told I'm generally healthy for the most part	to me this is really scary	I suffer from GAD and hypochondria.  I had a 24 hour holter monitor put on, some time back and just got the results and now I'm freaking out.  I had an abnormal result, under Sepraventricular Ectopy and my resting heart rate is at 95.   <e1> I've been told I'm generally healthy for the most part </e1>  so  <e2> to me this is really scary </e2> .  Apparently I had rare ventricular ectopic beats with no VT.  I am so scared.  I'm freaking out and having vision problems.  I want to cry I am so scared.  Is anyone around to help me calm down? Does anyone have any knowledge about this kind of stuff? My doctor explained what he could but also referred me to a cardiologist.  I'm so scared of heart disease.  Help? 
Salons are very appearance orientated	that makes me so anxious with my bad looks	I am on planning on going to the salon tomorrow or soon and i  am freaking out already.  I really hate hair salons and the environment.  I had some bad experiences there and fear it will happen again.  I am objectively ugly so i already know  how they will look at me.   I plan to bring my mom with me at least to make it easier but i am still terrified.  I do not want to make small talk, i do not want to see myself in the mirror (i always look down or anywhere but the mirror), i don't want other customers looking at me/judging me.  I have low self esteem and always have to look down.  My heart pounds incredibly and I get shaky if anyone even looks at me for a second.  <e1> Salons are very appearance orientated </e1>  and  <e2> that makes me so anxious with my bad looks </e2> , but my hair is bothering me its so tangled with split ends and just looks in bad shape. Does anyone else feel similar of going to hair salons? what helped you?
I tried hanging myself, and I don't like the feeling.  Cutting my wrists makes me cringe just thinking about it.  Not going through the hassle of buying a gun	I guess I'm just going to get on my bike, and ride a couple miles where some train tracks are	 <e1> I tried hanging myself, and I don't like the feeling.  Cutting my wrists makes me cringe just thinking about it.  Not going through the hassle of buying a gun </e1> .  So  <e2> I guess I'm just going to get on my bike, and ride a couple miles where some train tracks are </e2> .  I'll cry and wait for the train to come.  I'll get hit.  And then I'm free of pain.  Edit: Why are people down voting? What did I ever do to you?
Exactly	yeah	Exactly a week ago I told my mom that my dad's gun in the living room was triggering bad thoughts, suicidal thoughts.  They rushed to my room and they got the gun, my dad told me I was being stupid and asking for attention, acting like a child. Today my mom took me to my very first psychiatrist.  The doctor diagnosed me with severe depression and gave me medication and asked for a bunch of tests. When I got home, my mom, dad and I started to talk about the experience, and mom said yeah
com/vQcd4vHJust	beer.	 com/vQcd4vHJust want to give everyone some hope in their journey to sobriety.  I started 73 days ago, it wasn't easy.  I went from 2 40s of St Ides a night (1. 5 years) to 5 days a week at the gym and coaching my HS lacrosse team.  P. S.  I didn't notice any crazy withdrawal symptoms, just being really depressed out of nowhere for a week like a month in, but I wasn't pounding hard liquor either just shitty beer. 
I	here	I feel awful for my past mistakes but I know I can't change my past and I'm always afraid of what things could happen. Its like a constant reminder of what I did wrong anxiety is like;Oh look you screwed up here
If	daughter?	If my mom had it her way, my sister and I wouldn't exist.  My brother, on the other hand, is God's gift to the world.  Her misogyny is blatant and obvious.  She has been furious at us girls for existing since birth. I see a lot of this on this sub. Is this how all families are? I've wondered if it's because most human societies historically have been somewhat polygamous, so almost all women would get a shot at reproducing, but only some men would, so it would make more sense to love your sons and neglect your daughters to increase the chances that they're one of the fewer men reproducing. makes sense to allot more of your resources towards the kids who are gonna have harder competition. My nmom doesn't just neglect us, though.  She actually goes to great lengths to stalk and terrorize us. Are any of you in situations where the GC isn't the son and the SG isn't the daughter?
Title	SD!!!	Title says it mostly.  Today will be 30 days without a drop, the longest I've been sober in probably 5+ years.  All I want to do is shout it from the roof tops, celebrate this milestone, etc.  Alas it feels to vain, to loud, to personal to post on Facebook or something.  I feel so much better.  So much clearer! I needed to do this a while ago, but denial is a strong force.  30 days down and I'll tackle the rest 1 at a time!I will not drink with you today SD!!!
So	this.	So my mom called last month and got super passive aggressive with me about ~family~ and my graduation party.  I was in the thick of mid-terms so I hadn't done much planning, and she dramatically announced she wasn't going to do anything for my graduation.  Cue now, a week before my graduation.  She's planning a dinner at a family-style restaurant (every takes from plates in the middle of the table) with my cousins to celebrate my graduation.  She didn't tell me any of the details and tbh I'm just trying to avoid drama so I don't care free food, right? I assume she remembers that I'm vegetarian.  Nope.  Her response to the family style menu with a lack of veg options is You're the only one you can just eat potatoes. . .  at my party. . .  that she tried to use to manipulate me into contacting family that hasn't reached out to me even after I sent Christmas cards. . .  fuck this.  
So	cycle	So my anxiety always leads to a hypochondria type thing.  I start feeling anxious and then I start thinking I'm verging on heart attack.  I know it's just anxiety, but it's tough to convince myself I'm not facing imminent death.   I'm overweight and I smoke.  So that fuels the fire.  My heart rate is up around 115 at the moment, normally hovers around 80 or less.  I need to stop checking my pulse though I know that's a bad habit.  No chest pains, no numbness no shortness of breath.  No symptoms at all really, just sweating, but it's way hotter today than it has been the last week so that's probably why.  And the heart rate of course.  If I were to have a heart attack it would have been when I was riding my bike this afternoon right? I just ate, 3 hours ago I had a butt load of coffee.  Like a pot.   So rationally I know that that's probably why my heart rate is so high.  I had an aspirin just in case.  I know I'm just feeling anxiety, It's just the anxiety makes me think heart attack and that just fuels the anxiety.  Vicious cycle
When	that	When I say or do certain things, people are taking them the wrong way.  I'm misunderstood, and my intentions behind certain things I say or do apparently don't come across.  Examples: There's this woman at work (a grocery store) who is the kindest woman ever.  She lost her son to a chronic disease about ten years ago, and I think she's so strong for handling that.  I feel like people don't appreciate her and her kindness.  So at work, we had early opening shifts.  I offered to buy her a donut every now and then.  Within time, she said something to me and added as friends.  As if I had been hitting on her this entire time.  As if I was being a creeper.  I don't blame her for thinking that
At	planet.	At a certain point, you kinda just know you and what behavior you have in you. I read about people like Elon Musk and Richard Branson.  I see some of my really hard working friends.  And I just don't see that in me.  Which is tremendously heartbreaking when I would love to join the world class and be a peak performer. I've tried.  God knows, I've tried.  I'll have two days of focus.  But on the third day, I'm incredibly burnt out. I know I'm supposed to do things gradually.  Ease my way into it.  Cut a lot of distraction out.  But it's just not working out.  I'm almost 27.  I feel like I already blew my one life on this planet. 
I	again	I have this year long research essay I have to do if I want to keep studying next year.  I've never done anything like it before, and the department expects me to be very involved and in touch with them while I do it - like deadlines we need to keep that form part of the grade.  And it's really messing with my social anxiety, it's a really small department and all the lecturers intimidate me.  Everyone gets a supervisor they're supposed to liaise with.  I have my first deadline on Monday, I don't know who my supervisor is, I don't know if they forgot about me or if I was supposed to approach someone earlier but it's too late now.  I'm worried they're just going to think I'm a slacker for not getting in touch.  I wish I could talk to someone in the department about my social anxiety but a) I'm way too nervous to even approach them, and b) I'm worried if I do, they won't believe me and just write it off as me making excuses and that I just need to suck it up.  I'm going to start seeing my therapist again
I'm completely losing hope and I'm really feeling that  I've reached my end	it scares me but also give me a sense of calm	 <e1> I'm completely losing hope and I'm really feeling that  I've reached my end </e1> ,  <e2> it scares me but also give me a sense of calm </e2> .  I lied and screwed up a lot of things and killing myself seems now like a inevitable option,  I don't feel like I deserve to live. I don't have access to pills or any medicines, I thought about the train or the highway but I don't want to burden my death on even more people, most likely it will be by hanging.  I know I have loving family members, I know what it will do to them.  I know there is medical help if I asked but  all I can think of is death and that I don't want to feel any more guilt.  Tomorrow is my birthday and how ironic my death would be on such a date.  If someone has survived their suicide attempt, would you please describe to me your mental state and thought leading up to it.  The only comfort I have now is to read other peoples stories, to not feel so alone. /a hopeless degenerate. 
I	Goodbye.	I am being institutionalised in a few hours, I am currently meant to be under strict supervision but I'll be fine.  I avoided a 1013 which I am proud of.  Everyone is calm.  I am residing.  Soon everything will be okay but I don't know how or which form it will be as.  Hopefully I can say goodbye again without my life ending; but that won't change the fact that I am ready and still wanting to die.  Thank you for listening, I truly appreciate it all.  Goodbye. 
Hi,Its	situation.	Hi,Its been around 5 months since i went cold turkey .  I was on around 36 ish tramadol a day and tho the most of the physical symptoms have gone i think , i'm still struggling its like everything has changed for the better but i just feel like nobody understands how i feel when i feel it .  I still don't know what normal is and im still finding it hard to keep my head up high.  I spent 3 year isolating myself from a woman who only wanted the best for me and people around me .  I just want to be the person i was before all of this before my back pain and before i questioned pain .  I still find bruises and cuts on my body each day just from being careless i guess but i don't seem to notice when it happens.  I happy to say im not depressed i look forward to the future now im just confused . . . . . .  Could anybody help me shed some light on the situation. 
I've	me	I've seen two therapists before and the first was disinterested.  The second damaged my hopes of ever finding help.  He was blatantly rude and disinterested in hearing what I had to say.  He didn't like me from the getgo and that was clear. As to the one I saw: She was absolutely pleasant.  She cared, and listened and let my mind wander mostly. But I got to talk to someone and got to tell them the things I can tell noone and explain why I can tell noone.  I got to confess to the things I know, and the things I expect. I was afraid but I was desperate.  Things were getting bleak.  I tend to think of the decision to commit suicide as 11:55 or 12:02.  For me
Hi,so	progress	Hi,so I've been depressed pretty much all my life, at least since I have been 6 years old.  When I was 17 it got clinical, you all can imagine what followed.  I am doing all I can every day, but often it's not much. Anyway.  My question is: Do you know anyone who has become ok even when they were older? I sometimes think I am making progress
so	with	so im a 16 year old guy from estonia, studying to be an IT in a vocational training Center (basically a slower gymnasium), ever since i got overweight in 3rd grade ive lost all my friends therefore go outside maybe few times a month with my parents, i have some friends but they only hang out with me if they are really really bored and noone else to hang out with
As	all.	As a member of r/opiates I find myself disgusted on Reddit multiple times a day.   The triggers are real on that sub, but I can say unsubscribing from there and subscribing here was a big step in my recovery.   That ks for being here everyone.   I wish the best to all. 
I	up	I haven't gone to the doctor yet about subs. .  I'm super afraid to go now.  If Obama care is repealed and insurance companies can discriminate against high risk and pre existing conditions I'm sure having opiate addict on your record is basically a death sentence due to the health risks and mortality rates.  What do you guys do? Pay out of pocket without insurance and try to hide it from your records? I'm stuck.  I want to get on subs but if it fucks the rest of my life up
I think I'm more nervous	not having that simple solution to everyrhing	I've been smoking weed since I was a teenager and I love it.  My girlfriend and I used to dab together on a daily basis.  Now she's pregnant, and I need to get my shit together and find a career so I can support her and my baby.  My most solid option right now is getting my CDL and becoming a commercial driver. I've been using weed as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, anxiety, and anger issues and I'm unsure of how I'm going to be able to deal with these things without it.  I'm not sure if it's the fact that I'm no longer going to be high that's the issue for me,  <e1> I think I'm more nervous </e1>  about  <e2> not having that simple solution to everyrhing </e2> .  I won't be able to just say fuck it
Quinine	else.	Quinine is used to treat RLS/leg cramps, but usually in higher doses than what's in in tonic water.  Still, drinking a cup or so at night before sleeping has helped me immensely, and I'm curious if it works for anyone else.  
Just finally got released from hospital	I'm inconsolable	My ex (now) boyfriend called the cops when I wouldn't leave after an argument and being a drunken mess I threatened to kill myself.  I wasn't suicidal, I was drunk as and it was attention seeking.   <e1> Just finally got released from hospital </e1> .  <e2> I'm inconsolable </e2> .   I've ruined everything from drinking and hate myself.  I don't know how to stop when my anxiety is this through the roof.  He's blocked me which I understand.  How do you get help when you've hit rock bottom? Drinking seems like the only way to numb this pain.  But me drinking also caused this. 
I don't tend to feel depressed	my mind is racing so fast it doesn't dwell on any particular emotion	There are definitely bad parts to it.  It makes it more difficult for me to engage with society and creates a deep feeling of being an outsider.  BUT - when I'm properly medicated it makes me feel like I have superpowers.  I can 'see' things better than other people - like, I am better at understanding things.  My brain is quicker - I can take in information quickly and spot logical flaws before anybody else.  I'm more willing to take risks.   <e1> I don't tend to feel depressed </e1>  because  <e2> my mind is racing so fast it doesn't dwell on any particular emotion </e2> .  What used to make me feel depressed was when I didn't know why I was the way I was.  But now I know it's ADHD and I'm able to curtail the extremes, I honestly feel like I have an incredibly special gift - even if it makes some aspects of life a little bit harder. I know a lot of people don't feel this way and I don't want to minimise the challenges that ADHD can present, but I wanted to share my perspective about how ADHD really does offer some striking advantages. 
she's an old cat she's started to go senile and now doesn't seem to recognize me at all	It's heartbreaking and I don't know what to cling to anymore	What kept me going for the past seven or so years since I developed depression was my cat.  She loved coming to sit with me and was always really friendly and excited to see me in the morning or when I got home.  Now that I've been going to university for two years I haven't been able to see her much, and since  <e1> she's an old cat she's started to go senile and now doesn't seem to recognize me at all </e1> .   <e2> It's heartbreaking and I don't know what to cling to anymore </e2> . Sorry, I just needed to vent. 
Hi,	it!	Hi, This is my first time at this sub.  Sorry if this isn't what you normally are allowed to post.  My girlfriend has had anxiety since before we meet, but it's been getting worse recently.  She's broken down at work and she also got prescribed emergency medication.  I know there's no easy fix and I'm not looking for that, but I would like to know as a significant other what can I do to help, or at least try to help.   Right now I've just been talking to her to try and help her relax.  I ask her to tell me what happened and she explains what she thinks caused the attack.  Is that the right thing I should have her do? Obviously everyone is different, but I just need a little guidance.  I don't want to do something to make it worse.  Thank you for taking time to read this I really appreciate it! 
Yeah,	place	Yeah, so, can't remember if I've written of this before, but I'm currently in inpatient care at a local psych ward, and the doctor here seems to doubt the diagnosis my usual doctor did, which was apparently schizophrenia.  The nurses here doubt too, and I've been through some psychologist's tests; on the 16th we will see how I fare.  If it's schizophrenia or something else completely. I probably won't be abandoning this sub, even if they tell me I'm just depressed with occational psychotic episodes.  I've been on r/depression long enough to know that it is a toxic place
Whenever	edgy	Whenever I tell someone I'm depressed no one believes me.  They all joke about how I'm depressed and suicidal and think I'm just trying to be cool and edgy
He takes some medication	I've been patient	My brother monopolizes the PS4, simulating NBA 2K games. We can't interrupt a game no matter what.  (1hour for an entire match) He simulates ALL teams, the whole season + playoffs, then write down the results, he doesn't even watch the games! <e1> He takes some medication </e1>  so  <e2> I've been patient </e2> , but this is seriously getting on my nerve, it has always been like that; not sure I'm in the right subreddit, but why can I do ?How to get rid of this?
i'm always terrified	when other people get mad at me, they'll take things away from me, or not want to speak with me	as an adult i'm always awed that i have my own things and they can't be taken away.   <e1> i'm always terrified </e1>  that  <e2> when other people get mad at me, they'll take things away from me, or not want to speak with me </e2> .  having my own things in my own home is so so strange! it's mine and no one can take it? what a strange concept.  it's been years but i'm still shocked lol
just to show them that they were the cause	hate	for someone who's introverted, i sure do depend on validation from other people a lot.  i can slowly see the people i consider close stop caring about me.   ive been suicidal for a while and this isnt helping.  it feels like people just dont care about me anymore.  its come to the point where i dont know if i want to kill myself because of my depression or if i want to kill myself just to spite them.   <e1> just to show them that they were the cause </e1> .   i  <e2> hate </e2>  that im thinking like this.  i shouldnt start to hate my own friends, but i cant help it when it feels like they dont care about me anymore 
I couldn't even speak up in my own language	embarrassed and scared	I have a first appointment with a new psychiatrist tomorrow.  Last time I went, it was in a different country and didn't get any therapy (they recommended hospitalization, even without knowing the whole story), but this time I probably will.    This time I would like to be completely honest, and tell them about my suicidal thoughts and attempts.   The problem is,  <e1> I couldn't even speak up in my own language </e1> , I am so terribly  <e2> embarrassed and scared </e2> .  I'm not even sure if I should tell them, but it might be the only way for me to get better.   Anybody have any advice?  
It	.	It seems the assumption is that nobody could be tired of life and want to end it unless they are depressed but I'm really doubting that conclusion.  Some people just dont like life, myself being one of them.   Can someone explain why it's assume that it's always a medical issue.  Some peoples' lives actually just suck. . . . .  
God	.	God damn it! Was 3 weeks clean, again, then last 2 weekends I used Fri/Sat/Sun because bullshit excuses.  Last dose was yesterday morning, 8g OPMS Maley. . .  not feeling super bad today but not super good either: yawning a lot, little fatigue, I really hope I didn't fuck myself up for another week of miserable WD. . .  and I told myself I wouldn't binge on weekends again after the 5 weekend binges in a row.  Damn it!  How bad you think I'll feel after 3 weeks clean, 3 day weekend, 5 days clean, 3 day weekend? Can't honestly remember how I felt a week ago. . .  
Having	worse.	Having a shit night of sleep where I take forever to fall asleep to wake up with the driest of eyes on the planet as I try forcefully yawning to get those things some moisture as I get ready for classes.  I walk outside to have my eyes feel like I am getting stung by a billion needles, all in while grumpy as hell and my resting face is already kind of not too happy in this state, but having my eyes burning like there's salt being poured on them makes things way worse.  
I	help.	I work at a school as a teaching assistant, and suffer with depression and anxiety.  Recently my anxiety has developed the added complication of panic attacks.  All of a sudden, with nothing in particular setting it off, I'll feel like I've just run a marathon and struggle to catch my breath.   I'm still very much new to the whole thing, and I'm not really sure what to do when one hits beside leave the room and take a few minutes to calm down.  I was wondering if anyone had any sort of coping mechanisms for it, something I could use to make them slightly less of a problem to the teachers I'm helping out.   Thanks for any help.  
excited	be in control	Has been the most difficult 19 hours in long time.  I've been non stop reading everything I could in this sub to keep me going.  I'm  <e1> excited </e1>  to  <e2> be in control </e2> .      I feel confident, thank you for the stories and the encouragement I read everywhere here.  Update soon!   EDIT: Made it and going strong! 
I've	24/7	I've reached a point in my life where I want to be with someone again yet my situation right now doesn't allow that option.  It's so difficult.  There are a few guys I flirt with at work and I know nothing is going to happen between either one of them.  One definitely can't and the other is too different from me to really be interested.  It's just hard to play this game that I like so much but I know it won't go anywhere.    Each time is more depressing than the last.  I won't be alone forever but I'm getting sick of being patient while I focus on myself when I still hate myself half the time.  Nobody wants someone with super low self-esteem and all that negativity 24/7 
Im	appreciated.	Im just curious if anybody else has had the same issue (I'm sure there are plenty) I'm about 3months completely smoke free, however my cravings are only getting stronger, not an hour goes by that i don't think about lighting one up and everyday its getting harder and harder to push the urge back into its box.  I was always under the assumption that by this point they should be getting less frequent.    Anybody have any advice they could share itd be much appreciated.   
I	all?	I seriously fucked up today.  Got expelled from school for being a dumbass.  Now because of this, I have to face my infiuriated parents and my dissapointed and angry prinicipal.   The problem is that my anxiety is holding me back from accepting it all.  I can't face my problems themselves, nor I can face those people.  I can only feel ashamed of myself and my stupidity.  I'm seriously fucking scared to accept it all.   How do I learn to finally accept and face it all? 
I	minor?	I know I'm not the only one who struggles to make friends and suffers from depression yet I can't help but feel the same crippling loneliness and isolation.  And I know for a fact at least one friend I have likes me, yet I don't know why I'm so depressed.  Why am I so depressed if my problem is so minor? 
tired	living, and trying and nothing ever changing	I'm so  <e1> tired </e1>  of  <e2> living, and trying and nothing ever changing </e2> .  I go further and further into my depression, and when I try to climb out, I end up falling down further.  I can't afford therapy, or a hospital.  I can barely afford meds.  I don't know, I don't want to do this anymore.  I'm done.   
what is so hard about your life	depressed	They didn't care at all.  I got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and  <e1> what is so hard about your life </e1>  that you are  <e2> depressed </e2>  and what to kill yourself?.   When I struggled with an eating disorder 
I	pains?	I am afraid of myself.  I am afraid of the future.  I genuinely feel like I've got nothing to look forward to.  I got tears streaming down my cheeks as I write this.   Whats the point of living life if every one good thing that happens equates to twenty hardships? I feel like Life can only get worse from here on.  I've thought so much about killing myself.  I'm not sure why I would desperately fight so hard, being so sad, only to race to death.  Why not just embrace it and avoid dealing with growing pains? 
I've resorted to self harming by cutting in not obvious places	I feel empty and numb and it feels good to feel something	I blocked out the incident for 13 years, I was 14.  I had an unsuccessful suicide attempt after the incident involving sleeping pills.  It's come back in full swing the last few months.  I'm not coping.  Counselling hasn't been successful, I was diagnosed with PTSD, I'm on anti depressants.  Hour by hour is a struggle.   <e1> I've resorted to self harming by cutting in not obvious places </e1>  because  <e2> I feel empty and numb and it feels good to feel something </e2> .  It's getting harder to feel anything now though and suicide ideation has come back harder than ever.  I've lost interest in exercise and art, which was my life.  I'm reaching out for help and trying to do the right things but with no success.  I feel like an idiot.  I shouldn't be here.  
relieved and kind of excited	have found somewhere with so many people I could relate to	At first I was incredibly  <e1> relieved and kind of excited </e1>  to  <e2> have found somewhere with so many people I could relate to </e2> , somewhere to possibly start opening up to people.  But coming here often leaves me in a worse state than before.  I thought it would be easier to connect with people but there are just too many people I guess.  I don't know, whatever.   
sad	people treat people like this	As far as I know, I'm told my delusions aren't too too bad but they still exist.  I'm finding myself bullied and being called awful names and that I'm lying about things.  I guess I don't know what's going on and it makes me  <e1> sad </e1>   <e2> people treat people like this </e2> . . .  
In comparison I am alone and defective	hate, no, to despise the popula	I am alone, no friends, no aquaintances, only my parents, I go to college everyday but I'm just a ghost walking by the other students.  I often become paranoid feeling like whenever other people look at me, they see a friendless weirdo loser with no prospects in life--no future. While I'm walking alone down a street, it feels as though all passers-by are higher order, socially intelligent, fashionable people who effortlessly glide through life on a winged chariot of charm and charisma.   <e1> In comparison I am alone and defective </e1> , and very bitter about it.  I started to <e2>  hate, no, to despise the popula </e2> r people in all their blithe and breezy self-confidence.  I check Facebook 
Previous	sub.	Previous post: /how_to_explain_what_happened_in_therapy/  Sorting out the miscommunication took longer than I thought, we spent the whole session on that.  Long story short she had missed the importance of what put me on the track I'm on now and has kept me alive.  Yes, I'm being vague.  I don't want to be recognized, otherwise I would've posted a longer summary of my story.   And writing that gave me an idea of how to start writing.  We agreed that I'd write down what I can.  Might as well start with why I ended up in the situated that landed me in this sub.  
no way I can order it from USA or NZ	it's driving me nuts	Hello everyone! Just wondering if you know some preferably natural substances, herbs that are similar to kava kava in its anxiolytic effect?   I've never tried kava kava myself, but reviews and some clinical studies make it sound like a godsend for GAD - benzo-like effect without cognitive or other side effects even if used daily (noble kava) and not addictive, without rebound anxiety.  But in my country its illegal  <e1> no way I can order it from USA or NZ </e1> ,  <e2> it's driving me nuts </e2>  how stupid it is that I can only have ssris and benzos with lots of side effects and can't decide what I put in my body.  Sorry for ranting and possible mistakes.  Thanks for reading.    Anyone have some advice? 
I	that.	I thought I had stopped smoking for good until last night.  I got in the middle of an argument between my mom and (sort of) stepdad.  I shouldn't have got involved but seeing my mom cry like that broke something in me.  I got way too emotional and became a total wreck the rest of the night.  I actually asked my sister in law for a hit and she filled my bowl.  I took a hit and immediately felt guilty and worthless.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it but at the same time I knew it'd give me an escape from everything that had happened previously that night.  This morning I gave it back to my sister in law because I know I can't trust myself with it in my possession.  I couldn't even make it a week without smoking.  I feel ashamed,disappointed,and depressed that I'd let myself do that.  
Sometimes	grave.	Sometimes a mother's love is only conditional.  Conditions that a child can never meet.     Fuck Mother's Day.  Fuck everything about it.  It's always been a fucking train wreck of emotions for me but this year my train wreck is on fire filled with passengers.  My nmother died last year and I'm not mourning her.  I will always mourn the mother she could have and should have been to me.   I haven't slept right in days.  Making me miserable from the fucking grave.   
exhausting	alive	It's  <e1> exhausting </e1>  being  <e2> alive </e2> .  I want to kill myself.  How can I ever be happy  
scared	silence	Does anyone else have an Nmother who is so  <e1> scared </e1>  of  <e2> silence </e2>  that she literally fills up any pause in sound with insane humming/singing? Note: she has never been a singer or musician so that is not a reason.  Before I had gone No Contact, I took her to the hospital for an unrelated check up and she started doing it and ended up getting sedated per doctor's suggestion (I'm a bit ashamed that I find THAT part funny though it's really not funny!!). . . She also used to go back and forth between the humming/singing and talking to her dog- unfortunately, the doggy's passed on so now it's just the humming/singing.  Is this a somewhat normal N development or is she completely losing her marbles in some unrelated way? Personally, I'm thinking it has something to do with her inability to sit with just her thoughts.  
frustrating	I finally was at a place where I was really happy with my weight	I'm currently weaning off of fluoxetine (Prozac), and I've noticed I've been gaining an unusual amount of weight over the past few weeks.  It's super  <e1> frustrating </e1> , because  <e2> I finally was at a place where I was really happy with my weight </e2> .  If anything, I've been exercising more and eating better lately, and the gain lines up pretty closely with when I started reducing my meds.   Has anyone else dealt with this? How long did the gain last, and were you able to loose it again?  Edit: I was on a pretty low dosage, so it's only taking about a month to be totally off, and I'm almost there.  
I've	well	I've been depressed since age 1,5 (almost 21 now) it's always there but I like to think of it like the tides of the ocean, sometimes there's a low tide and I feel closer to normal and I'm generally happier than when there's a high tide and the depression really comes in strong.  During the low tide times I can handle myself well 
I	bottom.	I was born in 1998 so I can really only compare to the 2000s but 2014-2016 were by far the worst few years of my life.   For me 2017 has been pretty mellow, but I feel like my life is stagnating, there has been no ups or down just existence.  2010 was pretty bad, 2011 was ok,2012 was not that great and 2013 things got worse and 2014-2016 was rock bottom.   
Hello	her	Hello everyone!  I finally made an account just for this.  I'll keep my post short for the sake of not boring anyone.   About a year ago I started to get concerned with my porn/masturbation habits, and searched around reddit for a solution.  I promptly found r/nofap and started to get active in the community.  I had around 12 days of no mastrubation/porn before I relapsed and never looked back.   About a month ago I had similar issues in my life.  Spending an hour looking for the right video.  Mastrubating rather than going to the gym.  Weirder and weirder categories. .  What took me over the edge was a vacation I took with my girlfriend.  I am very attracted to her 
I	blocker.	I am ready to take the next step down in my taper and maybe skip my last end of day dose. . .  I read on here quite a bit about Black Seed Oil being very helpful and it arrived today.  Is it helpful at the 1 tsp twice a day as recommended or in higher or lower amounts?  Is it best to take it in lieu of a dose? I know we are all different but I would be grateful to hear your experience!  Edit: Took 2 tsps and cannot believe how well this stuff works.  I feel like I took a valium or a beta blocker.   
my last day of highschool tomorrow	excited	it's <e1>  my last day of highschool tomorrow </e1> .  I should be  <e2> excited </e2>  but i'm mostly panicking about the future ahead.  I'm trying my best to think positive but I've honestly had panic attacks about this for weeks now.  Wish me luck lol 
I	sound	I have good supports and people around me who care.  I still get these bursts of weirdness or however you'd call it, and impulses to do odd things that I know my family would disapprove of but I can hardly contain myself.  I should be grateful that I can restrain myself. . .  I know that.  But I can't help but feel somewhat resentful that I feel forced to contain it.  Sometimes I just want to point six speakers with three sounds at dog food so it can absorb the sound 
I haven't hurt myself	proud of myself right now	It's already May and I haven't cut at all this year!  I've been tempted, but I haven't done it!  I've been healthier, mentally, and it's really nice.  Even with weight gain.   <e1> I haven't hurt myself </e1>  and I am so fucking  <e2> proud of myself right now </e2> .  Like, good on me!  I never thought I'd get this far.  It's not like I don't get depressed or anxious.  I just feel free! 
My job is in insurance	mistakes are not a good thing	I've been slowly weaning myself off Adderall over the last 6 months or so based on a plan from my nutritionist in order to be off all meds before my husband and I start trying for a baby.  I am down from 30mg a day for 10 years to 10mg every other day.  This is my first week with no Adderall on alternating days and it's really starting to affect my work performance on those days.   I am less productive and am making more mistakes.   <e1> My job is in insurance </e1>  so  <e2> mistakes are not a good thing </e2> .   So far nothing too bad but I'm wondering if anyone else has quit taking it after so long and if you have any tips for coping with the change?  Any suggestions are appreciated! 
You	now.	You might be anybody, or nobody.   During the depression I am no one.    And when the strange things come, I become someone. . .  powerful.  Well, someone people tend to invest plots in.  They may be bad people but it's nice to put the ghost me to sleep.   I wonder if anyone else feels like a body.  Neither somebody or nobody, but just an empty vessel.  Someone who left long ago but doesn't know it.  And must continue to breathe.    I think I'm in the middle now.  
can eat anything spicy or dink alcoho	awful	Has anyone had acid reflux symptoms since quitting?  Last weekend I went deep sea fishing.  Associated the sickness to simple sea sickness at the time.  Well happened again, yesterday and today and I was no where near the sea.  I typically have absolutely NO issues and  <e1> can eat anything spicy or dink alcoho </e1> l with no issues.  Omg this is  <e2> awful </e2> .  It's mostly in my chest area and upwards.  Like my throat is closing up too.  I've had one bout with actual nausea as well.  Feels better to lay down though than sit up and can last for hours, lots of hours.  Any insight, suggestions, stories etc.  would be appreciated.  Started at about 5-6 weeks after quitting.   
night comes	suicidal and depressed	The day goes by like a snap with emptiness and tiredness but when  <e1> night comes </e1>  I just feel insanely more  <e2> suicidal and depressed </e2> .  I just feel like everything just crashes.  Nights just feel like a nightmare.   
There	else.	There is this girl who I am in love with, and I am trying to get together with her but I can't stop thinking it won't work.  It's complicated, but we have to deal with some things before we could get together.  My OCD keeps making me think that I have messed things up.  Even though deep down I feel we will end up with one and other.  I can only see it in my head not working, even though I know those are my OCD thoughts making me think that.  I don't know what to do when I feel one thing but can't thinking something else.  
me	My whole family is shatterd	I Did something horrible 4 years ago and im worried what effects It Will have.  I feel so ashamed and i can't tell anyone.  If i do.  I Know i Will have  noone.  Because of  <e1> me </e1>   <e2> My whole family is shatterd </e2>  and My Mother blames the person i wronged.  What Did i do? When i was14 i had oral sex with My then 6 year Old sister.  And i have heard that kids that have any form of sex with a adult will have a alot of mental problems.  I regret Every second of It.  I don't know If i can handle Living anymore.  Also i have no sexual attraction to children.  I just don't know why i Did it 
She had gotten me nothing	I wasn't a mother	My oldest child was born on May 28, so on mother's day I was hugely pregnant and my nmom invited us (DH and I)out to lunch.   When the hostess seated us and wished nmom and I both a happy mother's day, nmom informed her that I am not a mother.   We had gotten her a lovely card and a blown glass perfume bottle (her favorite sort of thing at the time).    <e1> She had gotten me nothing </e1>  (because  <e2> I wasn't a mother </e2> ) and whined about how it wasn't as nice as she was expected.   Then, even though she had received a gift and was the one to invite us, we were expected to pay the bill because, after all, she was the one we were there to adore for something she started 24 years earlier and had been shit at ever since.   Yay, nmom! 
I,	feel.	I, personally, feel like there's something wrong with me that I can't seem to figure out.  I love who I am.  But no one else seems to.  Why else would that be, if not because there's something wrong with me? But I'm curious about how different depression is for everyone.  How it makes different people feel.  
I	vent	I just always feel so tired anxious and uncomfortable.  Like a mix between having a really really long day and not wanting to do anything.  Also like driving past a police car but 24/7.  I can't even sleep to feel better.  Falling asleep takes so much effort.  Even with sleeping pills.  And I just feel so uncomfortable.  I can't deal with it.  No matter what I do I feel uncomfortable and stressed.  At the same time I feel nothing.  I have gotten so used to it and I just want everything to be over.  I haven't cried in years, but I really really want to right now.  I'm so sorry for the drunken rant and I feel terrible if anyone has bothered to read this far, but I don't know where else I could vent 
I've been prescribed 0. 45 mg Xanax about 2 months ago	anxiety	I'm sorry for the long post and the incoherence but I'm still not doing ok and I can't be fucked to edit it much.  But here's a tl;dr  tl;dr - What are the earliest symptoms of xanax addictions, when do they start, and is it possible to quit cold turkey if it's early enough.    Hey all,   <e1> I've been prescribed 0. 45 mg Xanax about 2 months ago </e1>  for my  <e2> anxiety </e2> , but have only started taking it daily about a month ago.  Some days I wouldn't take any, and one day a week, when I usually schedule as my self-care day 
energetic	feel euphoric	When I'm  <e1> energetic </e1>  I  <e2> feel euphoric </e2> , like I'm on top of the world.  It's like a high, it's one of the reasons I was never much of a drinker as a teen, I got high on my own energy!   My mind also feels so clear, which is great, I finally feel sharp.  However, my mind races in this state.  Because of this I'm apprehensive about medication.  I want a clear mind, without the racing thoughts.    Should I try a non-stimulant? 
I'm	difficult	I'm 42 years old and have had suicidal ideation since puberty.  Even before that, I was a difficult 
I need to solve this asap	I have more impromptus, speeches, debates, and 30 min presentations to get through	Currently enrolled in a mandatory communications class for business school and have my first presentation tomorrow.  It's an impromptu, where I will get a random topic and have 20 seconds to prepare a mini improv that must be exactly 75 to 90 seconds for a class of 40 A-Types.  :)   My anxiety is through the roof, I can't seem to calm it down.   <e1> I need to solve this asap </e1>  because  <e2> I have more impromptus, speeches, debates, and 30 min presentations to get through </e2> .  I know that if it weren't for my anxiety, I could ace this class.    I am searching for some tips/advice as to how to calm my nerves.   
I'll	sober!	I'll stay sober with you all today.  For some reason I have a overwhelming urge to drink today.  I don't want to let any of you down though.  Here's to staying sober! 
Life	wrong	Life is far from perfect and weekends are the most difficult for me.  Still, I'm fighting.  And I won't stop fighting.  Ever.   I didn't believe I could go a month without drinking.  Yet here I am, steadily approaching five months.  I'd be lying if I told you I'm not still scared most days.  My mind races and gets so far ahead of itself.  As a younger person, I fear that I'm damaged goods to a certain degree.  There's still a lot of goodness and potential left in me, but I can't shake the feeling that some part of me will always be roped off, a sign nearby that reads OUT OF ORDER.   But I didn't believe I could go a month without drinking and here I am.  What other beliefs of mine are false? Goodness how I hope to be wrong 
Hey	frequency?	Hey everyone,   So since December I've been taking benzos very sporadically, I'd say max twice a week and they're only . 5mg fast acting.    But lately I've been experiencing some serious derealization issues when I haven't taken a benzodiazepine for a few days.    Can I be experience withdrawal symptoms from such a low dose and with such low frequency?  
I	this?	I am fortunate enough to have a car.  So I use my car just to lay down in and not do anything.  I don't like being in the house.  So I go to my car and just stay there for hours.  Am I the only one who this?  
Like,	life.	Like, I know what's going on here.  The honeymoon period has worn off and now I'm just. . . facing the rest of my life without the sudden spikes and valleys of alcohol abuse.  It looks. . . flat.   Just to be clear, I'm *not* thinking of drinking again.  My life is a thousand times better now, and I know that this empty feeling isn't going to last forever.  I just have to push through it.  (right?)  Just wondering if anyone knew any way to help this along a little.  Also just sharing your stories of this time with me would be nice I think? I'm like 10% worried this is all I'm ever going to get out of life.  
guilty	not calling	My birthday was also this past week and she did not call me.  Dad sent me an e-gift card with both their names on it- but still, no call from her.  Total NC with her since December.  Should I feel  <e1> guilty </e1>  for  <e2> not calling </e2> ?  
quit	feeling great	I don't smoke with my friends.  I usually just smoke with my husband.  They knew I smoked but I had never really mentioned the quantity.  It's not something I was ever proud of or ok with.  Last night, I told them that I had  <e1> quit </e1>  and I am  <e2> feeling great </e2> .  They were happy for me but now it means I am accountable in a new way.  I don't ever want to have to tell them that I have fallen back into my habit.

two	quit	two days ago i decided to drink i ended up being talked into going to a bar down the street from there i can not remember and was woken up on the hallway floor of my hotel by my boss i cannot make it pass day 6 i do not know if it is a mental but i seem to forget all the pain alcohol causes me i am still hungover from that night and it is almost been 48 hours has anyone else experienced worse and worse relapses before being able to quit

today	loneliness	today a friend of mine was relating her experiences with her first boyfriend, the way she talked about it and about hi am, describing how he was the first man she ever loved, her happy moments, made me so sad, realizing how a woman would never speak that way about me, i am undesirable, no one would want to spend ti ame with me, i hate this life of miserable loneliness
this	anyway	this world we live in must be hell people say life is beautiful but at its very core, it isnt in order to keep yourself alive you have to kill and consume something else every day i am not a vegetarian or vegan i am just expressing my discomfort with the fact that you have to destroy life to stay alive what is the purpose of that if you think about it, every living thing is just food, even us our lives are so fake and detached from nature i do not want to be here the worst part is i have this horrible feeling that when you die you are just reincarnated to another life i know that is not logical but i can not help it i feel like life is one of those dreams you have where you think you ve woken up and go about your routine not realising you are still dreaming then you wake up and it repeats on a loop everything feels backwards to me i can not explain it, this post makes no sense but no one will read it and i do not even care anyway
this	forgetting	this is something like my 5th or 6th reset i first joined a little over a year ago on a different account : i wanted to have a small drink to calm my nerves the night before i took my lsat, wound up draining all the liquor in the house and making an embarassing phone call, woke up the next morning so hungover that it must have made a big difference in my performance number of resets between that and this one, where it turns out that i fucking cheated on my partner last night i kissed her friend i do not even remember doing this for sober me, this is unthinkable i am tired of finding out how shitty i am in new and exciting ways i want to be the type of person i am sober all the ti ame the problem is that i keep forgetting
this	years	this came out longer than expected, so i do not expect anyone to actually read it, but i just feel like putting it out there i have been a shy, scared, and socially awkward person for as long as i can remember growing up, i never had any real friends i have always had random acquaintances at school that i did not feel totally uncomfortable around and could someti ames do projects with, but that is all it is ever been just classmates i have never had a genuine friend who i could talk to or hang out with outside of school hell, i am not even sure what hanging out is supposed to be at this point i have never been in that type of social situation for the last few years
the	stuff	the commonly cited figure is that 50 of ocd sufferers have had suicidal ideation at some point in the past, and 25 have attempted suicide, so i was just wondering if anyone here feels completely un - depressed, and their problems are purely related to anxiety from ocd stuff
soooo,	working!	soooo, read a post on the showerthoughts sub, and just discovered that there are people out there that truly believe the earth is flat what the what thanks adhd, for once again shoving me down the rabbit hole already lost 2 hours of my day i do not believe this myself, but still, fascinating to see why people believe this!! gah - i am supposed to be working!
somehow	reach	somehow managing in what i consider to be an exceptionally well manner for my rather wild and highly destructive nature well lighting up that is yet i feel the apathy escalate as the days go by and i am concerned have not been on meds for about 3 months, and usually when this happens i end up trapped in some kind of episode that will inevitably fuck everything up can not afford that to happen again disappointed with myself that i si amply dislike support groups need to vent somehow, at least do not want to talk to any of my family friends; i dream of someone that will be able to advise me is this too much to ask what is within my reach
so,	us	so, i have been thinking : how much of me is my anxiety as in, if my anxiety magically disappeared, how much would i change when i have certain thoughts, is that my anxiety speaking, or is it me i guess i have just been struggling with the idea of how much my anxiety influences who i am are the fears i have, and the scary thoughts and mistakes i make the result of my anxiety or is my anxiety not to blame, and i am just a scared person who chooses to be sad and anxious am i even me without my anxiety anyway, i guess i was just curious as to what other people thought when it came to our anxiety defining us
so	any	so when i was thinking back on events for about the last year and a half, i realized that almost all the hypo manic episodes i had were associated with increased contact with a specific person i am not really sure if it is an actual cause, or just a weird coincidence, so can being in contact more with a specific person cause mood episodes, or am i just seeing a pattern where there is not any
i am really nervous i have walked out of two jobs on the first day	i was so anxious	so my first day of my new part - ti ame job is tomorrow, and  <e1> i am really nervous i have walked out of two jobs on the first day </e1>  because  <e2> i was so anxious </e2>  i thought i was going to have a panic attack on the spot i intentionally chose to apply at a place that i thought would calm me - it is a store that sells candles, lotions and such - but i am just overwhelmed by this vague terror i do not know how i am going to survive four hours
so	it	so i keep messing up, i had to move this thread from philosophy, i am going to write a long letter describing the problems in society, why they can not be fixed and i really want to stress, i am not mad i am tired, do not see the point, and my family will get over it i know it decapitation by train i have no gun and pills can be bad if you do not do it right this is not a drill stay tuned if i truly get kicked out of the sober house, i am not gonna lose all my shit and have to go salvation army i will post city and state before i do it

it is such a gamble, this could turn my life in either direction	i am scared out of my mind	so i finally did it, i got help and after 3 weeks of counseling the doctor prescribed lexapro, and after reading its effects it is almost like the drug was specifically made for me, but there is a catch, i am scared to death of the side effects, some of them could end up pushing me over the edge hair loss would be devastating, weight changes my body is one of the few things about myself that i am proud of fatigue and insomnia you mean it can get even worse than it already is i have not taken it yet, i will probably discuss it a bit further with my therapist, but  <e1> it is such a gamble, this could turn my life in either direction </e1>  and  <e2> i am scared out of my mind </e2>  , i am not the luckiest of the bunch

just	bit	just quickly give you some info of me if it helps you pinpoint when i should be coughing crap tar black whatever up i quit on 4 19 so technically 4 20 was first day not smoking in 3 years straight everyday i smoked 8 - 12 good bong bowls were talking 3g + a day at least about 2oz a month i think always bong, never jay vape vapes safest healthiest right do not really have many problems getting to sleep, have had like 3 vivid dreams none of which were scary just, ya kno , vivid lol i feel fine now but between days 5 - 6 i felt stressed out and really wanted to smoke and felt angry about everything that was the only ti ame i actually had a craving to smoke otherwise i feel almost no different so my trigger is when i am pissed i would usually smoke weed, now i just call my gf family and talk for a bit
just	:	just close your eyes, empty your lungs, and take a deep breath repeat 4 - 5 ti ames until the urge to smoke passes it has worked for me every ti ame since i quit although i never felt that i was going to lapse during the ti ame, it helps shift my focus and get rid of the urge instantly i am not taking any risks i hope this helps others out! it is helping me :
whats worse is the constantly guilt that i cant fulfill my girlfriend emotionally	this stupid cage my brain is locked	its been almost 3 months since my last smoke edible, i thought id start feeling better, almost nothings changed, i almost miss it, since when i smoked i just pondered if i was a piece of shit, without it i just give in and accept it, and instead of just a lack of emotions, its just ranging somewhat happy to completely miserable, and  <e1> whats worse is the constantly guilt that i cant fulfill my girlfriend emotionally </e1>  because of  <e2> this stupid cage my brain is locked </e2>  in i thought this was the thing that was gonna bounce me back on my feet and in the right direction i just want her to not have to worry and have me be a problem
it	happy	it seems to me that the world really likes people who are happy you are unhappy, for whatever reason, you seem to get shoved aside and ignored a lot more maybe this will become another equality battle in the future those who are unhappy should be loved and respected just as much as those who are happy
it	this	it is unacceptable and disgusting for these people to be not only downvoting personal stories but also contacting victi ams with predatory shit to their inbox no one should have to deal with this garbage on here r adultsurvivors recently took the measure of hiding downvote buttons i do not know what can be done but i doubt i am the only one this has happened to i was sent disgusting messages by user ankle fetish sacks of shit like these need to fucking exposed and banned from this community i do not care if i am coming across as angry or that i am posting this idiot username out here, i am fucking done with people like this
it	one	it is hard to explain, but, lately, they have been hitting very hard and very sudden and no matter how many mindfulness activities i do, it does not stop this intensely uneasy feeling that everything wo not be ok that no treatment is going to work that my therapist hates me that this wo not get better idk whether it is the bpd or the depression talking with this one
she refuses to get help, and refuses to let me get help for her what can i do other than be there for her	i am tired of this all	it is been 3 years now and with each day it gets harder for me  <e1> she refuses to get help, and refuses to let me get help for her what can i do other than be there for her </e1>   <e2> i am tired of this all </e2>  but i love her so much and i really want her to be happy and for us to be happy together and if i leave her, she will have no one i do not know what to do
it	hopelessness	it is a mental block i know but i feel so empty inside i do not have a lot to say here just wanted to see if anyone else has thoughts like this and if it devastates them just as much it is a real sense of hopelessness
it	around	it always feels like i am up in the clouds, looking down on myself do i really care about the burnt toast no when you are really depressed, it seems i ampossible to care about things that other people seem to base their entire lives around
if	are	if your parents tell you and your family that you are hard to talk to, and you begin to believe them, is that gaslighting where they make indirect, snide comments that make you look down on yourself when you literally tell them that you like a specific band from the 1980s or something, and they respond with, oh you do not like that band as if they are trying to convince you that your thoughts are wrong about yourself does that even make sense where they brainwash you into becoming an entire different person than who you really are
i	come	i will not lie today has actually been rough i have been a zombie all day just down and sad all around i kinda expected this though it is my day off and i am by myself right now i have done everything i can think to keep my body busy and my mind even busier for some reason it has not been enough or easy at all the weather is dreadful with high winds, rain coming in waves, and lower 50 to boot i feel literally under the weather the best i can do for the rest of the day is curl up on the couch and binge watch movies maybe i need to take a much needed break from fighting to be healthy again tomorrow i will ride my bike and discover something new hang in there keep sharing keep talking keep going the best is yet to come
i	tonight	i was certain i would come home and drink being surrounded by it does not effect me as much as just being stressed in general we had a rather large event today and it was slightly chaotic on top of that, my mood with my partner and our current standing of our relationship who i work with also, we make a great team and not taking my vitamins stacked up and damn i was ready for a beer or 12 after the event, he confronted me about my mood and i let it out straight and truthfully i took my vitamins , they have been lifesavers against cravings and i rode the wave to the end i didnt pour that beer or open a bottle of wine and damn, i suprised myself and i am proud i will not be drinking with any of you tonight
i am afraid of going cold turkey	withdrawal	i want to stop drinking but not a point in my life when i can enter inpatient treatment and do not know if i can afford outpatient treatment i have not been an all day drinker but drink lots of beer almost every night i am experiencing health problems because of my drinking high blood pressure, high blood sugar  <e1> i am afraid of going cold turkey </e1>  because of  <e2> withdrawal </e2>  do you think i can do this safely at home should i just try tapering off first i appreciate any advice plain tired of drinking
i	do	i tried to kill myself about a week ago, and i still feel suicidal i think i am going to try again today i do not know what i should do
i have been told by multiple people to abandon a friend who has cancer	i apparently do not need that kind of negativity in my life	i think this message was originally ai amed at removing genuinely abusive people from one life, but i think it has evolved into a self - centered refusal to listen to anybody problems but your own i could use myself as a case in point, but i have something better -  <e1> i have been told by multiple people to abandon a friend who has cancer </e1>  because  <e2> i apparently do not need that kind of negativity in my life </e2>  what kind of fucked up shit is that not even the terminally ill are deserving of our sympathy if they interrupt our happiness parades no wonder it is acceptable to drop depressed people from your life at will if you do not entertain me and uncritically boost my ego
damn well proud of it	i had no craving as we speak	i spent some quality ti ames with friends yesterday whom all were indulging in pot though the whole day and night i had no inclination for pot at all and  <e1> damn well proud of it </e1>  definitely still feeling withdrawals, but i am stoked that  <e2> i had no craving as we speak </e2>  i have a half gram of wax just a step over to my desk no craving this is great i am also starting to feel more clear headed
nothing elsei am a loneri have horrible social skills and nothing is going right for mewhat is the point of even living just to be a bottom feeder who can not even open his mouth to have some friends just to live a life of uselessnessevery	i lie there in bed and i just can not fall asleep the tears wo not come	i seriously can not think of another reason not to just end this worthless life of mine i am a senior in high school, but i am an outcasti have zero real friends at all, no one i can call up to hang out after school or go to the movies on weekends no girl has ever even had a remote interest in me i have obviously never had a gf i have acquaintances at school that i say hi to once in a while but  <e1> nothing elsei am a loneri have horrible social skills and nothing is going right for mewhat is the point of even living just to be a bottom feeder who can not even open his mouth to have some friends just to live a life of uselessnessevery </e1>  night  <e2> i lie there in bed and i just can not fall asleep the tears wo not come </e2>  , but the forever pain just lies rooted in, unwilling to come outmy escape comes from thinking about how i want to kill my self jump of a bridge or perhaps a cliff i am worthless and there is no place for me in this world
i	reason	i recently got 90 days sober and drank the day after since then i have drank pretty much every evening i am afraid i wo not be able to stop until something bad happens and gives me a good reason
i	occasion	i plan on putting the weed down 8 days clean and counting but i figure in 3 months ti ame i will be completely clean and could possibly indulge once a month or every so often just like having ice cream every now and then versus an everyday thing i guess what i am trying to say is, moderation why do people on this sub act like one has to put it down, forever one can not indulge every now and then just like one does with various other things i dont see the harm but at the same ti ame i do not want to be reliant on pot i have been smoking everyday since i was 16 i am 23 now i have quit for a year before so i do not think will power is an issue i just dont want to put weed down forever i want to smoke it on occasion
i feel so lonely	she promises to come back, but ends up falling asleep and does not she said she would come back today	i mean, i am happy for her i like the guy and he really nice but i miss spending ti ame with my friend we used to have sleepovers every weekend now  <e1> i feel so lonely </e1>  in bed at night  <e2> she promises to come back, but ends up falling asleep and does not she said she would come back today </e2>  
falled back into this nasty habit after a break - up today on april 21st	i never want to smoke again i hope i will succeed	i like how apps keep counting my saved money, show health benefits, etc really helps with motivation i was smoking - free from august 2011 - june 2016 but  <e1> falled back into this nasty habit after a break - up today on april 21st </e1>  i flushed down the toilet the remaining cigs, and  <e2> i never want to smoke again i hope i will succeed </e2>  
i	mirror	i keep having these bad thoughts and they wo not go away i do not want to act on them but it is getting harder i do not want to hurt anybody i keep sabotaging myself what am i supposed to do is suicide the only way deep down i do not believe that i am just such a terrible person i can not stand looking at myself in the mirror
i	die	i just want to die i have attempted 3 ti ames before but everything in my life is so shit i just can not do this any more, i am a worthless, replaceable piece of shit that is desperate for any amount of affection i just want to die
which is crazy	i slept horribly while drinking	i just hit day 10 i have read plenty of posts here about how sluggishness and headaches can accompany the transition process, so i suppose i expected the general blah feeling i have been experiencing i am not sleeping as well though -  <e1> which is crazy </e1>  because  <e2> i slept horribly while drinking </e2>  ! i guess i was hoping to feel better by now most i amportantly, i have been utterly lost for almost a week, the last few being the worst i feel depressed and bored i am embarrassed at who i was but somehow feel more worthless now i have not been able to maintain that positive outlook i had on day one, and i am more bitter and angry than i remember being in a long ti ame is that a thing i am sure this just part of process, but it sucks as if quitting is not hard enough
i	sorrow	i just feel like there is no reason to keep on living in this world alone, and empty i was happy for a small amount of ti ame but of course all good things do come to an end for me at least i feel as if there is no value in my life and continuing on much longer i try and try and try to wake up day by day by day with a positive attitude stating today is going to be a good day i am just ready to give it all up by now like idk i just see no more hope like even if it does get better once more whose to say it just wo not get worse again i assume these last few days are a sign to finally give up and just end this cycle of sorrow
people need help and there is support for them here	it is always great when people post supportive messages so, everything will be okay panicking is not gonna solve a problem	i i amagine that most of the people on this subreddit at any given ti ame are feeling anxiety i think it would be great if they could open up this subreddit and just see this message a lot of the posts here are about people troubles which is ok,  <e1> people need help and there is support for them here </e1>  , so  <e2> it is always great when people post supportive messages so, everything will be okay panicking is not gonna solve a problem </e2>  , just take a second, a minute, an hour, maybe even a day to just take a ti ame out and calm down i wish you all the best, it inspires me to see how much you guys are able to go through and still survive
i	anymore	i have tried literally everything to try and solve this i have been a fucking misfit , outcast and isolated idiot for most of my life and there is really no point anymore
i think i make a lot of unnecessary facial expressions	let the other people which i am talking with, that i am present and i am paying attention	i have social anxiety for the last 5 years on a scale from 1 min to 10 max , i would say it fluctuates between 4 and 8 two things bug me the most : 1 i can not open my mouth properly and get the words out when talking to someone i feel uncomfortable with 2  <e1> i think i make a lot of unnecessary facial expressions </e1>  , like expressing my emotions and exaggerating all the ti ame i think i mostly do this to  <e2> let the other people which i am talking with, that i am present and i am paying attention </e2>  while i feel it is too much and makes me feel uncomfortable, it is really hard to monitor it and quit it any suggestions
i	then	i have problems trying to fall asleep for example i come back from work at night, and then i lie down in my bed when i feel sleepy and i start thinking about my life and i get angry,and sad and i end up lying in my bed for hours litterally being sad i slept just 3 hours last day,i aam feeling really tired but i can not close my eyes and sleep instead i am drinking beer and waiting for the night to come maybe i will sleep then
i	this	i have noticed i have much better memory recall when i am hypomanic, never really been in the state of mind to see if this holds true while full blown manic but i i amagine it would be something si amilar if i had enough wherewithall to try and recall something anyone else notice this or am i just special and or deluded like i genuinely remember shit about my childhood like is common in psychedelic trips that i can guaran - fucking - te you i would not be able to if i were baseline as far as my mood is concerned edit : please feel free to say you ve never experienced anything like this
i	point	i have hated life for as long as i can remember then when i was 12, it got worse continued getting worse until i was 16 then pretty much went for about 4 months, but then came a lot worse then ever before i just fucking hate life nothing is interesting, anything that makes me happy is only temporary my friends do not even care about me i told them i am suicidal, and then they said i just wanted attention, and said if i am going to do it i would of done it i just feel like doing it just to prove a point
i	readjusting	i have had a reasonable amount of success in cutting back on marijuana but something almost always brings me back to it there is a school of thought that says that it is days clean that matters, which i amplies that cutting back is not effective and you have to go cold turkey my experience contradicts that, i have managed to cut back significantly over the last year and even if i relapse it is easier to cut back again i think marijuana has made me more i ampulsive and focused on the short term i used it mainly because i did not have much in life to make me feel good of course, it took away my motivation and focus and made it hard for me to accomplish anything i managed to get some stuff done during my quitting periods but i would still get tempted and start again but mainly followed my rules like only on weekends i had lots of setbacks but overall i have moved forwardnow i am feeling better than i have in a long ti ame, focusing more on the long term and looking forward to my brain readjusting
i am just disappointed in myself	i am mad that i did not do that much better than last ti ame	i have been working out for a few weeks and i feel no different before, during or after i like the idea of it cardio and lifting , but the whole ti ame i am doing it my brain is just telling me to stop every rep i feel weak, every pedal i feel slow, and when i get back to my apartment  <e1> i am just disappointed in myself </e1>   <e2> i am mad that i did not do that much better than last ti ame </e2>  , or just too tired to do anything else that afternoon, or i go full meta and get sad for still being sad tldr; fuck me
i	ready	i have been thinking about it , a lot it will be my third attempt but this ti ame i want it for good the 2 first try did not work and i have never recovered from it, nor will i ever i got myself a suite in an hotel, lot of alchohol, smokes i want to die happy and it is a word i would like for once to use properly : happy i do not want to talk about, or finish my night talking to people from my life i am leaving in an hour from home, i am ready
i try looking for support and help but i have a hard ti ame	i get confused a lot with websites and stuff	i have been off my meds for close to two years now it takes work but i think i have done pretty well but it seems like every ti ame i learn to deal with something another problem comes along i learned to calm down when all my senses were firing up but now they do not even make sense i can smell emotion mixed with a stale air feel i can feel things in the air through my teeth there is lights that wrap around everything and i can see things move in what i view as ti ame i have gotten better at ignoring all of it but then when i get stressed it gets harder to fight and lately i feel like i am losing control of my stress slowly but continuously i wish i had someone to talk to about it but it seems like the only advice people give is take your meds  <e1> i try looking for support and help but i have a hard ti ame </e1>  because  <e2> i get confused a lot with websites and stuff </e2>  
i	experiences	i have been having trouble falling asleep since i quit smoking i am not sure it is withdrawals, it might be my default state as i grow older, just now noticing without weed to knock me out both my parents have trouble sleeping but i sure never used to seems now i am on a boom and bust cycle, where i will sleep really poorly one night, then the next night be super tired and sleep amazingly for 10 hours i will say the sleep i do get is much more restful than when i was smoking my dreams are amazing i am also much more alert during the day overall i feel better i have no moderation when it comes to cannabis and smoked all day every day i could not just smoke in the evenings or something i mean i could if i wanted to try super fucking hard but it is just easier to not smoke i forget exactly when i quit but i am probably two, two and a half weeks out anyone else with si amilar experiences
i	again	i hate the shakes, i hate the flashes of i amages, i hate how certain smells and sounds just fucking set me off and i fucking hate feeling weak i just want it all to stop, and i know my meds are on their way, but i just want to make it stop my body does not feel like it is my body, i am always on alert now, and even my husband does not know what to do i just want to be in control of myself again
my dad was happy to yell bloody murder at us all day	not taking care of the chores	i had to learn to do everything for myself, by myself when i was a kid when my dad tried to teach us he always did it in a condescending and chiding manner and no one was liable to listen most ti ames he did not care or was too busy dicking off about things x y and z that he was pissed off about that day he would sooner pull out his belt and start lumbering down the hall like an ogre than sit down and talk to us like a man i got made fun of at school and at home by my babysitter for not knowing how to do basic things like dishes or tying my own shoes  <e1> my dad was happy to yell bloody murder at us all day </e1>  for  <e2> not taking care of the chores </e2>  but never lifted a finger but to insult us to our faces as a result
literally i am just some sex object, i dont have stability	he always makes me travel with hi am anyways	i got a shithead abusive stepdad i dont really know what i am going to talk about and what i wont in here but things are just bad at home not sure what i am ready to share, but hes awful beats me up, uses me as a way to get money,  <e1> literally i am just some sex object, i dont have stability </e1>  because  <e2> he always makes me travel with hi am anyways </e2>  , would appreciate a friend i can talk to about all this, i dont usually open up about any of this was told to post on here so
i	myself	i finally found someone i am genuinely happy with situation sucks but that is not the issue for the first ti ame i am with someone who is good for me but i keep pushing i feel undeserving and do not want to hurt anyone again i do not know how to stop sabotaging and i am tired of all the fighting going on in my head i do not know how to not be so difficult and negative and i feel like i need to help hi am learn how to handle me any suggestions i do not understand myself at all so i can not help hi am myself
i	this	i feel really bad anxiety over things that i know are not affecting me right now so much that i feel numb when i am doing anything else like i just go about my day but then read articles and i feel paralyzed with fear and worry that things are not going to be okay like what is the point of even finding a job if a machine is just going to replace me what is the world going to be like if no one is working and machines just do everything why are not we doing more for cli amate change i guess i am not having kids then and then all this stuff happening with north korea is anyone else going through this
i	calls	i feel like eventually my workplaces always cause severe anxiety it is hard to tell if it is them or in my head i probably care too much about certain aspects, but then i have to ask if i should be working in a place that causes so much anxiety anyone have the same struggle do you seek out help i practice yoga 3 ti ames a week, workout twice a week and get outdoors and hang with ani amals once a week lots of water and no caffeine i feel like i am doing everything right but there is still the terror while sitting in the parking lot and heart racing when my boss calls
i found myself terrified of crying in a church full of people, it happened in the end	i just could not hold it anymore	i do not trust this woman enough to tell her how i really feel, i know if i truly open up then i will end up crying and i cannot stand crying in front of other people, i will do anything to stop myself tearing up if i am not on my own even at my dads funeral  <e1> i found myself terrified of crying in a church full of people, it happened in the end </e1>  because  <e2> i just could not hold it anymore </e2>  , but i did not want to i also do not trust her not to tell others what if i say something negative about my family and it gets back to them in someway i know she is sworn to secrecy but i can not get that into my head for some reason
it i feel a bit indignant that people assume	my life situation is lame and uni amproving that i do not know good ways to i amprove it	i come off as an ass by accident someti ames when someone presents advice to me on how i could i amprove my life and i explain to them that i already very well know how to i amprove my life and already understand their advice but wo not realistically follow  <e1> it i feel a bit indignant that people assume </e1>  just because  <e2> my life situation is lame and uni amproving that i do not know good ways to i amprove it </e2>  sigh anyone else feel like this should i just hide my indignance and be like oh yes thank you for the great advice; i will give it a try! i mean who am i really helping by being indignant
i am worried	recently it is getting harder to keep reality at bay	i can not survive without something to make my life go away for a while  <e1> i am worried </e1>  because  <e2> recently it is getting harder to keep reality at bay </e2>  
i	scared	i can not find any of the answers i am looking for i lack almost all motivation to take care of any of my responsibilities i have almost no passions the only thing i look forward to is losing my sobriety my self - esteem is at a rock - bottom i do not believe i am really worth much of anything, and if i am, then i am incredibly replaceable i am afraid i will never beat this i am sad, lonely, and scared
i	desire	i am trying my best at being patient and understanding i know that my so is under a lot of pressure to finish this semester with all a our sex life has taken a pretty big hit as a result though where we used to be inti amate several ti ames a week, i am lucky now if it is once a week or once every two weeks i have tried talking to hi am about it, but he just seems embarrassed he knows he been distracted, and says it is just stress related it is hard not to take it personal though and i keep trying to remind myself that there is only 9 more days to the semester anyone have tips from going through the same thing i know that hypersexuality can be a symptom, but i have not heard much about lack of drive or desire
i	so	i am still going hope to make it another week it gets easier i do not think about smoking very often but i do think about it no physical pain any more i think i am still a bit down emotionally mentally stick to it if you want to quit in my experience a day or two after you get the nicotine out of you system you start feeling better so day 5 or so
i flinally realize i have to change	i am wasting my life away by drinking so much	i am so glad i found this group i am almost done with my third day of no alcohol - i have not had this many days sober in probably 5 years it feels amazing and scary, but  <e1> i flinally realize i have to change </e1>  because  <e2> i am wasting my life away by drinking so much </e2>  i thought it was serving me all these years, but it is finally glaringly obvious that it was not thank you all for sharing your stories and for giving support, i hope to do the same
i	too	i am on meds for an anxiety disorder the constant anxiety caused me to feel isolated and useless that caused depression i am now on meds for depression i have never been suicidal before this, but now my thoughts about dying are constant today i cleaned up my house and organized things, sort of like nesting, preparing for something i feel like everything is coming apart and i just need to die i do not want to leave my kids i can not seem to stop these thoughts i think i should stop the depression meds they seem to have made things worse do i just stop taking them the doctor told me a month ago that i need to work up to a certain dosage, so i am guessing that means i need to wean off them but i do not want to kill myself in the meanti ame i heard that withdrawals can cause suicidal thoughts, too
i am empty i can not speak	my lips are shut by this weight i cannot explain	i am not sure what i want to say, or how i feel i am not entirely sure that i feel anything i want to be positive, i want to be happy, i want to have hope, but nothing materializes i have people in my life, but  <e1> i am empty i can not speak </e1>  because  <e2> my lips are shut by this weight i cannot explain </e2>  , while i watch myself crumble away from the inside out
i	day	i am not diagnosed but i am quite certain i am not asking for a diagnosis here, i am just wondering how i bring this up i am currently being seen for moderate to severe depression and moderate anxiety but i do not think those things quantify the whole story and i suppose it depends on the day

i	it	i am just curious if anyone here has quit clonazepam, and if so, is it easier to quit clonazepam then kratom i am just wondering because kratom was a super big bitch for me as far as post acute withdrawal, and coming up soon i am going to begin my taper off of 2 mg per day of clonazepam i know everyone is different, but i am just curious as to others experience around it

So	me.	So I've begun to notice that when I'm dissociating I smile a lot and can't talk.  Or so people tell me.  When I'm alone and dissociating though (or even when I'm not alone) I find my facial expressions change randomly on their own.  My mouth and chin twitchs.  I go from having a scrunched up, scared face to having a completely relaxed one.  Or a sad one.  Or angry occasionaly.  And they cycle.  Usually spend more in the blank state though.  It's very weird and I didn't really think much of it until recently.  I guess I'm becoming more aware? Idk.  Anyone else have this? Also.  The flashbacks part (I think?)Sometimes when I have flashbacks I talk to myself.  But not really.  It's like there are multiple people.  But it's not completely me.  For example, I had one a few hours ago.  I don't remember much about the context and idk the trigger either.  But there was one part of me almost that didn't feel like me.  It was crying and talking to me.  Then it'd switch to me. 
tend to be very emotional and have severe guilt	not being there for my friends, my family, the people that love me	It's like my emotions come rushing back and I'm being reborn again becoming the person I used to be.  I  <e1> tend to be very emotional and have severe guilt </e1>   for  <e2> not being there for my friends, my family, the people that love me </e2>  .  I'm tired of forgetting who I am and letting a drug drain me of my emotions, stealing who I really am from me. . . If only this feeling didn't fade I would never let it happen ever again.  I'm paying for all the lost time and all of the times I let myself and my family down and not even giving it a second thought.  Fuck this shit never again.  I'm sorry for ranting.  This subreddit was the main reason for me acknowledging what this plant (drug) was doing to me, no more numbing myself down.  And I thank you all for that we all need to get our true selves back.  And I know it's hard but it's so so so worth it.  FUCK kratom and any other drug that could ever deprive me of who I really am. Thank you again to everyone here and good luck and be strong. 
No	you.	No more will I be crushed by this stupid extrovert-ruling, money-worshipping society.  You can all go to hell.  No longer will I be the good friend for girls who ignore me to hook up with other guys.  I'll never be good enough for any of you. 
I have run out of things to think about	I'm now trapped in the moment	This always seems to happen when I'm a little sad and self-analysing.  It's the middle of the night and  <e1> I have run out of things to think about </e1>   so  <e2> I'm now trapped in the moment </e2>  .  Sleep is all but an elusive daydream which gets only further from fruition the more I think about it.  I'm tired and comfy, I even had a little joint earlier that's ramped up the tiredness.  But no, hours of listening to the cars outside my window instead of sleep.  Does anyone else get this? Can't just be me, right?
Nobody in my family is on my side	they're all too afraid of her to pick sides	Recently went NC with Mom after 20 years.   <e1> Nobody in my family is on my side </e1>   --  <e2> they're all too afraid of her to pick sides </e2>  .  Even my grandmother
I heard someone coming down the stairs	I quickly put them back	I had the bottle of pills in my hand.  I opened them, poured them into my palm and stared at them for a while.   <e1> I heard someone coming down the stairs </e1>   so  <e2> I quickly put them back </e2>  . I won't have access to them again for a month or two.  I missed my chance and I'm so angry with myself. I'm a coward.  
I'm	injury	I'm extremely anxious they're just going to invalidate or dismiss my concerns and get me to do a blood test or some shit instead. . . .  I really want a referral to a psychiatrist who's specialised in this, but need to go through a GP first to claim rebate.  And yeah I don't know, I'm just anxious, and I hate how stigmatised mental abnormalities are like it's harder to talk about them openly as opposed to talking about a cold or a physical injury
the antidepressant taking off that adrenaline edge	both my noradrenaline and serotonine reuptake being inhibited	4th week on it already feel normal.  Also taking antidepressant, I suspect they are a good combination,  <e1> the antidepressant taking off that adrenaline edge </e1>  .   So basically  <e2> both my noradrenaline and serotonine reuptake being inhibited </e2>  . Ritalin and stuff are not allowed here for adults (Austria).  But Strattera is good enough. I just feel confident, professional, remembering stuff, productive, that kind of thing. No pissing problems, but my shitting seems sometimes weird. It does increase blood pressure but mine was low anyway, like 105, on Strattera 115.  The 100+ pulse it gives is sometimes annoying. Still just on 60mg a day and I will get 80mg once I am used to it. Also helps with impulsivity 80% of the times. Seems my creativity is lower.  Look at how I write, right now.  Pretty shitty eh?
Even	on.	Even if I've watched 100 hours of a certain show, I still have problems remembering the characters' names.  It's really frustrating, especially when watching character heavy films like lord of the rings or game of thrones.  Sometimes I just keep imdb open with all the character names so I have an idea of what's going on. 
When	doubts.	When I begin to question whether things were really that bad.  I struggle with remembering any memories to the contrary.  Having some sort of record is really important.   I'm excited that I have someone to help validate my past when I have my doubts. 
I'm	empty	I'm ready to be honest about my inner self! But now there is no one to tell.  Is it possible to build a life from scratch? No matter how much better I get, my life is still so empty 
I attended my first meeting	I came out feeling mega encouraged	I didn't quite know what to expect, but a buddy of mine told me about AA a couple years ago when I was trying to quit K the first time, but I never went. Tonight  <e1> I attended my first meeting </e1>  , and I must say, even through the sleeplessness, anxiety, depression, fatigue,  <e2> I came out feeling mega encouraged </e2>  , met some great people that I can relate to 100%, I shared my story honestly with them, and I will be back 2 nights from now. If you've never considered this, I encourage you to take a leap of faith and find one near you.   I must say, I'm winding down night # 6 and I am feeling supremely hopeful.   I know that tomorrow morning will be awful, most likely, but I met people there that made it out alive from worse things than I've ever done. Try it. 
I have been on vyvanse for a few weeks	40mg I feel a little more of a pumping heart and have a little of the typical appetite loss and less tiredness at night	So, everyone I know who has ever taken adderall recreationally has described it as a euphoric, religious experience where they have gotten every essay ever written and cleaned their whole house.   <e1> I have been on vyvanse for a few weeks </e1>  .  20mg to start (we were concerned about side effects) and I felt perhaps a little clearer but mostly nothing.   <e2> 40mg I feel a little more of a pumping heart and have a little of the typical appetite loss and less tiredness at night </e2>  .  But as far as attention goes. . .  the drug thing is new to me.  I don't feel more focused on the drug I don't think.  I feel happy and good and fine, but. . .  will there be a magic moment? How do I know when it works?
I have been living with a lot of stress	I've become completely phobic.  But also I feel spacey, regretful, horribly fearful of death	Sometimes my heart rate falls below 60.  Sometimes it's 54bpm.  Earlier it was 58bpm and O2 was 95 when I sat.  While standing it was 76 or so.   When I changed my breathing the day went up.  I've seen it as low as 54, no energy, cold limbs.  Called the paramedics.  Everyone says I'm ok.  Could it be stress? I'm afraid to go to sleep because I fear my heart will stop or I'll have a stroke.  I don't think I'm short of breath.  I know stress rarely caused low heart rate.   <e1> I have been living with a lot of stress </e1>   though.  But  <e2> I've become completely phobic.  But also I feel spacey, regretful, horribly fearful of death </e2>  .  I have panic attacks depression and am a hypochondriac.  My Dr, a cardiologist, told me I'm ok after a blood test and exam but I still want an ecg.  
I'm sitting at home feeling bored and anxious	I go for a small drive	How did you do it? I'm stable enough, but I lack self control.   <e1> I'm sitting at home feeling bored and anxious </e1>   so  <e2> I go for a small drive </e2>  .  Which always turns into a large drive.  I'm spending $ 50 a day on gas
I'm menopausing	I've been getting restless legs and hot and cold flashes	How did you deal with restless legs and hot and cold flashes? These are my primary symptoms.  I'm going to the doctor to ask for treatment for restless legs.  Did you use clonodine, lyrica, gabapenten, or something else?   <e1> I'm menopausing </e1>   so i'm going to say that since it happened  <e2> I've been getting restless legs and hot and cold flashes </e2>   and see what they give me. 
had a certain level of anxiety and stress	you are almost always short of breath and constantly looking around, almost like paranoia, but just out of constant worry of anything	Anyone else ever  <e1> had a certain level of anxiety and stress </e1>   were  <e2> you are almost always short of breath and constantly looking around, almost like paranoia, but just out of constant worry of anything </e2>  .  Do you ever feel like the whole world is always out to get you, or that any little thing you do will always have massive ramifications? The anxiety is not so bad that you stay home every day (skipping school/work) yet everyday you are confronted with challenging situations and you feel terrible in them, only to come out and realise that everything you said and did in the situation was the anxiety and not you.  The common method of 'facing fears anxiety don't actually correct it.  I could go through a highly stressful and anxious moment over and over a hundred times and still shut down. . . 
I've	here?	I've been hazy headed lately and had weird anxious thoughts and I'm always worried I'm developing a mental disorder.  Anyone else get here?
Even	today.	Even though its not the main reason for my sobriety I have to admit that losing weight is a strong motivator to keep going.  Its only been a week and in that time I would have drunk 4900 calories.  I stepped onto the scale this morning thinking I would have at least stayed steady but I've jumped 5kg (11lb) I understand that it could be bunch of things causing this but with better food choices thanks to no drunk binging Im just a little disheartened is all.  Thanks for listening.  I will not drink with you today. 
My annoyance level is through the roof	I've broken it off with my bf roughly 17 times this weekend	 <e1> My annoyance level is through the roof </e1>  .   <e2> I've broken it off with my bf roughly 17 times this weekend </e2>  .  When does it smooth out? I can't take it.  It's the smallest things but it's only from the people that I actually care about.   I told him today I need space for fear I'll end it completely.  He's a good guy, still haven't figured out why he's sticking around.  Anyway. . .  how long did it take for you to kind of get grounded with wellbutrin, topomax and seroquel? Edit: I've broken it off 17 times with my bf in my head. 
I	on	I wrote this as a comment in a thread about realising that we victimised ourselves and act out too (which is an amazing realisation on its own, see  reddit. com/r/CPTSD/comments/6e8s2k/comment/di99qs2) but I wanted to give it more visibility in case it helps someone: One of the most humbling experiences I've had while travelling is meeting people who act out and seeing that reflection in myself.  I've felt victimised a lot while travelling, but if you slow down the process, you can really see where it starts and how a stranger goes from totally ok in your mind, to the enemy for making you feel powerless, in one fell swoop.  It's in these moments of realisation that you need to find more and more space and really deliberate on how to act.  For me it's meant just saying hold on
I caved in	It sucks I relapsed	So  <e1> I caved in </e1>   about an hour ago.   <e2> It sucks I relapsed </e2>   but I'm proud of myself for making it this far.  37 days is much longer than I was expecting to last.  I have made progress and I encourage everyone else here to keep pressing on.  Hopefully I can make it even further next time :) 
I'm	fear?	I'm glad I finally found this sub, my life has been truly frightening for a long time now, and nobody around me seems to get it.  I am a pre-nursing student, and working as a CNA(and almost a CMA), my coworkers get frustrated with me throughout the day, and my boss praises me for my attention to detail.  How to I accurately explain to all of them how I suffer? How do I explain I'm trying to manage this all ? How do I explain to my boss, I do all my checks and actions not out of detail, but out of fear?

I NEEDED her and she walked away to someone else	I don't want to live any more	I've had enough of this life. . .  I'm miserable 24/7.   <e1> I NEEDED her and she walked away to someone else </e1>  .   <e2> I don't want to live any more </e2>  .  Things are supposed to get better but it's been months and I still just want to die.  I can't do this any more.  I'm ending it all tonight.  Fuck this cruel planet. 
I	you!	I was diagnosed with ADD ~12 years ago and have been on Adderall ever since.  I'm currently 24 and going to graduate in December.  I'm planning on teaching in Japan once I'm done with school and I know that Adderall is illegal there.  I'm considering switching to Concerta, which is legal, but I don't speak Japanese and I'm sure I won't become proficient enough in a year to go to a Doctor to get a prescription.  Does anyone have any advice for going off of medication after that long? I would ween myself off it, but I'm concerned about managing in a completely new culture completely unmedicated.  Thank you!
people not giving a fuck about how they treat you	you are a stranger	I am just reaching out, been struggling with depressive episodes over the last few weeks.  It is so fucking frustrating being alive, being an adult, the daily schedule management, the attempts to date, and  <e1> people not giving a fuck about how they treat you </e1>   because  <e2> you are a stranger </e2>  .  It so hard to explain to people what suicidal thoughts feel like.  They ask, Why do you want to die?
My	sadness	My heart goes out to Reaper_of_Souls in this difficult time.  He and I have been in touch as we mourn together.  His mother was a complicated person.  Today I'm going through complicated emotions I can't entirely identify.  Those are just the ones I can feel right now.  Every half hour or so I find myself crying in this entirely new world.  It feels surreal.  During his time fighting cancer I learned victory at sea is when you lose to the sea.  I had some beer by that name sitting in the fridge at the time and decided I'd drink it when he lost the battle.  I've been worried about drinking to numb the sadness
I'm	help.	I'm 28 about to be 29 in a few weeks and have been smoking since I was 15.  I'm smoking close to 2 packs a day and just received patches.  I have a few questions, some may be dumb.  Should I start tomorrow on June 1st which is right before the weekend when me and m'lady drink or wait until the beginning of the week?  I'm anxious about patches, is it just nerves and I'm crazy or should I be worried?(21mg patches) The literature that was given kept referring to the 5 Ds.  I don't have any talents/hobbies other than playing video games.  What should I do to pass the urges, stress and boredom.  I really wanna quit, help. 
she still has a part ten songs from now	I'm starving.  I'm irritated with my phone's keyboard	My ex did not share any details with me.  My paranoia is saying this is a set up.  These will be random thoughts.  Rehearsal for her first dance recital.  She's five.  This started. . .  3 hours ago.  And  <e1> she still has a part ten songs from now </e1>   as a helpful other parent from her class informed me.   <e2> I'm starving.  I'm irritated with my phone's keyboard </e2>  .  I'm super fucking irritated with being irritated about my sociopathic POS ex rather than enjoying this sneak preview. 
cockroaches are starting to pop up everywhere, there's ants, there's short fused people who can't stop getting mad and yelling at everything and everyone	I hate my life	I can't help but laugh out of nowhere when I'm around the people who have put me in this shitty position.  No wonder they treat me like I'm still mentally a child.  I cannot fucking stop laughing.  This house looks like something you see on hoarders,  <e1> cockroaches are starting to pop up everywhere, there's ants, there's short fused people who can't stop getting mad and yelling at everything and everyone </e1>  , I don't feel like I'm in control of my fucking life, and I can't get out.   <e2> I hate my life </e2>  .  There's nothing I can do to get the fuck out of this house.  I don't have a job, I can't get a job.  Any of my attempts to make money on my own have failed.  I can't drive, I'm scared of everything, and this family will never change.  Every single year since I was in middle school, my sister has planned on getting back to college.  She's almost 30.  She's not here currently
I	others.	I posted on cptsd the other day about the cycle of abuse and another poster mentioned the [Drama Triangle]( lynneforrest. com/articles/2008/06/the-faces-of-victim/).  It's a fairly long read, but I do feel that it applies to me and there are some cases where I have ended up finding myself drawn to other victims of narcissism, just to end up being abused by them later on down the line. I worry about how I could possibly be the case and may not even be aware of it.  It's already bad enough that I have severe social anxiety and it sucks knowing that being a victim may possibly be a deterrent for others. 
I'm really struggling to stand up for myself	I know what they're done is completely wrong	I recently went NC with my parents and I have never been so happy.  Unfortunately, due to awkward circumstances I have to go view houses with my mum today, and I know she will make me go home.  My birthday is on Sunday and they really want me to go to dinner with them, they say they're going to buy me loads of presents and all that stupid crap but I actually want to spend it with my boyfriend and his family who have been my rock since I went NC.  I guess my old victim mentality is coming back at me again and is telling me what I'm doing is wrong.  I know it stems from years of always being the the reason things go wrong, but  <e1> I'm really struggling to stand up for myself </e1>  , because  <e2> I know what they're done is completely wrong </e2>   and I can't handle being around them anymore.  Any advice would be great, has anyone ever been in a similar situation where the guilt (you know isn't your fault) kicks in? 
she was at least somewhat emotionally/verbally abusive	Some of the things she's done to me: Called the police on me for not wanting to do homework Constantly compared me to my cousins, called me a worthless daughter, called me a slut once who will probably get pregnant soon (I was 12) Told strangers/relatives personal details about all my chronic health issues.  Chased my sister and I with a knife Gossiped about me to other people in front of my face in a language I didn't quite understand, then called me sensitive when I told her to stop it	As a teen I had a very rocky relationship with my mother.  We were always butting heads and I would definitely say  <e1> she was at least somewhat emotionally/verbally abusive </e1>  .  I am now in my early 20s and living at home.  Our relationship is less volatile, but I think I am still resentful of how she treated me as a kid.   <e2> Some of the things she's done to me: Called the police on me for not wanting to do homework Constantly compared me to my cousins, called me a worthless daughter, called me a slut once who will probably get pregnant soon (I was 12) Told strangers/relatives personal details about all my chronic health issues.  Chased my sister and I with a knife Gossiped about me to other people in front of my face in a language I didn't quite understand, then called me sensitive when I told her to stop it </e2>  .  But she's also a decent mother in some ways.  She cooks
ADHD	unintentionally selfish	I find my  <e1> ADHD </e1>   can make me so very  <e2> unintentionally selfish </e2>  .  It's comorbid with depression and anxiety, and so I find that I get so fixated on trying to fix being sad
Hoping	myself	Hoping to pass a drug test by day 30-35.  Yall, i never would have guessed i would have madd it this far.  And im honestly so proud of myself  
I	advice.	I remember during my secondary diagnosis that the psychiatrist flat out told me that success in life would be a pipe dream if I did not get treated.  It wasn't until the last couple of years that I started to understand my disorder.  After watching that series of videos posted yesterday talking about ADHD from Dr.  Russell Barkley, it made me realize that I need to prioritize getting my ADHD treated.  It's time to start living a productive life.  Does anyone have advice going forward? I don't have a lot of money to shell out for therapy, but the way I see it, I've got to get myself taken care of.  What are some great questions to ask a physician or psychiatrist to figure out which medication options are best for me.  Hell, if anyone can recommend one in the North West GA area that knows ADHD, I would appreciate it.  Also can anyone recommend any options for getting financial assistance for meds? I make too much to qualify for Medicare or any other medical government assistance, at least not for another 20 something years.  Thanks to any one that can offer advice.  
I don't feel like I've been helped or he's been helping	My first instinct is to seek out a new therapist	I've been seeing my therapist, on and off and as-needed, for a few years now.  We get along well, he's very nice and has been very helpful.  But I feel like it's time for a change.  The last few times I've gone to him,  <e1> I don't feel like I've been helped or he's been helping </e1>  .   <e2> My first instinct is to seek out a new therapist </e2>  .  But I'm not sure if he's the problem or if I am.  Like, he's giving fine advice and counsel but I'm not taking it or keep going down the same rabbit holes.  So I'm trying to figure out of it's my therapist that needs to change, or me? Those of you who have changed therapists (because they weren't working well for you), how and why did you change?
people will no longer like me	I've changed	Does anybody here suffer from codependency issues? I'm a longtime anxiety sufferer, and I just learned about codependency recently and I definitely think I suffer from it as well.  I started this book called The New Codependency.  There's a section about setting boundaries which I've realized I'm terrible at, but now I'm scared that if I start setting boundaries that  <e1> people will no longer like me </e1>   because  <e2> I've changed </e2>  .  Im curious if anybody else has worked through anything like this. 
Skip breakfast	I'm not hungry	Long time lurker, first time poster.  Having a really hard time lately and figured this is a safe place to vent and maybe get some advice. Here's a breakdown of my days:Wake up, hit snooze 8 times.  Get out of bed at the last possible minute before I'd get to work so late I'd get fired.   <e1> Skip breakfast </e1>   because  <e2> I'm not hungry </e2>  .  Drive to work, think about having a productive day.  Take medication.  Make coffee.  Talk to co-workers.  Organize shit piles on my desk.  Maybe do one thing.  Move half my 'to-do list' items to tomorrow.  Take a longer lunch than I should, even though I didn't eat anything.  Come back convinced I'll do all the stuff I procrastinated from the morning. Lose track of my day.  Get distracted talking on IM.  Fall down a spiral of reading online articles.  Hear fellow female co-workers whispering and assume it's about me (Does Dani even work during the day? Every time I see her at her desk she's doing).  Shame and embarrassment and anger.  Okay
So,	suggestions?	So, it's been 60 days since I used fent and 6 days since I used kratom.  Super proud of myself! Gotta keep going.  Anybody else come out of withdraw and hate the way you didn't take care of yourself while using? Or that you did stuff you're not proud of? Trying to cope with negative memories. . i practice a lot of self compassion when i can, but some days I get really, really tired.  Any suggestions?
instantly started feeling miserably sad and my eyes were welling up	I want to go home all of a sudden	I'm on vacation.  I'm in a great mood, at such a high all day.  Just laid down in the bed to get comfy and  <e1> instantly started feeling miserably sad and my eyes were welling up </e1>   and I couldn't help but feel like  <e2> I want to go home all of a sudden </e2>  .  Wtffff. 
I've been feeling overwhelmed and depressed	I started seeing a therapist	I've been struggling at work and recently dropped out of school (trade school)  <e1> I've been feeling overwhelmed and depressed </e1>   so  <e2> I started seeing a therapist </e2>  .  She suggested I see a doctor about possible ADHD.  (Which I've suspected I might have for a while) After explaining to him my struggles with work and school and answering some questions about life and past performance in high school (which I barely passed) he said something that i've been thinking about all day.  He read over his notes and said, You know
Everyone	wow	Everyone has a different story but I'm just curious if for some people it got worse and worse until they thought, wow
She went on and on about how concerned she was	she thinks GC brother feels slighted that she helps me more financially	My therapist said to me last week you'll be ready to change your situation when you're in enough pain.  I feel like I'm there.  My parents do not love me.  Haircut sees me mostly as a financial inconvenience even though his revenue is excellent.  Screech uses me as either a bragging point or a woe is me cautionary tale for her friends.  I somehow managed to find both examples tonight.  Turns out she's still talking shit about me on the internet because of fucking course she is.   <e1> She went on and on about how concerned she was </e1>   because  <e2> she thinks GC brother feels slighted that she helps me more financially </e2>  .  GC brother doesn't want or need financial help.  So I'm not sure what this guilt fest is even about.  She went on to say that if she didn't help me
I asked him to drink some wine	I knew I was very drunk, and I knew that he wasn't at all	I posted about this in relationships, but it was taken down.  Last week, I went out for a few drinks with a uni friend, and we went back to my place and continued to drink/smoke weed.  After some time I totally blacked out.  I woke up the next morning with him telling me that we had sex.  My issue is that I don't believe he was nearly as drunk as me.  Before my memory just hits a wall, I remember him being totally sober.   <e1> I asked him to drink some wine </e1>   because  <e2> I knew I was very drunk, and I knew that he wasn't at all </e2>  .  I then remember him encouraging me to down the bottle of wine, to show him how to do it.  But there was only one bottle of wine in the house
Hi,	com/r/SDG5D25	Hi, I'm a high school student using surveys to research the effects of electronic use on the OCD-like symptoms in adolescents/teens ranging from the 12-18 years of age. I would really appreciate if you took this survey(linked down below) to help out my study! Thank you so much for  your help! surveymonkey. com/r/SDG5D25
I'm clearly not a non-smoker anymore	I'm disappointed in myself	After nearly two years I fell back in to it.  I'm not nearly as hooked as I was when I quit 6 years ago for 2 years or again when I quit for another 2 years.  (Seems like I have a problem 2 years in. . .  hmmm) Been smoking between 1-10 a day for the past few weeks.   <e1> I'm clearly not a non-smoker anymore </e1>  .   <e2> I'm disappointed in myself </e2>   but I know now that I'm capable of freeing myself from the addiction for 2 years, now I just need to string those two years together for about the next 60 years or so.  Anyway don't give in, whether it be 1 day or 10 years don't let a relapse become a lifelong habit.  Everyone makes mistakes but you decide how to handle those mistakes.  
I am conducting a survey on is there a link between anxiety in teens and suicidal thoughts	someone who has minor OCD, I wanted to reach out to other people like me and to also help spread awareness about the issue and to gain an idea of what can drive people to have these thoughts	Hi there! I am working on a culminating for my challenge and change class and  <e1> I am conducting a survey on is there a link between anxiety in teens and suicidal thoughts </e1>  .  The reason why I chose this subreddit for this was because has  <e2> someone who has minor OCD, I wanted to reach out to other people like me and to also help spread awareness about the issue and to gain an idea of what can drive people to have these thoughts </e2>  .  Anyway, I understand that this is a very sensitive/triggering topic and if you have any major issues with it ( ethical or otherwise), please feel free to message me.  Anyway if you take the time to do it, I thank you and I hope you a good day :)Here is the survey:  surveymonkey. com/r/ZJSRBFS
Today	much?	Today I had a nice talk with nice people, we laughed, we talked more serious stuff, even a little politics, I enjoyed it very much and it seemed both of them did too.  As soon as I had left them it started to creep up in me: anxiety, a big, sour frog in my throat which I still have right now hours later, even a little underlying panic and suddenly an obsessive and very critical thinking about what I had said and didn't I talk too much?
So	idekk	So this girl in my class for the past 2 days has been saying my name really loud in class and if I look at her she says what r u staring u? She keeps doing it then I like yelled STOP SAYING MY NAME and she laughed a little then like said why do U get so mad and I said it for someone else idek then she says it agajn .  Please help me!! What can I say so she fucks off for once w out showing any reaction that I'm pissed idekk
The	quit.	The are for the most part desperate to quit without wanting to put much effort in. just noticing the initial posts are all very similar, they are desperate to know how to quit, to get any tips to get rid of the drug. Thought that was interesting.  i think there is something in every smoker that wants to quit. 
totally on impulse after smoking my last bowl pack	I suck at self control	Yup  <e1> totally on impulse after smoking my last bowl pack </e1>   because  <e2> I suck at self control </e2>  .   So I picked up the whole plastic drawer set that I use for my stash, put it inside a bag of trash that was going out, and promptly walked outside and threw it in the dumpster before I could change my mind.   I was fine through the work day although it was a little weird not smoking on my lunch break.   It's really hitting me now though as usually I come home from a long day and plop down on the couch to watch tv and get baked.   I miss it so much :(    
We are going to throw a home party tonight	we are graduating	 <e1> We are going to throw a home party tonight </e1>   because  <e2> we are graduating </e2>  .  It is my 11th day.  My girlfriend smokes like a bloody Turk yet i found it even vitalising for myself for not to smoke.  It is not that all my college friends are heavy smokers.  Yeah, all 5 of them are heavy smokers.  It is the melancholy and the blues i feel makes me want to smoke tonight.  My girlfriend is smoking one and i don't even have to force my will for not to smoke.  It is relatively easy for me when someone smokes around.  But tonight, there will be booze and sadness.  And i don't want to fight for it tonight.  I want to spend my -most likely- last night with my fellas relaxed, with my smoke around.  When i am sad i want to smoke.  And i don't know how to resist tonight.  Help me out please.  Thanks, in advance.  Good luck to all of you.  
We	know?	We are on vacation, and I swear my husband is being so kind, patient and sweet.   I was about to consider divorce before we left I felt that he had been snappy, competitive, shut off, cold and selfish for months.   I asked him and he didn't feel angry, or unloving, or tense, or off color before our trip.  Is it me??? How would I know?
Ever	seriously	Ever hallucinate stuff that's just immensely annoying? I've been hearing this stupid loop of woodwindy, repetitive, irritating as shit music for two hours now.  I'm at work so I guess I should count my blessings given that this is pretty low on the spectrum of definitely not a hallucination you wanna be having on the job but seriously
Yesterday	much?	Yesterday I had a nice talk with nice people, we laughed, we talked more serious stuff, even a little politics, I enjoyed it very much and it seemed both of them did too.  As soon as I had left them it started to creep up in me: anxiety, a big, sour frog in my throat which I still have right now hours later, even a little underlying panic and suddenly an obsessive and very critical thinking about what I had said and didn't I talk too much?
I	washed.	I am wondering, what do you have in your bag/pockets in case you get bored anywhere you go? And if a bag is more convenient than a pocket since it's already got everything you could possibly want in there, while pocket needs to be emptied to be washed.  
I	it!	I was sure I was going to break my sobriety today.  I'm not openly admitting my alcoholism--I know this needs to happen, but I'm not there yet.  I knew in advance that I'd be with friends who drink and that alcohol would be a-plenty. I turned down drinks not once but nearly a dozen times today.  I almost convinced myself that I could have 1-2 and be able to stop.  Truthfully, I probably could have.  This time.  But I know how this cycle goes: later tonight or maybe tomorrow, I would be drinking again.  Within a week, I'd be back to blackout drunk. So today is the day I learned something cool about myself: my self-worth is more important than what others think of me.  Instead of giving in to peer pressure, I prioritized my own needs. I am feeling great right now.  I've got lots of pieces to put back together still, but I'm proud that today I did not (and will not) drink. If you're struggling, please remember that sobriety is a gift you can give yourself right now.  I'm not saying it's easy, but it is possible.  And you deserve it!
I'm glad	I'm sick not because of alcohol	All the while thinking,  <e1> I'm glad </e1>   this is because  <e2> I'm sick not because of alcohol </e2>  .  Small pleasures in life ey?
As	me.	As much as I want to sort everything out, I am tired of always having to be the one to apologize to her.  She always puts me down and it is really putting me in a dark place in my mind :(She always denied my depression, so she doesn't care how much her words impact me. 
I	too.	I feel less human and more some shitty mixologist's rendition of a melancholy cocktail concocted with ingredients delicately picked from the flaming gardens of Hell: anxiety, shame, self-hatred, loneliness, disgust, laziness, etc.  If only there was some fucking antifreeze inside me too. 
I	sleep	I don't care about anything anymore.  There is nothing that interests me.  Nothing that is exciting or fun, nothing feels important.  Everything I used to like became exhausting, boring and pointless.  Things like meeting friends, love, family, going out, nature, sports, games, films, books. And everytime I force myself to do something, like going for a walk, trying to enjoy it, I get annoyed, bored, disappointed after a short while.  Also, I can only get stuff done if someone literally forces me and stands behind me with a whip.  I just want to sleep
I	months.	I watch myself get hit by waves of intense emotions and I watch my bpd friends struggle with this as well.   I know I'm in it for the long haul, but is recovery real? I'm taking my meds and doing therapy and trying to use my DBT skills, but some days it still feels like I am doomed to be held back by this illness forever.   I think my friends often feel the same way, too.   I want to be able to commit to jobs, my education, and my relationships someday without having to worry about going crazy and self sabotaging every few months. 
I am just looking for a little encouragement	I have been feeling really down about this lately	Hi everyone, <e1> I am just looking for a little encouragement </e1>   since  <e2> I have been feeling really down about this lately </e2>  . So, ever since I can remember it has been clear to me that my father thinks I was/am overweight and wrong looking in various ways.   He was usually passive aggressive about telling me this.   Here are some examples of how my N-dad treated me and my sister: Almost every morning when I would wake up from the time I was a young girl
Tried an NA beer for the first time last night	Feeling so guilty this morning	 <e1> Tried an NA beer for the first time last night </e1>   out of curiosity.  After a few sips immediately got that familiar heady rush and just about threw the bottle across the room.   <e2> Feeling so guilty this morning </e2>   like I cheated and don't deserve my star.  I know it's only 0. 5% alcohol but unsure if I should ask for a reset.  Anyhow, just feeling down and needed to vent.  Thanks for reading.  
It's scares me	I've always had normal b. p but now for the past week it's been consistently high	 <e1> It's scares me </e1>  .   <e2> I've always had normal b. p but now for the past week it's been consistently high </e2>   (stage 2 hypertension. ) This needs to be my wake-up call! Drinking earlier in the day and a few nights ago I'm ashamed to say I fell and busted up my face on a tile floor.  Even more ashamed to admit I was carrying my toddler.  (At least having the reaction to save him from the fall, but what if it happens again?) So now I obviously feel like a horrible mother and still trying to fight off this craving. No AA meetings in my area where I can take my kids with me. . .  Reading This Naked Mind again and now I have the whole summer to keep up with my 2 kids so I have to finally do this.  Just a venting post, thanks for providing a safe place for me to get this out. 
.	coworkers	. . .  or anything of that sort like thats the way the world works or thats the hand we are dealt.  Whenever i fucking hear this i just want to strangle the person saying it.  It's basically just a huge middle finger to my face when people say it. Here comes the rant. . .  i am a 21 year old depressed autistic man.  I hate my job and my coworkers
.	haha	. . . . 6/7 days cleanfuck you nicotine, suck my dick.  you have no fucking power anymore over me.  Fuck this drug, i will never smoke again. Stopping was fucking HARD.  but im so so so so o glad i stopped smoking cigs a few months ago, and ive stopped vaping now :)im so happy now haha
Call	conversation	Call it [Immersion Therapy]( wikipedia. org/wiki/Immersion_therapy). Partially out of loneliness, partially out of needing a hobby, partially hoping it would cure my SA, I started a podcast meant for a local public radio station. On this show, I walk around with a microphone and stop people on the street, asking them hypothetical questions. Of course, when I started I felt very awkward about stopping random strangers on the street and interviewing them.  But after the initial hump, it became rather easy. Really, doing interviews like this doesn't require you to speak much.  But I think, for me, just having people speak to me, and necessarily needing to ask follow-up questions, in my opinion, is the absolute best training you can get for overcoming SA.  It's not a ormal conversation
if we were isolated somewhere with no chance of acquiring cigarettes whatsoever, quitting would almost be natural	there's really nothing we can do	I feel like  <e1> if we were isolated somewhere with no chance of acquiring cigarettes whatsoever, quitting would almost be natural </e1>   because  <e2> there's really nothing we can do </e2>  .  But what makes it worse, at least for me, is that I have the option to walk down the block at any second and buy a pack.  I have the option to go out and bum a smoke from any random person.  I have to control myself not to do it, and that's the hardest part. 
I	us.	I had a great day at work yesterday.  Yet all I could do when I got home was battle the overwhelming sensation of knowing so many people looked at me, interacted with me and possibly saw me do something embarrassing.  Deep down I know everything went well and I did not humiliate myself in any way.  Yet, when everyone else is sleeping, I can't shake the annoying feeling of hyper-awareness.  It's as if the spotlight is still on me, even though I am safe alone in my house.  I'm sure this happens to many of us.  
experiencing second hand smoke	I woke up with a sore throat and saw blood after blowing my nose	I went to my parents house recently, and where we all gather is out on the porch.  Everyone drinks, relaxes, and some smoke.  After two days of hanging out back there  <e1> experiencing second hand smoke </e1>  ,  <e2> I woke up with a sore throat and saw blood after blowing my nose </e2>  .  I am so glad I quit, and so happy that I don't have to have that as my daily reality anymore.  Seeing a glimpse of my old symptoms was shocking.  I'm proud of myself for sticking with this.  
I used drugs to numb myself and surrounded myself with fake friends	I ended up saying doing a lot of things that I shouldn't have and blew a lot of money, especially on coke	I went on a bit of a bender three weeks ago, it was kind of the culmination of my drug use.  Lowest point in my life and  <e1> I used drugs to numb myself and surrounded myself with fake friends </e1>   (party type users) and blacked out.   <e2> I ended up saying doing a lot of things that I shouldn't have and blew a lot of money, especially on coke </e2>  .  That shit really drains your bank account.  Anyway, coming down off that week was really like waking up from a coma.  It was pretty scary not remembering anything you did or why people wouldn't talk to me anymore or why I had terrible nosebleeds.  I'm not sure, something just clicked and even though I'd tried many times before to get sober I'm sticking to it this time, longer than I have in about five years.  I guess it takes hitting the ones you love and truly hitting rock bottom to be able to start over. 
I	.	I am a lurker of this group but I want to start engaging more.  Reading all of your thoughts, your victories and similar stories to mine. .  it gave me courage do to something yesterday I was terrified to do.  I was so anxious but I did it.  If I can face my fears, so can you.  I'm severely debilitated with panic disorder/panic attacks/social anxiety but I am not going down without a fight and I encourage you all to do the same.  Get a little help, medication and support.  Take care of yourselves.  Be brave and jump in, face the demons with me &lt;3 Thank you all for sharing your stories. . 
It's	pills	It's 4 months since I'm taking antidepressants (brintellix) and I'm getting worse.  I'm a 30 y. o guy dealing with a breakup and unemployment since fabruary, but now I think about suicide almost every day.  I was sad but not depressed before.  I wanna stop taking these pills
I found myself with nothing to do	I decided reluctantly that I would turn on my gaming pc to kill an hour	I realized how much I don't play games anymore when  <e1> I found myself with nothing to do </e1>   yesterday so  <e2> I decided reluctantly that I would turn on my gaming pc to kill an hour </e2>  .  After 5 minutes of playing (Picking my save file) I literally took 3 steps in this virtual world and realized how bored I was and promptly shut off my computer.  I was addicted for many years and now the only time I find myself playing is when my brother and I decide to game together once a week.  Funny how life changes right? A year ago I would have never thought that I would give up gaming. 
My girlfriend was angry at me	being selfish	I already already told my story several times here but I need to exteriorize stuff. I'm a 20yo student in computer science/software dev, last year I moved to a new university, in the same city as my girlfriend was studying in. I don't know exactly what happened but I fell into depression without noticing it.  The cause is probably this new environment, I failed at making friends at the uni.  The courses/teachers are globally bad.  I was overqualified and people made me feel like shit.  <e1> My girlfriend was angry at me </e1>   for  <e2> being selfish </e2>  
My folks think I'm lazy	They don't know I've felt this way since I was 10	I turn 24 in 2 months.  I've been out of school 4 years without a job.  Do a little of freelance but mostly rely on my parents.  I hit rock bottom 2 years ago.  I used to sleep with my hands underneath my body to stop from hurting myself.  Got therapy on the side which helped but couldn't afford it anymore.   <e1> My folks think I'm lazy </e1>  .  That I've been bumming about.   <e2> They don't know I've felt this way since I was 10 </e2>  .  Nothing traumatic in my life has happened.  They wouldn't believe me if I told them.  The last time I had a job I actively tried to kill myself several times.  I'm afraid that might happen again no matter what job I manage to land.  I cant drive.  I can hardly use an ATM.  Negative comments from family daily make it harder to fight for myself.  I have no ambition and I've never felt love so what is there to live for?
i care about how she is	she's been pretty manic for a week	My wife hit me again, she kicked me in the groin and bit me until she drew blood, and in a new turn of events she headbutted me in the nose and made me bleed a whole lot of blood. I cant even think straight right now, and the most heart aching thing is that  <e1> i care about how she is </e1>   because  <e2> she's been pretty manic for a week </e2>  . What do I do or think of this? What do you think or make of domestic abuse in manic periods?
I feel nervous about hanging out with this girl	she seems like a heavy drinker	Sometimes I have trouble listening to my gut.  I just started a new job, I'm currently in a sober house but not for much longer.  I work a decent program - meetings daily, sponsor, steps, solid support network, daily routine, exercise, hygiene, overall good diet, honest most of the time.  Anyways, at my job, I've met a girl and both of us seem fond of each other.  She definitely seems like a heavy drinker, and booze was one of my drugs of choice.  It's been a long time since I've had any relationship with a girl, since September 2015.  My drug use continued to progress then, I also have a serious porn addiction that I am in recovery for as well. My point is,  <e1> I feel nervous about hanging out with this girl </e1>   cause  <e2> she seems like a heavy drinker </e2>  , but I don't need to spend time with her.  Anyone had any good or bad experiences related to relationships/sex in early recovery?
my depression has reeeeally been hitting me hard	I have a lack of motivation to clean my room, do laundry, etc. , all I want to do is sleep, watch tv, play games and not much else	I live with my parents and  <e1> my depression has reeeeally been hitting me hard </e1>  .   <e2> I have a lack of motivation to clean my room, do laundry, etc. , all I want to do is sleep, watch tv, play games and not much else </e2>  . Some context: I've lost my insurance and trying to gain new insurance is making me pick between my specialists (psychiatrist, neurologist, rheumatologist for fibromyalgia, etc) or my usual primary care.  I cannot have both.  I feel really helpless and suicidal on occasion (I'm alright as of now)Does anyone know how I can get it through my parents head that I'm NOT doing okay?
I've	life.	I've wanted to kill myself since I was about 8 and I don't really have that many happy memories.  I've never really NOT been depressed; to my recollection anyway.  I vaguely remember being normal when I was 4-6ish, but I don't think kids are really lucid enough during that time to form memories, at least I wasn't really.  It must be really nice to actually have something to compare your despair to rather than just wondering how anyone could possibly enjoy life.  
I can't even have regular convos with people	I am annoyed hearing them talk	They feel annoyed by EVERY DARN thing on this planet???!! Like  <e1> I can't even have regular convos with people </e1>   because  <e2> I am annoyed hearing them talk </e2>  !!! Okay that was a bit of an exaggeration but you get the point 
I am addicted to being high	it makes me eat unhealthy.  It causes me sleep deprivation.  It keeps me isolated from others.  It creates memory loss.  It kills my motivation.  It puts my career at risk.  It prevents me from being the best version of myself	Getting high used to be something I did occasionally with friends.  Over the past couple of years however, it's progressed into a daily habit.  It's a constant yearning and as soon as I have an opportunity, I take it.   <e1> I am addicted to being high </e1>  .  But,  <e2> it makes me eat unhealthy.  It causes me sleep deprivation.  It keeps me isolated from others.  It creates memory loss.  It kills my motivation.  It puts my career at risk.  It prevents me from being the best version of myself </e2>  .  I enjoy being high and hope that I can partake in moderation one day, but I know I need to prove to myself I don't need it.  Thank you for your time and encouragement. 
has	situations	has anyone written suicide notes before and went back to read them after a while. .  It's strangeI keep an online diary to track how I'm feeling every once in a while.  It's funny to reread how I was feeling about certain situations
Would	you	Would appreciate Chicago-Adhd'ers assist. . . .  My therapist decided she's overwhelmed and kind of . . .  fired me :/ Can anyone recommend a therapist that is very familiar with adult ADHD  that accepts BCBS FHP insurance? My insurance provider's directory does not list specialty and isn't really up-to-date.  Thank you
but I'm afraid to call out	of fear or someone hearing me	I know there are hotlines  <e1> but I'm afraid to call out </e1>    <e2> of fear or someone hearing me </e2>  .   Is there some kind of online text chat equivalent?  Or maybe a situation where they talk and I type?  Please don't recommend 7cup I hate that place.  
Tl;Dr:	issue?	Tl;Dr: Sometimes I feel like I can receive and understand a message, like when I'm reading a book, but I also have that feeling that I'm not really getting it. Do you ever feel like you can hear (or read) the words, you also understand them but the message is simply not sticking into you?You may even not be distracted by other thoughts but still, you just don't get the concept.  Like the mind is not there to store it in our memory. If that's still not clear enough, think about a computer where you stick in a usb drive.  You can open all the files and read them but if you try to copy on the machine the operation fails. I wonder if it may simply be lack of sleep or being tired, but I wonder if the same happens to you?Any advice to solve this issue?
I've been drinking a lot (separate not so bad problem) and always crave but never given in	it's the one thing I'm proud of	I've smoked for 7 years and quit now. I'm 69 days smoke free and it has gotten easier, like I stopped using my Nicolette mints (they were sooooo good thou very very helpful) so I've been nicotine free for like a month or something.   <e1> I've been drinking a lot (separate not so bad problem) and always crave but never given in </e1>   cos  <e2> it's the one thing I'm proud of </e2>  , each day I wake up happy I didn't give in.  But I also suffer from depression and keep having 
So	a	So I have this thing about speaking on the phone.  I am extremely awkward.  I don't know what to say, I keep dreading the awkward silence; I keep repeating stupid words (and sounds to be honest - like short quack-y laughs and chuckles); etc.  One thing I've learned is to wait for the other person to say something, and then just respond with a 
Well	days!	Well its day 36 and I can say I'm 99% of normal.  Still have slight fatigue and low mood  (wouldn't really call it depression ) but it's there.  Sleep is just about back to normal now too.  Was really hoping I would be 100% by now.  Guess I'll just keep counting the days!
She said that she had realized she wasn't happy being with me. ,	I'm in shock at the moment. ,	I have known my bipolar SO for 8 years and we dated for 4, we were high school sweethearts.  I was there when she was diagnosed with BPD.  I helped her do research.  We learned, adapted, and grew together.  We moved out of our parent's houses and in together at college. A few months ago we were the strongest we had ever been when she got an offer to go on an acting tour for a month.  She was hesitant but I encouraged her to go on this adventure. She got back on Sunday and stayed no more than a few hours before telling me she was leaving. I had heard it before but this time it was different, it was her saying it.  She wasn't manic or depressive.  She wasn't in hysterics and running out the door.  She came here again today to get some of her things and she sat me down a couple minutes ago and told me that she doesn't love me anymore, not like she did.  , <e1> She said that she had realized she wasn't happy being with me. , </e1>  , <e2> I'm in shock at the moment. , </e2>  I guess this is where I get off this crazy ride.  
There's	before?	There's a certain person in my DBT group therapy who really triggers me.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how to help this situation or if you ever experienced this before?
The past two years have taken everything from me.  I don't know how to move on from it	I feel like my life has become a jump from one tragedy to the next	 <e1> The past two years have taken everything from me.  I don't know how to move on from it </e1>  .   <e2> I feel like my life has become a jump from one tragedy to the next </e2>  .  I'm so tired of trying, of having to pretend to be happy to be alive.  I'm ready to give up.  I wouldn't consider suicide; I just want to passively cease to exist.  
I	ideas.	I am going through a low point.  What self care do you do when you are going through a low point?  <e1> If my job didn't demand my complete attention 24/7, in a perfect world where I would be allowed to take a sick day or a leave of absence without worrying about losing my home </e1>  , I think  <e2> I would rest </e2>  .  Unplug every device in the house, bundle up and take a nap on the couch.  Do that for an entire day.  My boss says if I just eat sweet potatoes and kale and stop eating dairy and sugar, I will get better.  My brother says if I exercise I will feel better.  My doctor says if I take these pills, I will feel better.  My Facebook friend says if I don't take the pills I will feel better.  20 years of conflicting bullshit.  I have taken the pills.  I have not taken the pills.  I have exercised.  I have not exercised.  I have eaten healthy and not eaten healthy.  Nothing works.  So what do you do when you're feeling low? I need ideas.  
I've been feeling depressed	thinking about why I even exist	 <e1> I've been feeling depressed </e1>   for a while, and was just sitting in my little corner in school, at home, at work, and just  <e2> thinking about why I even exist </e2>  .  But then I saw this car that I really wanted (honda beat) at a used car lot, and I started to imagine myself driving up in the mountains with my guitar in the passenger seat, making the car dance through the corners, reaching the top of the mountain.  I got exited, so happy that I teared up.  I remembered why I need to live.  I found a purpose in life! I can work my way to that goal of saving money and buying my dream car.  So I guess what I'm trying to say is, try to remember what inspires you and makes you happy, and if you can set a goal to get there I'm sure anyone could achieve it. 
I have lost myself	Become bitter and heartless	 <e1> I have lost myself </e1> .   <e2> Become bitter and heartless </e2>  .  A failure to those around me.  To those who care. They'll be better tomorrow.  And I'll be elsewhere.  
Hey	way?	Hey guys when I started meds this image kept popping into my head and I'm wondering if anyone can relate? So when I imagine my brain/thoughts before meds I imagine a sort of pensive (like from HP) swirling with ideas that I am thinking all at once.  Occasionally, certain ideas skim the surface so I can get a better look at them and kind've string together a thought, but often times it's more of a game of association between the thoughts I can glimpse and related thoughts.  But on the meds, complete thoughts stream under the surface so I can get a good look at them or pluck them out of the water.  It's a super weird image but I was curious if anyone felt this way?
she is a picky eater, and basically lives off of chips and soda	She is slightly underweight	Hi.  So, I am horrible at explaining situations so please bear with me here.  Basically, my little sister is 15 and I am here because she passed out in school today.  I already knew that  <e1> she is a picky eater, and basically lives off of chips and soda </e1>  .   <e2> She is slightly underweight </e2>   as a result and I worry a lot.  However, I live two hours away with my other to sisters and there isn’t much that I can do.  She lives with my grandmother (who is narcassistic as hell and bitter to top it off), my mother (a hollow shell of a woman), and my little brother (17) My grandmother used to cook, but today I learned that she has stopped because they aren't going to eat it anyway or they don't even say thank you.  I know that both of those points are valid
Shoutout	me.	Shoutout to all the attractive people out there who have zero clue that I would've been ecstatic if they came up and talked to me.  
I've been suffering with severe depression and anxiety	I've been prescribed 30mg propranolol a day	I went to the doctor today and told him  <e1> I've been suffering with severe depression and anxiety </e1>   for a while.   <e2> I've been prescribed 30mg propranolol a day </e2>   (3 10mg tablets).  I've heard that propranolol can actually worsen depression.  is this true? It also lessens the physical symptoms of anxiety.  Even though I get pretty bad physical symptoms it's the mental symptoms that are stopping me from doing anything in life.  It's taken me years to finally seek help and I'm not sure if this is even the right drug for me.  ironically, I'm now feeling anxious that this medication won't work. 
I'm rarely sick and have never had a serious accident	I'm not too worried about doctor's visits	Starting in August I'll need to go on Covered CA.   <e1> I'm rarely sick and have never had a serious accident </e1>  , so  <e2> I'm not too worried about doctor's visits </e2>  .  However, I'll need to continue being on my meds if I want to function like a semi-normal human (you all understand).  My biggest issue is that I'm on a seemingly rare drug, Methylphenidate HCL CD CR 30Mg to be exact.  Whenever I have had to switch insurance or doctors in the past, I've always had trouble for the first couple of months getting my meds.  Is anyone else on their state insurance and can give some insight on their experience with getting their meds?
He doesn't have a phone, and he has barely any energy and gets socially anxious	he is unable to	My friend has been suicidal for the last few months.   Today, he decided to withdraw from our friend group more, and told me he wishes he was dead.   His situation has suddenly gotten worse over the last few days, and his girlfriend and I both agree that he needs to get crisis help.  However, he has no one that would call it for him, as his mom brushes everything we tell her off, and we live in an entirely different country from him.   <e1> He doesn't have a phone, and he has barely any energy and gets socially anxious </e1>  , so  <e2> he is unable to </e2>  .  We don't know what to do.   He needs help very soon, but he has no way to get it. 
Started	well	Started with some night time anxiety after lying down .  Took 10 deep breathes .  And it went away .  These things work well 
Just	you.	Just checking in.  Since getting sober 80 days ago, I've left behind almost all of my friendships, and lost several very close friends earlier for different reasons.  Today I really felt it.  I had an long, overwhelming day at work, and I wish I had someone close to vent to, laugh with, and spend time with tonight.  But I am sober.  I'm getting more sleep, I'm eating better food, and I'm on the right track.  Things aren't going to be perfect, but I'm glad I'm experiencing life more clearly now.  I'm glad I'm learning different ways to handle my feelings.  And I'm glad I'm on this path with all of you.  
I	Well	I am struggling with quitting again.  Big Shocker, right? Long story short, I quit for 4 months, started up again a couple months ago, and now I am trying to stop again.  When I am in full stoner mode, I smoke all day every day.  When I quit before, I quit cold turkey, and suffered with the withdrawals.  This time though, I didn't get rid of all my stuff.  I gave several OZ away to friends, but I did keep a small stash hidden away in a drawer.  Why? Honestly, I don't know.  Maybe I kept it In Case of Emergency.  I guess whatever excuse I can come up with would be BS.  Well
I	being	I swear, I feel my fucking sanity going to the toilet.  I have other problems than just anxiety.  Today, I just want to run, I don't want to be nearby people, I want to be alone, my hands are shaking a bit. I am at my office right now, I just need to get the hell out. I am not a mad man, I just need help. People just don't understand and I don't expect them to, but sometimes being 
we've	of	we've been together a few months now, she has only had about 2 including the most recent, but she usually have panic attacks at work, ive talked her through it over the phone both times, and we had even asked her boss if she could leave early, thankfully she let us, very nice lady, im worried that if she has another panic attack, what will i do then if i cant take her away from the stress. i need to know if there is anything i can do mainly over text, texting is our standard form of communication and i can usually calm her down by saying things along the lines of 
I've	hoo!	I've thought about suicide since i was a teenager.  for the past few years, i've thought about it everyday.  its like an imaginary friend that's tempting me to touch it; it'll come to life right when i die.  I take two steps forward and two steps back, over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.  I could talk about that girl i miss, or the dreams i lost, or the disappointment i feel.  I could talk about the infinite struggle, the hopeless quest, the pointless existence. . but you already know all that, don't you.  we all know how its gonna end, don't we? why are we biding our time? what are we waiting for? another 'chance'? another 'break'? and then what. .  then its the same.  we always come back here, just like we're destined to.  boo fuckin' hoo!
I	person?	I am 28, I have been working 9-5 jobs since 23 and I absolutely hate it.  Was wondering if there is any successful careers out there as a an anxious person?
will absolutely be insulted	if I don't	My friend is getting married.  I have to go to the wedding, because he  <e1> will absolutely be insulted </e1>   <e2> if I don't </e2> .  The problem is that my ex is probably going to be there as well.  The thaught of seeing her makes me so anxsious that it's just crippling.  I have been devastated since the breakup and seing her will probably completely destroy me. Today I had to go puke at work.  I haven't slept all night and my chest hurts since yesterday hal of the time.  I breathe like an animal and can't think about anything else except about her. 
was diagnosed with GAD	wondering	I  <e1> was diagnosed with GAD </e1>  which is my first time dealing with it.   I've been slowly getting better with meditation, exercise, and acceptance.   With Xanax medication when I need it.  So I'm  <e2> wondering </e2>  if any has ever experienced what I'm going through.   Mostly happens at night, it has to do with feeling anxious.   Like restlessness leg syndrome is the best way i can describe it, but like a nervous anxious feeling in my feet, but also my hands.   From time to time I feel like its my chest.   I take xanax when it gets bad, I sleep but I still have the feeling.  I've taken maybe 6 Xanax pill in the last 2 weekends.   Taking it every other days.   So far havent taken it in 4 days.   Lately in the mornings my head feels spacey, and like full pressure.   Weird aches come to my head and behind my eyes.   It's mostly the mornings, but the aches come about 2-4 times a day.  It's freaking me out.   I don't know if I should as my doc to order a MRI.   Or if I'm just over reacting.   Amy ever experience this?
stopped seeing a therapist	financial reasons	What am I supposed to think about her comment? It's hurting me and making me even more depressed.  I'm really entrenched in the insanity of having two narc parents and a narcissistic family right now, my brain is really fried I can't even remember who I am and what I stand for.  Since I  <e1> stopped seeing a therapist </e1>  for  <e2> financial reasons </e2> , I'm reverting back to the teenage me who was always confused and dissociated.  Pretty sure everything she is saying I am internalising on some level.  Her reasons for feeling this way is because I stopped talking to her and she said the therapy messed me up (nope, I never felt more like myself and able to have boundaries and unpack my emotions with a therapist).  Honestly what she said is really getting to me, I feel guilty about even doing therapy for a year.  She has complete control over me right now ffs I feel like I'm being brainwashed or something
got annoyed with him	hadn't done what he was supposed to have done	This one was going really well.  I was quite well respected, was responsible for hiring.  I'd hired an employee a week ago and he was really good.  The problem was he clearly had ADHD too.  Today, I  <e1> got annoyed with him </e1>  because he <> <e2> hadn't done what he was supposed to have done </e2> .  In an impulsive fit of madness I yelled, swore, and stormed out whilst resigning.  I think that's job number 15 I've resigned from for no good reason other than being unable to control my implusivness :(**TL;DR** FML; Need hugs
I'm	advice?	I'm afraid of having to take meds forever against weed-induced DPDR and comorbid depression.  I've never really suffered from depression but the current feeling of hopelessness is so bad.  I'm starting therapy soon but I'm afraid of getting dependent on anti-depressants for life. . . Any advice?
I	rant	I try not to be a Debbie downer but it's soul crushing each time I see my reflection, shadow, or my face.  It's also depressing when you see a girl you like but she doesn't like you like. . I can't imagine being 80, uglier, more bitter and still a virgin.  I'm still trying to improve my life in other ways but it's an everyday challenge to stay motivated. . . sorry just had to rant
blows my mind	that was not a word people would tie to me	Diagnosed and medicated over a couple of months now (vyv, 40mg).  At work, I'm somehow SOOOOOO busy now.  I'm always on the go, always getting something done, always staying late.  Granted, my boss and pretty much everyone else has commented on my organization, my efficiency, my work ethic.  The organization thing still  <e1> blows my mind </e1>  because  <e2> that was not a word people would tie to me </e2> .  Ask my mom.  Lol.  I'm really proud of myself.  Anyway, I'm just trying to figure out after 22 years of going undiagnosed. . .  How much more could I have done leading up to this point had I been diagnosed earlier.  It really makes you think.  And still, wtf am I always so busy all of a sudden? Wtf was I doing before??
So	help?	So I've been doing good over the last week.  But idk I feel empty.  Like idk I just don't wanna do anything but lay in my bed.  And idk if I'm depressed.  But me practically not being afraid of suicide makes me think I will do it.  I like hanging with friends like I do daily, but I just don't necessarily feel happy just laying here. .  any advice to help?
I'm	to.	I'm so sad right now and want to burst in tears.  I have nobody to talk to my life about.  No friends, no girlfriend, no family.  I wish I had someone that legitimately cared about how I'm doing or how I feel.  Instead I'm just looking at the posts of others on this sub and trying to find people to relate to. 
so tired of turning down plans	haven't had time to prepare	I'm  <e1> so tired of turning down plans </e1>  because I  <e2> haven't had time to prepare </e2>  for them.  It seems like everyone that ever wants to hang out/meet with me wants to do so while I'm in the middle of something and I find myself constantly pushing towards rescheduling even if I'm completely free.  Social interactions never used to stress me out like this, the idea of telling someone I'd be able to hang out every time you asked if you just gave me a bit of a heads up  is basically what I need. .  but i can't muster up the guts to say it Tl:dr; rambles.  Short notice plans stress me out and it feels like I push myself away from my friends.  
don't want to burden anyone	try my best to keep it inside	Doing mathematics or watching something on the television keeps me distracted but I wish it wasn't like this.  What's the point of studying or even breathing when I don't find anything exciting/interesting? I  <e1> don't want to burden anyone </e1>  with my thoughts so I  <e2> try my best to keep it inside </e2>  of me but I am just so used to them now, that I feel empty like a vessel with a black hole. 
It's	marathon.	It's Saturday again, which means it's time to look back on the week and be proud of our little victories.  Whether you climbed out of bed or to a new apex of achievement, let's take a moment to celebrate these victories.  Sometimes little things can be really hard.  Today let's take a moment to celebrate having done the hard things, whether they were taking a shower or running a marathon. 
Hey	advice.	Hey everyone! 2 months smoke free!!!! Whoohooo!!!! It honestly doesn't even seem as if it has been that long.  Feels like I quit merely weeks ago.  Yet when I was smoking, a few days or a week without seemed infinitely longer.   It's still an ongoing battle to not fall into old habits, but I've been successful thus far.  Last night was was exceptionally difficult.  My band played a gig last night that was anything but great.  Murphy's Law was in full effect.  I was extremely angry and embarrassed about it afterwards.  I wanted nothing more than to say fuck it and buy a pack and get absolutely smashed at the bar, but I didn't.  I left the venue, went to del taco and spite ate.  I've never been more proud of myself.  I overcame the urge.  This subreddit has been a cornerstone to my success and I would like to thank everyone for their support and advice. 
Hi,	thoughts.	Hi, I have OCD (was diagnosed when I was 10, but remember having it long before. ) I actually no longer have compulsions at all but instead, I have Pure O which I have just learned about today! I'm glad I'm not the only one who has this.  Generally mine is manageable, I take Citalopram (Celexa) and have for years, I don't consider it severe at all.  But when the obsessions do come, it feels like my heart is breaking.  I hate the feeling and I become so bothered and so sad.  I was in therapy practicing ways to cope with it, but I am not currently going, I found it less helpful than I'd hoped.  I would like to see if anyone has any advice for dealing with obsessive thoughts. 
So	sex?	So I cannot seem to hold down a long term relationship, so whenever I do have sex, it's terrible.  I'm self conscious during it and I never ever orgasm, but the worst part is after.  When the guys leave, I cannot masturbate or think about sex without feeling filthy and disgusting.  How do I get past this idea that I'm gross for having sex?
Long	luck!	Long time lurker, first time poster.  I came across this subreddit about a week ago and was really inspired and motivated by the stories of success and fulfilment shared by everyone in this sub.  About a year ago, I completely quit games for a month, and I was so productive.  I was writing up a business plan for a business that I wanted to set up, constantly going to the gym and very conscious of my actions, thoughts, emotions and decisions.  I went overseas, broke up with my now-ex girlfriend and relapsed hard.  So today will mark the first day of me giving up games and taking more action in growing and becoming a better person.  Wish me luck! 
do not drink	it might affect my medication	I just hung out with a bunch of friends after our first year of college.  All of them had great stories about getting drunk, playing strip poker, getting laid, and just getting to know people.  When it got to my turn, I had nothing.  I realize that I am an isolated introvert who can't find new friends (let alone girls) and that I  <e1> do not drink </e1>  due to  <e2> it might affect my medication </e2>  (although alcohol does taste horrible).  I want to have some decent stories to share, but I'm not willing to attend parties and social gatherings (to many people).  Is it my fate to be the dull friend in my group or am I too strict about my lifestyle?
Really,	abuse.	Really, is telling a kid to drop it, let it go, get over it, and so on, in angry or frustrated tones, equivalent to telling them to shut up? Any reasons why or why not.  I mean, if told my mom next time she says this that she's telling me to shut up she'd snap at that not being what she said and my twisting her words.  But do these convey the same thing? Also, I'm leaning towards them being the same myself.  Can we think of other equivalents that help explain even the not immediately horrible sounding verbal abuse.  
How	dynamics	How does a Nfamily dynamic begin? Is it with a single N in the family? Do Nfamilies share a type of mental disorder? If so many Nfamilies exist worldwide, I assume there would be some type of disorder involved.  Are they just in a deep denial and/or ignorance about their broken dynamic? I believe I've seen some strong denial in my family. . . I've seen how cruel certain members can be in such a subtle, covert way, yet everyone turns a blind eye.  I'm beginning to think that they don't have the courage to accept how cruel certain family members can be.  I've read that Nfamilies care more about their image than the quality of the family itself.  This is obviously the case for my Nfamily.  But I just don't understand how other families have the same dynamics
so anxious about him cheating on me or fancying someone else	keeps me up at night	my boyfriend is going away for a month soon and this will be our first time being apart in the like 10ish months we've been dating.  i'm  <e1> so anxious about him cheating on me or fancying someone else </e1>  that it  <e2> keeps me up at night </e2> .  I know logically he would never cheat on me, but i think my bpd/ocd makes me super obsessive and paranoid.  a lot of times when a partner leaves, i also tend to 'split' and just decide 'fuck it i don't care about them anymore'.  i also don't want that to happen but i am worried i can feel it starting already and i don't know what to do.  how do i cope please help :( 
I	job.	I just graduated college a few weeks ago and am really not happy about finding a job. 
okay with	it does seem to help in moderation	That she insists is not happening.  We are having a birthday party for our youngest at the swim club we are members of.   She is being super chatty, she snuck away to smoke some pot (which if she's depressed I'm  <e1> okay with </e1>  because  <e2> it does seem to help in moderation </e2> ), her friend snuck in a really strong mixed drink they're both sipping on.  Her narcissism is amped up and i.  see the dirty looks she throws my way.  The kicker, she was talking to a parent about beer and he's a microbrew fan. . .  cool. . .  who isn't nowadays. . .  he rattles off a list of 
I	on.	I am on my way to an AA meeting to pick up a 17-year medallion.   What a journey.   If you are just starting out on the road called 'recovery,' hang in there.   I had very limited ideas of what a sober life was supposed to be all about.   But I got involved in the AA program, got a sponsor, did steps, did service work, sponsored others.   I expected things to be safe and boring, something I knew nothing about in the first place, but that seemed preferable to the chaos and downward spiral that was my previous life.   I was wrong.   I've been to tropical islands to live, been stuck in isolated little nowhere towns, been wealthy, been broke and near homeless, owned my own business, lost it, been in a career, been shuttled from job to job, been in a relationship, been alone.  Life's adventures keep happening, and staying sober, and keeping sight of the spiritual nature of the 12 steps, has been worth the sweat and effort.   Thanks to this sub for keeping us sobernauts connected, and allowing me to celebrate my recovery today outside my circle of IRL friends.  Y'all keep on keeping on. 
I've	1!	I've wanted to quit for a while.  My wife's family drinks, my friends and cousins drink, basically everyone around me drinks.  I've always been bad at handling alcohol and often regret drinking and my associated actions.  I'm reading this naked mind.  I think I want to quit but I have a vacation (in a few months) planned with drinkers and feel super uncomfortable turning down drinks.  Its something we've bonded over  in there past .  I'm sure many of you can relate.   I'm going to try anyways.  Wish me luck.  Day 1!
I	again!	I quit and I am on day 4 and still getting major cravings and still i'm still an angry jerk.  I will stay a non smoker for good and I have been jogging every night which makes me realize what 20 years of smoking did to me.  I can not run 1/4 a mile without being out of breath but I will change that.   I needed to vent and i need some support.  I never want to smoke again! 
The	run	The strangest thing about depression is, despite its name, that it can be so intensely overstimulating.  This cold, urgently electric anxiety telling you everything is wrong, fighting the blacker than black, sludge like darkness that drags you down like concrete shoes, like a ball and chain.  Your head is screaming run
I	distraction	I just want to hurt myself so badly right now.  I want to cut my wrists and watch the blood drip down to the floor.  I want to feel pain.  I want to hurt.  I deserve it.  I'm drunk and and I'm miserable and I don't know what to do.  I promised my boyfriend I wouldn't cut myself or hurt myself anymore.  I guess this just me reaching out, begging someone to distract me.  I'm so sorry for posting this.  I'm so embarrassed .  I just need a distraction 
God	embarrassed	God I feel fucking terrible. . .  I was going to write an essay but then went absolute nuts but anyway does anyone relate to the following  So I'll think back to things I've done and said or not said in the past and just feel overcome by shame and embarrassment and I'll cringe so incredibly intensely and roll around on the floor or the bed and start hitting myself or something and just feel so fucking goddamn embarrassed 
could never really understand	they're so harmful and tragic	Drug abuse, self harm, suicide, etc.  Before, I always thought there must be a better alternative.  I  <e1> could never really understand </e1>  why people took these paths when  <e2> they're so harmful and tragic </e2> .  Now, it just makes sense.  Going the other way isn't any better.  Even if you're drug free and no longer self harming, you're still stuck in this miserable life.  There's nothing in it for you.  My life isn't any better because I make healthier choices for my body.  The problem is that there aren't choices to make for my mind.  That can never be fixed with a lifestyle change.  That ultimately leads to not caring.  And I don't care anymore.  I wouldn't care if everything I have was taken away.  I wouldn't care if I died.  I wish I did just die.  I wouldn't care if drugs made my body toxic and dead or if my arms were covered in bloody cuts.  People say I have to care about something, and maybe I do.  But what I definitely don't care about is living this kind of life.  Drugs, addictions, harmful behavior, death.  It all feels better than living like this. 
anyone has any tips to help me calm down enough to sleep	I would greatly appreciate	Some shit has gone down in my life and I'm currently trying to sleep, but I'm a giant, snotty, wet faced mess and can't keep the panic down.  I've taken my meds but they aren't kicking in very well right now.  I have a history of cutting to deal with my anxiety and I have been good for over a year now, but this is truly testing my self control.  If  <e1> anyone has any tips to help me calm down enough to sleep </e1> ,  <e2> I would greatly appreciate </e2>  any and all advice. 
The	used?	The mental health services in my country are poor.  I want to try online therapy but I'm concerned over certain things like:It being a waste of time and money.  The session being secretly recorded.  If anyone has experiences with this, could you share your experience as well as what site you used? 
im	:DD	im not depressed though im quite happy even though i laze around and do nothing all day :DD
Does	time.	Does anyone else only feel depressed the first couple hours of being awake and then it subsides? I've been doing fine lately but this morning I woke up and just felt this cold bitter sadness for 2 hours.  It was the worst I've felt in a long time.  
When anxious I have a really hard time making even simple decisions	I over think and worry about their ramifications	 <e1> When anxious I have a really hard time making even simple decisions </e1> , b/c  <e2> I over think and worry about their ramifications </e2> ; which in turn makes me more anxious.  Anyone else experience this, and have help tips on how to handle to situation? Thanks, loves.  &lt;3
Okay	presence.	Okay so someone might miss me, I don't think anyone should though.  No one knew how miserable and useless I was.  My parents have two other younger kids to look after, they'll be honestly happier without me (a failure and a burden in their family), my siblings will be happy as my sister will get all my clothes, gadgets and my brother will get my room, my friends- I honestly don't think I have any left cause I have been very distinct from everyone and everybody is anyways better off without me.  My teachers wouldn't care (I was the kid who troubles the teachers), my classmates will be happy cause idk but they will be.  lol I don't even know who all are connected with my physical presence. 
Long	true	Long story short the police in my town are complete terrors and this is widely known in my general area.  Ever since I was 13 (30 now) there have been countless threats of harm, assaults, false tickets and accusations, harassment, being followed and campaigned against, targeted ect.  I had night terrors every night all night long for years.  Was afraid to leave the house.  I'm always afraid that I'm going to get in trouble for no reason and always thinking I'm breaking laws.  I don't drive because that I where you are likely to encounter the police.  Sometimes even seeing one of my town's cop cars is enough to make me completely psychotic and delusional.  I'm often delusional and extremely preoccupied about it.  It runs a lot of my life.  Yes it's true
Today	you.	Today has been a overwelming spiral of nostalgia of my youth of before I ever picked up cigarettes.   Usually it's from smelling something, but today it was emotions, and more specifically cold weather.  And they were all wonderfull comforting feelings.  And of belonging.  What triggered it was an unusual cold front, ( despite it being 60 degrees ) mixed with not really experiencing an actual winter in years. I just wanted to share this with you to give you guys hope.  There is light on this side of the tunnel and we'll be waiting for you. 
I am excited	I can do with the extra cash, the reduction of calories and a summer free of drinking	This last month has been a bit of an eye opener to me about the things that I want out of life and the barriers that stand in my way.  First and foremost I want to be a healthier person that doesn't rely on substances to level out my mood.  Second, I want to save up for activities that make me feel good about myself and keep me active. Already I have seen the benefits of quitting smoking for my bank account, and my lungs.  I've restarted are running program and it gets better all the time.  However, alcohol remains one of the real expenses in my life that has also caused me to gain weight.  These days I feel like I can do anything and that I want nothing to stop me from progressing.  For this reason I will be dropping drinking as well.  I don't know how these next few days will be, maybe there will not be any noticeable change at all.  However,  <e1> I am excited </e1>  for what  <e2> I can do with the extra cash, the reduction of calories and a summer free of drinking </e2> .  Thanks everyone and best of luck today.  
It's	face.	It's between me staying home and crying or me going out in public and crying at this point.  It is nice to get out of the house but I don't want people to see me that weak.  I tried hanging out with friends but it's just uncomfortable and awkward for both of us. .  What's the matter with me? I feel like I'm not enjoying life to its fullest extent.  I don't know how to shake this feeling.  Sometimes I feel myself start to tear up during work or on lunch break.  It's really uncomfortable because I am constantly working with people face to face.  
I'm	time.	I'm Feeling pretty hopeless today.   I'm back to day 1 and I feel like I've been here thousands of times.    I can't seem to stay sober for longer than a week, at best.   Part of me thinks that I must not want sobriety enough if I cant manage to drag myself away from the bottle, but a more rational part of me knows that this is an addiction and I need help.    I'm sorry to be such a negative Nancy,  but this is becoming Groundhogs Day for me and I just want to scream.   Day 1 and 1 day at a time.  
I'm	exhausting.	I'm not sure if I am actually depressed.  I just feel very guilty about things. My heart feels like it's tired and just wants to shut down for a bit.  Feels weird and exhausting. 
Going to class, studying, working out and having somewhat of a social life	was a struggle for me	Wake up, go to the gym, go to class, go to sorority/frat event or chapter, go to club event, go to work, have dinner with a friend, go to sleep, repeat.  This is what I've observed people doing in college, and after graduation I am just now processing how much they did.  How does one do all this every day without falling apart eventually?  <e1> Going to class, studying, working out and having somewhat of a social life </e1>   <e2> was a struggle for me </e2>  in and of itself.  I feel like it just comes down to genetics, and those who cannot handle the workload (like myself) break and burn out.  
I am truly suffering	not sure what to do	So I'm seeing a doctor about my anxiety which has become crippling, this will be my 2nd visit to her.  I've been suffering a long time.  I was kind of opposed to medication for awhile but I think it is necessary now.  Is it appropriate to say to the doctor what I would like to do for treatment? Obviously she is the medical professional but I've researched what may work for me.  I just want to make sure I'm not overstepping any boundaries as I'm already afraid I'm wasting everyone's time.  For example I would sayI'd like to start with a low dose of medication like citalopram and take an anti-anxiety like diazepam or xanax in the short term while I wait to begin therapy next month. I just feel like she will think I'm medication seeking or something.  I've never taken anything like this but  <e1> I am truly suffering  </e1> so  <e2> not sure what to do </e2> .  Wondering if bringing it up like I've written above is wildly inappropriate.  Any advice? 
I think he's disappointed	my eyes are no longer red	My 5 y/o said that to me this morning. . .  To which I replied, what colour are my eyes usually??? Red! <e1> I think he's disappointed </e1>   <e2> my eyes are no longer red </e2>  but if he's noticed I can't imagine to think what was thought of my by my colleagues and peers. Feeling good. .  going stronger now
I	grateful.	I had a team event this weekend in a sport/league that always parties hard after the racing is done.  I was worried about it, being only a month or so into this next step in my progress.  But I'm proud to say, No problems, Not even a little.  And It's kind of fun being the DD (for once in my life) for my friends.           Thanks SD, I've come to rely on my morning check in and a little support from you fine people.  For me, It's all the difference in the world, And I'm truly grateful.  
I am ashamed	I took so much drugs	Hello. Its another sleepless night for me (4:16 am).  I think I might be suffering from DP/DR after a very, very bad trip on multiple drugs (with DMT as a leading role) on a psychedelic trance festival a week ago.  <e1> I am ashamed </e1>  that  <e2> I took so much drugs </e2>  but I lost controll over my behavior.  When Im getting high I just cant stop doing it. . . That day I took 500mg of MDMA, drunk prior to that 3L of beer, smoked a lot of marijuana, after the extasy started to come down I used amphetamine to stay awake and alert, someone gave me seeds of morning glory plant with LSA - I ate 7 pcs.  In the mean time we were inhaling some Nitrous Oxide with friends.  Some time later, a random person from the crowd came to me and gave me some DMT in an intent to enlighten me (show me higher state of being - as he said) - I accepted.  I smoked in total 3 times in a row (separated by mere minutes).  1st time was great (visuals and sounds etc. ) 2nd was superb - the feeling
Dreading having to get up and act like I'm a normal person	makes me stay up way longer then I should	I rarely dream when I sleep, so it's like I'm just being teleported to the beginning of the next day whenever I do fall asleep.   <e1> Dreading having to get up and act like I'm a normal person </e1>   <e2> makes me stay up way longer then I should </e2> .  Which puts me in a vicious cycle where I'm always tired and I don't really see an end to it.  
I've been feeling really down lately	when I consider my life	 <e1> I've been feeling really down lately </e1>   <e2> when I consider my life </e2> .  I know people say all the time that they're gonna die alone but in my case I think I actually will.  Ive never been on a date
It	insane?	It started off like nothing, but became obsessive.   Nearly every thought I have, I have to write down somewhere.   Why? I have no fucking clue.   I think I'm crazy.   I believe I'm afraid I'll never have the thought again.   I also write down things that happen in my life, and sometimes I'll write down the day and time.   Like, if I remember what drink I loved in Pre School (Sunny D), I will write it down.   Say I have a thought, and I go to write it down, and I forgot it, I will literally shut down, and try to remember it until I do.  I try to convince myself not to stress, because I'll have the thought or memory again, but I stress anyway.   I don't know what to do.   I literally have pages upon pages of notes or memories wrote down.  I need help to stop.   And I know it's me that should help myself, but I can't.   Why will I punish myself for forgetting a thought I had? Am I insane?  
as soon as they get to know me they run away	my depression makes me a boring and stupid person	I am fucking repulsive.  People start talking to me because they think i'm funny or something but  <e1> as soon as they get to know me they run away </e1>  because  <e2> my depression makes me a boring and stupid person </e2>  and I have nothing to say.  I'm sorry I got attached to you.  I'm sorry that I wanted friends.  I just want to feel like someone wants me.  If I'm not meant to be happy why can't I just fucking leave this place already? Who really would I hurt? The few people in my life would get over it eventually.  People only stick around because they feel bad for me.  I love being treated like a 5 year old.  Nobody respects me. Man I don't know how I'm gonna be able to work today. 
Hi,I'm	Thanks	Hi,I'm flying for a holiday tomorrow and I'm a bit worried about flying with my meds.  I'm currently on two antidepressants (paroxetine and mirtazapine) as well as an atypical antipsychotic (quentiapine) for anxiety/depression. I have read that just to be sure it's better when you have a confirmation from your doctor about taking meds.  I have also confirmed this with a relative who works for said company that it's better to have it.  Does anyone have experience with this and if yes what was included on the note from the Doctor?I'm flying with Wizz Air and the flight is within the EU. Thanks
So	him?	So i have a boyfried, and he is great. ( i dont live with him) The last few days I've felt really depressed and i dont know if i should tell him, or if i should try to hide it.  Im scared it will be too much for him, that i drag him down with me.  I Have concluded that I'm going to just pull away until i feel better again.  So i wonder if thats a good idea, or if i should tell him? 
I originally applied to study abroad	at that time I thought I had overcome the anxiety and problems which had prevented me from having a good time at university	i have an offer to study abroad next year for a semester.  This year I started university in a foreign country and struggled with high social anxiety and bouts of depression throughout the year.   <e1> I originally applied to study abroad </e1>  because  <e2> at that time I thought I had overcome the anxiety and problems which had prevented me from having a good time at university </e2> .  I also want to experience a new country and attending this university as part of study abroad would really help my cv.  However, I am no longer sure whether going abroad would be a good idea.  I am worried that if I start again with the anxiety and bad thoughts I might make it a negative experience and also make my presence unpleasant for other fellow students studying abroad. I would really appreciate your opinion and would like to know if anyone has had the same issues and whether they did end up going abroad and what was their expereince. 
I've	out?	I've just gone through someone important to me basically breaking me open.  And I'm trying my best to recover.  And I'll mostly feel fine.  Usually when I'm out with friends or just out of the house.  But I keep running into these moments where I'll think back to it and suddenly everything is dreadful.  Life feels dark.  I feel like I'll never be happy again (Even tho it keeps happening).  And inside my head I decide that i'm going to end it.  And I've come close.  But then it'll go away.  And I'll feel fine again, and go like wow wtf dude chill.  And then it'll come back.  And it's like an emotional roller coaster and it's fucking with my head.  I really can't stand life rn.  Has anyone experienced something like this? How do you work it out?
It	all.	It is my understanding that red vein strains tend to be the strongest and carry the most opiate like effects.  I have been tapering for a few weeks and have gotten down to 3 grams a day (still trying to get comfortable with that) of red md.  My question is. . . if I switched to a green vein and could hold at the 3 grams and then maybe even switched to a white vein (which I never really liked) at the tail end would that help aide my body getting use to no alkaloids at all.  
I	games	I have been playing for my whole life and I truly do enjoy them, but in recent years they have started to control aspect of my life that they shouldn't.  It was okay when I was younger but I am in college and working on a degrees and art.  Art requires a hell of amount of out of school outside personal effort to get to places you want to be.  I get home from work each day and get on discord to chat up and chill with my friends but, I will sit there and relax and eventually they start complaining they are bored and I'll play a game thinking It will only be a couple hours and tell them I need to work on art later on.  I tell them every day.  I believe they are also addicted to games
It's	should?	It's finally summer and I'm going to the beach, having quality time with friends, and doing activities that I like.  Instead of getting excited I just start thinking that school and winter is getting closer.  Is anyone else having a hard time enjoying stuff they should?
So glad	I've got through the worst and coming out the other side	 <e1> So glad </e1>   <e2> I've got through the worst and coming out the other side </e2> .  Had a crap time at the beginning feeling poorly tired and drained.  Had some bad craving hours  not minutes lol but I feel proud I didn't cave in to any of that because now I hardly think about them! I know this time I won't go back just have to get through it if and when it rears its ugly head.  I will be ready.  Keep at it peeps not one puff !! 
I	with.	I got a hold of my old friend and we played ps4 online, but he doesn't want to hangout.  He just keeps making excuses.  I guess no one want to be around a depressed person who drinks a lot.  I just wish I had one person to hangout with.  
I	is.	I know the title says intrusive thoughts but I'm trying to cover a little more.  Do you ever just have thoughts in general and feel super guilty about them ? Like maybe after you have them you need to tell your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone or you'll just be overcome with guilt all the time ? Well I know I do.  But let's look at the word thought.  A thought is a thought not an action.  Shouldn't we have the right to our own thoughts anyways without having to feel guilty for them ? Just something I was thinking about.  I have been battling ocd for a long time and I know what the hunger for closure is.  
I	support.	I am stressed I won't be able to find a new place to live by the time I have to move out in late July or early August.  I looked at a place today and the manager said they didn't think I would be approved for it because my monthly income is just a little less than the rent. So I revised my search but I am still afraid my temp work won't be good enough or my income won't be enough to secure a place, even though I have plenty of savings.  I was thinking about emailing a few people I know in the area, to ask them for help or ideas on finding a place, but I have NO idea what to say and could use help with what to say to them. I am feeling pretty frustrated and I could use some support. 
I've	day	I've tried NA and AA.  I was in service, I prayed, had a sponsor, took the steps, all while in meetings that were mostly unwelcoming and cold (I made 200ish meetings  just in my first 90 days, of them only 10 were ones I really enjoyed and those were the ones I went to the rest of the time I stayed in 12 step groups).  I was the alternate rep for my home group, I even chaired and spoke at meetings.  But I never had the spiritual experience, no amount of prayer made the cravings or obsession go away.  Nothing happened.     I white-knuckled after I finally left.  I did intensive outpatient last year, for dual-diagnosis patients.  I'm not really sure how they measure success, though.  Medication management for my schizo and my panic disorder was the only helpful thing I got out of it.  None of the meditation stuff they taught helped with my symptoms.  But despite not getting anything out of the actual group therapy, and never getting any one-on-one therapy, they said that I succeeded and was doing great and they released me after two months in the program.  (To this day
I've	has.	I've recently been suffering from depression and anxiety and it had started to take over my life.  then about a week ago I went on a backpacking campout.  It was nice to have fresh air and be away from technology for a while, but when I came back, I suddenly found myself feeling happy and motivated.  I didn't feel perfect, but my depression was significantly reduced.  it's been a week since then and I feel my depression creeping up again, but still it helped a lot for a while.  Has this happened to anybody else? i've tried everything to fight my depression without having to tell anyone about it.  but something about going on a campout and getting fresh air helped more than anything else has. 
Hi	of?	Hi everyone! I'm taking a summer art class and my final installation piece is going to be about what it's like to have schizophrenia.  I'm so excited to get to share this personal information in a medium that's always helped me cope! Does anyone have a favorite schizophrenic artist or possible motif they know of?
So	Redditors.	So I am nervous and about to start a really big change in my life.  I am going to quit smoking, cold turkey.  I just smoked my very last cigarette.  I have attempted this in the past but never a seriously as I should have.  Today is the day but I know the time ahead of me is going to be rough and I have come here to learn from your experiences and maybe even for a bit of encouragement.  Although I know there are going to be some difficult times but the benefits will out way that, this is the first step to a new healthy life change.  I have to remember the best things in life are on the other side of fear.  Wish me luck fellow Redditors.  
I got all my stuff back	now I'm happily	Hey guys, it's been quite a while.  I haven't been able to settle down and write until recently.  A lot has happened since I last posted, and a lot of it only happened because you guys pushed me in the right direction.  TL;DR: I was attacked by Nmother, she held my stuff hostage, I got a paralegal, he was amazing,  <e1> I got all my stuff back </e1> ,  <e2> now I'm happily </e2>  NC.  Story since I last posted: I frantically called up a bunch of lawyers and paralegals when you guys suggested I go the actual legal route.  A bunch of lawyers told me they wanted over $ 2k to write a letter of demand, one paralegal laughed at me over the phone (until I told him o
I	knows	I mean sorry for being angry about this, but COME ON ALREADY, Reddit, I just tried to post a 7753 (including spaces) greeting to the group and a statement of my problem, somethng which I find it essential to do.  I've seen much longer posts even here, so it can't be message length.  Yet for whatever reaosn, and time and time again, and without regard to the size of posts I'm trying to make, half of them only make the here was a problem box pop up.  So just what the HELL IS THIS PROBLEM???!!!  If anyone knows
I	is.	I was supposed to have a prescription delivered to the pharmacy by post but it didnt arrive.  I start my first job in two years and first since the diagnosis - I was already panicked but having a day without meds has gotten me in a right state. I really dont know how to cope with a new environment anyway so its even worse without meds.   I just wanted to share my feelings with you guys as most dont understand how scary this is. 
I've	:-)	I've just relapsed.  Twice within the same 30 minutes.  Goddamnit.  In retrospect I'm not really surprised.  I had a job interview Monday and I've begun to change a lot of things in my life.  I've begun a steady process to write on and actually try to finish my first novel.  So I have a lot to deal with, but I refuse for my addiction to rule my actions and my life.  Simple as that.  I'll be checking into this fine subreddit on a regular basis as well as r/nofap.  Thanks in advance! :-)
Divine	Meditation!	Divine intervention.   Wednesday is the only day I actually have to go into work.   I basically work for myself but as part of a group and we meet every Wednesday.   I was still wimping out on going and the one friend who knows what I'm going through called at 11:45.   I told her I was wimpimg out and she wouldn't even stay on the phone. . just said get up now and go.   so i did.   and of course it was SO the right thing to do.   I love these people and I was welcomed back with open arms.   It was so good to be back without that dreaded horribleness coursing through me. FYI, I thought it was kratom that made me so talkative. . . but alas. . . I think that is the real me.  At Least it wasn't too obvious to anyone that there is a new me as she still resembles the k me.   Also, as shown by my activity on this sub.   Too bad.   I would really like to be somewhat quieter.   Next on my list of good things to do for myself: Meditation!
I	2017	I have been trying to hash out a quit date for a few weeks now.  After work in the shower I had the thought why not now? I'm cleansing my tired sore hot body why quit there? 2 years ago I quit using heroin dammit I can quit smoking my last and greatest vice as well.  Whilst mass unsubbing down the list I happened to glance towards the existance of this subreddit and seems like the pieces are falling into  place.  Quit date: Wednesday June 14th 18:00 2017
I	with!	I always forget to respond to friend's text messages and even my girlfriend's.  After I read them too!  I have definitely upset some people, and I feel like I'm not giving my girlfriend the right amount of attention.  It's like I get distracted thinking about what I'm going to reply with!  
(last	longer	(last few paragraphs has the main point, but this is most of the recent story, but I would appreciate if you took the time to read at least the first half) I have been depressed for a very long time. . . . . .  probably since 7th grade, and I have had feelings of saying I hate myself for even longer
I	forward.	I ripped the mother fucker out.  I detached from the gaming addiction. . I don't even think I can put a card in.  A video card attached to gaming aspect for those that don't know.  I handed it to my sister.  I am done with this aspect of my life.  I'm ready to be sober for good.  I will find meetings.  I will find other people sober to engage with.   My mind keeps telling me to wake up and get on the PC.  It's such a relief to know it's over. I am so=y to all I've kept letting down.  I promise this is over.  There's no going back and I will be letting this part of my life go.  Obviously my drinking end binging was severely attached to binge drinking.  I lay here writing this still sobering up.  I went and bought more. I'm fucking done. Cheers to everyone who has remaind sober. You deserve it I apologise for my rantTravis is out.  Sober going forward. 
I've	you	I've been struggling with self-confidence for a while now but no matter how much I put I can never achieve it.  I just don't want to do this anymore, I hate it and I hate myself.  I'm just not good enough for this.  Yesterday was okay the day before that I was fine, stressed but fine.  I've been in a relationship for almost a year and I'm still a shit gf.  I cant believe him when he says that I make him happy or cheer him up because all I ever remember doing is just pissing him off.  Sometimes I don't even believe him when he says I love you 
I have trouble focusing	people are talking around me	I was thinking about this as I was working today.  Is there a scientific reason why playing certain sounds help me focus, while others don't? Like why does certain instrumental music or ASMR help me focus significantly, but non-instrumental music distracts me?  <e1> I have trouble focusing </e1>  when  <e2> people are talking around me </e2> , but total silence also makes it difficult to focus after a while.  There's like this arbitrary, optimal level of ambient noise that I like to work in.  I've heard of things like ASMR videos really helping other ADHD people too.  Is it the sensory aspect? Has anyone ever done studies on this?
So	Thanks.	So I've been taking Zoloft for several months and it has been working well for anxiety/depression but I'm having some problems with it.   The biggest problem is that my mind feels blank a majority of the time.   When conversing with other people sometimes I feel as if I have nothing to say.   I feel as if I am less witty, and also less creative.   I've backed down my dosage from 100mg to 50mg with some success as I don't feel as 'spaced out'.   I am now backing down to 25mg to see if I feel any better.   I guess I'm posting here to see if anyone else has had similiar problems and if so what have you done.   Zoloft works great for anxiety (panic attacks, general feeling of dread), and also works well for depression, but I feel like I've lost some of my personality, my creativity, and wit. Any responses/feedback are awesome! Thanks. 
I feel intense guilt and shame	my attitude and assholeyness	Hey allI used to be a person with so much patience that I was practically a doormat, but for the past few months that seems to have changed.  Idk why.  I'm not on medications and I don't drink.  I do smoke weed and eat like shit but I've been doing that for years.  Has anyone else experienced this? I've been snapping at my friends and family.  I have serious road rage.  I have zero patience for strangers trying to strike up conversation or people on the street trying to get you to look at their clipboards.  I get angry and give up the second something is difficult.  I've been bitching people out left and right for things that are definitely annoying, but not something to be sassy to them about. Almost immediately,  <e1> I feel intense guilt and shame </e1>  for  <e2> my attitude and assholeyness </e2> .  I know it's wrong, but I've never been this way before and I don't know how to deal with it.  I just have so much anger all of a sudden.  
How	Example	How many of your narcs lost their ever loving shit? Or did you have one of those pervs who used he talk to abuse you? I'm curious because I've read a lot of similar stories.  Example
Tomorrow	:/	Tomorrow marks the second year since I was taken advantage of by someone I saw as a father figure.  The seventeenth is the sixth year anniversary since my dad passed away suddenly. Then Father's day is Sunday.  I've just been in a auto pilot depressed zombie mode since Monday.  :/
if this lasted forever	I'd be happy forever	I'm 20, I go to university (UK), I accidentally fell for my housemate this year (not living with them next year) and right now they've been acting distant and, essentially, not giving me much attention.  Coming from several straight months of hanging with them, chilling with them, thinking Well  <e1> if this lasted forever </e1>  then  <e2> I'd be happy forever </e2>  and doing loads of stuff
I have been happy with adderall IR	I can feel my tolerance going up and up and the constant up and down feels strange	So I am currently taking adderall 10mg 2x a day.  My tolerance has definitely increased from taking it everyday with no breaks.  I just started a full-time job.  I have tried vyvanse and did not like it at all.  I only gave it a week but the comedown made me feel strange.  I heard that vyvanse is like the king of XR ADD medication. My psych has insisted for a while that I switch to XR version of medication since I need it to work all day now but  <e1> I have been happy with adderall IR </e1> .   <e2> I can feel my tolerance going up and up and the constant up and down feels strange </e2> . Anyone else went from IR to XR with good results?What was your original IR medication and dosage and your new XR medication and dosage?I am going to use this post as a good starting point with my psych in my appointment next week.  
The last thing I want is to have my feelings ignored	someone else is afraid	I'm tired of fighting to get by.  I'm tired of living in a world that hates me (I'm trans).  I'm tired of dealing with other people's bullshit. I'm tired of being strong.  I'm tired of acting like I'm okay.  I'm tired of keeping everything inside, because sharing just results in people trying to change my feelings.  I don't have the energy for that.   <e1> The last thing I want is to have my feelings ignored </e1>  because  <e2> someone else is afraid </e2> .  You're worried about how much it will hurt to lose me? What about how much it hurts me to stay here? I don't want to live.  It's not worth it.  Sure, maybe stuff will get a little better.  But, it's not going to cancel all the shit.  It's not going to stop the murder of queer people.  It's not going to stop the fascism rising up around me.  It's not going to fix anything. I think. . .  I just need to vent to people who can understand these feelings, instead of rying to make things better.  The fish are dead
I'm constantly panicking	about my parents talking about me	 <e1> I'm constantly panicking </e1>   <e2> about my parents talking about me </e2> .  Every time I hear a sound from downstairs, or they're alone together or out to dinner, or they're on the phone, I assume it's about me and they're going to call me into the living room and tell me to sit down and confront me with something awful. I think it stems from when my mom found an empty vodka bottle in my room and ambushed me about it, thinking I had a drinking problem.  I'm not an alcoholic (I had forgotten about the bottle, it was from ages ago) and I immediately fell into a panic attack, crying hysterically and muttering It's not true
I	mark!!!!	I am so excited to have hit the 5 day mark!!!! 
when	:/	when I saw I had a notification I felt guilty that I hadn't been there to answer the one time someone wanted to call me, and then i opened it, saw that no one had actually tried to call me, and now I'm even lonelier.  i had been feeling better the past few days and this ruined it.  honestly, how do fake notifications happen? i don't understand how it's even possible :/
408	today.	408 days ago if I was going on this trip Mexico my vacation would be filled with brutal hangovers and black out nights.  Not this time!!!This time I will enjoy every second of my vacation being sober.  In airport now and zero trigger.  You all were right when you said gets easier.  I'm so glad I decided not to drink today.    
I	good	I am 21 years old and I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (or rather, C-PTSD).  I have finally decided to try to make an attempt at recovery from my abuse that I have experienced throughout my life.  I don't know how to identify my emotions.  I don't know my triggers.  I don't even actually know when something's wrong or not.  I'm always numb, yet extremely anxious(?) or just overwhelmed with what I'm guessing might be guilt or shame.  I was sexually assaulted by my brother as a child, somewhere between the ages of 6-9 countless times.  He was around 12-15.  He would make me masturbate for him.  He would coerce me into going down on him, even though it was barely possible since I was so young.  I have this feeling inside of me that he raped me, too, but I don't have an actual memory of it.  He would have me take my pants off and he would do the same and he would grind on me, saying things like: Don't you like that? It feels good
First	morning.	First of all i am so sorry my bad english.  I am an idiot who cant learn english but i must write this post.  I dont have anything in this life.  I wake up with suicide thought every fucking single day. I am 17 years old.  I have suicidal thought for 3 years.  Two times i attempted but i dont have courage to die.  I am loser.  I am not clever enough for living.  I am very ugly.  I am fat .  I have small penis.  I have no chance about girls.  I am unsuccesful in everything.  I have diabetes.  I have keratosis pilaris.  I fucking hate myself. I wish i have courage for suicide.  Everytime before i sleep i want to be died morning. 
it's easier for me	I'm more detached from myself	 <e1> it's easier for me </e1>  since  <e2> I'm more detached from myself </e2> , for like 5 brief seconds I can go back to a more normal state in which I'm more aware of the envoriement and my body which is really bad for the social anxiety
I	medication?	I started a 30mg Vyvanse dose everyday, and it started to work finally.  I am getting so much stuff done, never procrastinating.  The Vyvanse lasts me a full 12 hours which I am very happy for; however, I have zero appetite and eating just feels like I could rather be doing something productive.  I know it sounds silly, but this is literally how my mind feels. What I guess I am asking is, how do you guys manage to eat while on medication? 
I get so bitter, jealous and depressed	when Fathers day comes around	 <e1> I get so bitter, jealous and depressed </e1>   <e2> when Fathers day comes around </e2> .  I wish I had a dad who made me feel wanted, who gave me anything out of the selfishness of their heart, or a dad who taught me more than how to mistrust. . .   I don't want things.  I just wanted a dad who gave a hit that I was born. . . My dad was a narcisist.  He's been dead for two years and it sucks that I'm still mentally and emotionally fighting all of the psychological abuse that lasted beyond the grave. . .  
Is	this?	Is it normal to feel anxious even when you're around family members/people you know sorta well? I visited family in another state recently.  I didn't grow up with them but I've spent some time with them before.  They are really nice to me.  I appreciate them.  However, each time I'm with them, I can't seem to hold a conversation, much less start one.  Besides not growing up together,   my mind starts thinking of all our different views in religion, marriage, etc.  I think I am putting up excuses to not socialize. . . idk.  Does anyone experience something like this? 
My	words.	My brother is definitely the golden child in our family, and also the oldest and most troubled of us. He is idealized by our mother to an insane, delusional level.  She makes all kind of bullshit excuses for his behavior and actions.  He's almost 40, and she still talks to him like he's a child.  Meanwhile, here he is doing drugs and selling on the streets, and she denies it all or says we (me and the rest of my siblings) are jealous of him. She once said he reminded her of Jesus, and that she had vivid dreams that she (nmom) and him were Mary and Jesus reincarnated.  She insists he's going to become a preacher someday and maybe even a leader. I have no words. 
I	sucking.	I am thinking its seriously going to happen this time.  It has been a little over a year since i have quit chewing.  Not sure how many of you are familiar with the army but i get to spend this fine 1st week anniversary while on a 24 hour CQ shift! so. . .  proud to say that I am sucking with out sucking. 
i	.	i know this is a harsh decision, but i dont see any other solution.  Shrinks wont help me be attractive and find someone.  Im doomed and trapped with this face and body.  It just sucks seeing others happy and together and me this ugly wreck of a man. . . . 
anyone	them?	anyone else think their voice(s) are coming from a person they know in real life? do you talk to them? ignore them? afraid of them? 
My	well!	My 20 something kids just told me that Lucille (the mom on Arrested Development reminds them of Grandma(my Nmom).  I watched a bit of that show on Netflix and I concurred!  So sad to know that Nmom has ruined her relationship with them as well!
Hi,	attention	Hi, I don't want to seem like a hypochondriac, but lately I've been sort of worried I'm hallucinating. I read the post stickied to the top of the sub with information for people who think they may be developing schizophrenia, but I still wanted to make a post so I could talk to somebody.  I was recently diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and I wanted to talk to somebody anonymous with some experience in the subject before I talk to family members and make them more worried. It's become more apparent since realizing I have an anxiety problem, but sometimes when I'm in public I'll think people near me are talking about me.  If you've ever been in a crowded room and somebody said shit and it sort of drew your attention
I'm going back to therapy to try to deal with this	my anxiety is also affecting other parts of my life as well	I am a nurse and I have to do several call shifts a month.  My anxiety is terrible when I'm on call.  It's unbearable.  I can't stop staring at my phone, I don't sleep, and my heart won't stop racing.  I keep randomly crying.  I hate feeling like this. I wish I could just be that person that is laid back and go wherever the wind blows, but that will never be me.   <e1> I'm going back to therapy to try to deal with this </e1> , as  <e2> my anxiety is also affecting other parts of my life as well </e2> .  But mostly, it makes me miserable at doing my job, which I think I am fairly decent at. Does anyone have any advice? I've been a nurse for almost 7 years and I don't know what else I would do or where I would even go from here. 
I just wrote so many paragraphs, but deleted them	it was just unnecessary words	 <e1> I just wrote so many paragraphs, but deleted them </e1>  because  <e2> it was just unnecessary words </e2> . Basically, I've felt like shit for the past two years, but lately I've felt a lot less shitty. Couldn't really tell you why, it's probably a combination of the pills they're shoving down my throat, better circumstances, and the occasional break in the monotony.  Point is, don't lose hope.  Life is pretty shitty from an objective point of view.  But it's just up and down really.  Don't forget about the up part of it.  Hope you're all doing well
I love not smoking	I hated myself *for* smoking	 <e1> I love not smoking </e1> as much as  <e2> I hated myself *for* smoking </e2> .  It is so nice to not sneak off, hide or buy another pack all the while knowing better.  Of course, I wish I had learned this sooner but man, am I glad I did not wait another day (which would have meant another year or even decade). Carpe Diem! 
I always felt disconnected from myself and reality	which caused me to be in a sad, low mood	I was alway quite lonely as a child.  A few years back, I had little social life, and would spend most days playing video games in my room for hours.   <e1> I always felt disconnected from myself and reality </e1> ,  <e2> which caused me to be in a sad, low mood </e2> .  Now, things are looking up, and while I still feel a bit disconnected at times, I am mostly doing well, especially when I am in good moods. 
Not	time	Not sure if anyone remembers me but I've been in this sub for a while.  I found the trigger to my relapses.  Sadly. . . it was my girlfriend.  God bless her.  She just couldn't understand what I was going through and would personalize my withdrawals.  No matter how many times I tried to explain what I was going through.  She would make me feel so bad for being depressed or anxious or not having any energy to go out and be active (she is a very active person).  After relapsing yet again, I knew what I had to do.  I told her that I had to do this without her.  As most of you know, kratom WDs require an insane amount of focus and selfishness to fight through it.  I simply had nothing left over for her at the end of the day of fighting.  To make her happy, I would relapse and become fun guy that she would love.  This time was different.  I told her I had no expectations of what she should do in the mean time
Hi	it?	Hi all, been feeling suicidal and destructive lately.  Having difficulty getting to work on time.  Cutting off relationships and fighting with the one good friend I have right now.  Issue is that I have no insurance and I don't have any wealthy friends or family who can help me attend a private facility, so my only option is state care.  I've read poor reviews about these places (all state hospitals in my area have 1. 8 stars) whereas the private joint has 4. 5 stars.  I don't want to be on 15 different medications.  And I have inflammatory issues that make my diet very specific.   Is it still worth it?
I	too.	I pray ever night to not wake up.  Every second I'm awake is painful, I have not been happy since last year.  Every single thing that gave me hope and happiness is gone.  It's only a matter of time before I can't take and anymore and run away or kill myself.  I'm sick of crying, of headaches, of that sinking feeling in my gut, of being ignored, of being ugly and inferior. . I'm so sick of my entire life.  I am inferior to every single person, I'm nothing.  And the people I cared about most have done nothing but reinforce that.  I used to stay alive thinking I could never leave my cat but I know she'll be fine and taken care of.  I volunteer with animals but I know they'll be cared for too.  
When I look back, he had ODD, although this has reduced sharply	I did my best to be non reactive and super loving	**Backstory:** My son is 14. 5yo.  For the longest time from around 7yo, despite our efforts meeting with various psychologists and therapists, his real issues went undiagnosed.  We were told he was profoundly gifted but had central auditory processing disorder and visual processing disorder.  Years of therapy didn't help.   <e1> When I look back, he had ODD, although this has reduced sharply </e1>  as  <e2> I did my best to be non reactive and super loving </e2> .  He's been violent several times, but it's definitely subsiding/ed.   &amp;nbsp;Last year, he started school (we homeschooled), and it was through his teachers that we realised he has ADHD.  We just started medication several days ago, and he's amazed by the difference - he can slow down his reading to understand complicated text and carry on complex conversation.  He's in the process of titration at the moment, and it's way more good than bad.  &amp;nbsp;My question is, are there people out there who, with the help of meds, have achieved their potential? My son is in a highly competitive
I	long.	I just feel like I'm not here.  I don't feel right.  I have no thoughts in my head.  Just numbness.  I feel comfortable in this numb place.  It just surrounds me like a warm familiar hug.  People come and go, but the feelings stay the same.  I always let people down so I don't feel like trying anymore.  Sometimes I think I like being miserable.  Go through the motions, day in and day out.  Watch the people around me living such normal lives.  How did I get here? Why can't I go anywhere else? What should I do with all this time I have on my hands? A day without anxiety would be nice.  One without depression even better.  I hate knowing that I have to live with this the rest of my life and there's no way to change me.  I'm 22 years old and I feel like I've been ruined for the rest of my life.  Empty thoughts.  Fake smiles.  Looking at your feet while you walk, to make sure that nobody notices you.  Being that fly on the wall.  There's something I envy about a house fly.  Their lives are only about 28 days long.  
Even more embarrassing	they'll notice at work and I'm afraid I'll offend my nail tech	But it's thrown me into an anxiety attack.  One that's lasted throughout the night and into my dreams (example: dreamt my SO was cheating on me, and that I was pooping out silver fish. .  wth?)Anyway I got my nails done yesterday and got a style I've been wanting do try.  Stiletto nails.  But now I'm worried I'm gonna go into work tomorrow and everyone will hate them/ say how ridiculous they are and inappropriate (I'm a vet tech) I don't know why I care - *i* love them.  I'm just afraid I'll be embarrassed and then regret spending money on them which will send me into another anxiety spiral.  And then if I have to have them changed?  <e1> Even more embarrassing </e1>  because  <e2> they'll notice at work and I'm afraid I'll offend my nail tech </e2> .  Sigh.  If I knew how to attach a picture Id show them.  
Day	withdrawal.	Day 1 again.  I know the next 4 days are gonna suck, but i can get through them.  I feel like the real challenge is after I stop feeling bad.  I need to hold onto my sobriety and not substitute my kratom use with something else.  I feel hopeful guys, this will be the last time I go through withdrawal.  
I	friend.	I know I shouldn't feel this way but I do.   This weekend has been tough.   I feel like my best friend has died.   I don't want to do anything.   Just lay here thinking about my friend.   I keep telling myself my friend has died and is not coming back.   But it's truly hard.   I miss the taste.   I've been going to sleep extra early to get my friend out of my mind only to wake up super early rolling over wishing u could reach for my 'friend.   I truly feel a little lost.   I'm bored out of my mind but wish I could see my friend so I can get some encouragement to do something.   I don't want to turn to one of my other friends to make me happy.   I just don't feel good right now and needed to get this out.    I will continue to drive myself insane by repeating over and over again I will not drink with you today friend. 
I am having a hard time shaking the dark feelings I've had since that night	feeling really uneasy about the situation that has caused these feelings to begin with	The last few weeks I have been waking up with hangover symptoms, no alcohol involved. Mild headache, loss of appetite, mild nausea, loss of energy/weakness, and anxiety immediately upon waking.  It's the result of ongoing emotional pain, for which I don't have an outlet (I also have BPD and I'm trying hard not to be destructive).  Last night at work I began feeling very tired and upset for no specific reason.  I had to cancel plans with friends and, even though I'm glad I stayed home, I woke up feeling like I'd gone out and done horrible things.  I had a horrible experience earlier this week that landed me in a crisis center (was eventually sent home because there were no beds, was berated and left on the street at 6am, no sleep).   <e1> I am having a hard time shaking the dark feelings I've had since that night </e1> , and  <e2> feeling really uneasy about the situation that has caused these feelings to begin with </e2> .  I just want to feel strong and normal.  It feels like everything in my life is a process, but never meets an end. 
Today I don't plan on using anything either, especially benzos	I treat them with great respect	This has been easier than previous attempts so far, and I am very grateful for that.  I just woke up, and I am definitely achey, but for day 3 of wd I am in pretty good shape.  I feel exactly like I would feel pre-dose on any other morning I was actively using the plant.  Yesterday I just used a few immodium tablets to help with the restless legs and no benzos.   <e1> Today I don't plan on using anything either, especially benzos </e1>  since  <e2> I treat them with great respect </e2> .  Not looking forward to work tomorrow, but I must go.  I wish I could lay around in bed for another day.  Although maybe getting out of my bed and moving around will be better for me.  Going to call my father soon and wish him a happy father's day, and then take care of some homework I have been putting off for the kick.  Just wanted to update
So	future!	So 14 days and 18 hours ago I had my last cigarette.  Before then I gradually cut down over the course of a week before stopping.  I've been using a vape for the times ive been craving and I've been great.  Here's to the future! 
I told my mom I was pregnant last in our families	we knew the response would not be good	Background info - 20 years old, been with BF(22) for 3 years, unplanned pregnancy.  I'm still baffled by narcissistic behavior and trying to navigate all of it. Bf &amp;  <e1> I told my mom I was pregnant last in our families </e1>  bc  <e2> we knew the response would not be good </e2> .  Everyone else is ecstatic and very supportive, despite our age &amp; not being married.  She seemed in disbelief at first but put on this fake smile for BF and congratulated us but said no more.  She hasn't spoken to me about my pregnancy since (2 months) except to tell me about how she had a miscarriage. Recently
Broke	more.	Broke my streak of 3 months last night, thought it would be sweet to smoke weed after drinking for my 21st birthday.  Boy was that A BIG MISTAKE.  My self consciousness and paranoia hit me like no tommorow, I practically became a zombie.  I wasn't socialising with anyone, my brain felt fried.  I was stuck in my own thoughts, unable to escape them, even unable to string a sentence together.  My low vibe was sensed by everyone, questioning themselves what was wrong with me.  Boys and girls, no matter how long you have been off this substance, the feeling of smoking even just A LITTLE can get the worst of you, even when you least suspect it.  So remind yourself the next time you think of relapsing, ask yourself do I really want to feel like shit for the next couples of hours and regret it for the time being high? Hell fucking no.  This relapse was a big lesson and a wake up call.  Marijuana you are out of my life now, I don't need you no more.  
Mostly	first	Mostly a crosspost from getdiscliplined, was recommended here!Back in High School I had my close group of friends and many acquaintances, I worked out as well, and was overall happy with life.  That was 2005~2009. Fast forward to now, Im 26, I barely leave the house, my friends have all moved away, and I'm still finishing up school, getting B's and C's when i could be getting straight A's but I focus more on games, watching twitch. tv and just going on the internet.  My priorities for happiness are games first
Well,	wow	Well, it's Father's Day.  I didn't think today would trigger me, but something in my head just kept bringing myself back to all the bullshit that I have with my dad. We haven't talked in about a year.  It's a really long story--but, basically he's been emotionally abusive my whole life.  After him and I almost got physical (he got in my face) he kicked me out.  My mom and him divorced shortly after, and I haven't talked to him since.  It's been a really hard year.  I went through some really low points, and have struggled with feeling empty and shitty a lot in this past year.  It's been really bad, but it's been better lately.  I have moments where I think wow
I'm afraid to ween off of it and try a new one though	I don't want my depression to worsen	I've only ever tried one antidepressant, and it seemed to work really well for awhile.  But these past few weeks I haven't been feeling my best, and I'm afraid the medicine isn't doing it for me anymore.   <e1> I'm afraid to ween off of it and try a new one though </e1> , because  <e2> I don't want my depression to worsen </e2> .  Any advice? 
For	situation?	For the past few nights I've been feeling very anxious imagining that someone will break down my door and rape me (I've been raped in the past).  I recently came out to a large group of people for the first time.  I know that at least one person in that group is very homophobic, and I keep imagining that he or someone else will rape me out of hate.  I know that this is not likely, and I'm not really in a lot of danger, but my anxiety won't listen.  I was doing well for a while and not feeling so scared about rape before I came out.  I don't know what to do now to feel safe.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation? 
The	friends?	The fact that he and I would break up was inevitable; but when it happened, I went numb.  I attempted to vent into our group chat and then the fury inside of me awoke.  Do any of you guys go from furious to self loathing to thinking everyone is below you in a sort of cycle? That happened to me; I insulted him, along with two of our mutual friends, calling out their insecurities and even talking rudely about those they care about.  The thing is, it felt really good at the time and I felt that they were deserving and so obviously beneath me.  Does that happen to anyone else?Anyways, long story short, the group chat broke up, with my friends clearly stating that I'm a shallow and manipulative piece of shit.  So now I'm slightly numb, exhausted as usual, and really confused at my own mental state of being.  Can anyone give me advice on things to do now that I have no friends?
Im	me.	Im super fucking down rn.  Please tell me something to enlighten me. 
They become the expert	they know they can use my nervousness against me	Everyone talks down to me.  I'm a nervous guy and this makes it hard for me to open up and make friends.  I guess it's my fault for hanging around people I can't open up to. . .  still there are so many people who hear me say or do something and then immediately they act like they know my whole life story.   <e1> They become the expert </e1>  because  <e2> they know they can use my nervousness against me </e2> .  I can't even blame them, I shouldn't be so insecure i guesss.  I don't know why I even wrote this I don't deserve to be happy.  All I ever did was avoid relationships and jerk off in my free time.  
I'm	thoughts?	I'm going to start this off by saying I'm incredibly paranoid.  I am a dental assistant and on Friday I pressed the pad of my index finger and I felt a pain as if there was a splinter in my finger or if I had pricked it with something.  There is a circular  purple mark on my finger and it wasn't sore to press it after a while of me first discovering it.  I have gone over everything in my head and I can say for definite that I didn't prick myself with a needle.  I am almost certain that I didn't injure myself with a sharp instrument but my paranoia takes over and I can't help but doubt myself.   I am so scared that I have gotten a needlestick/sharps injury without me realising it.  What can I do to stop these thoughts?
i know my brain recognizes that i'm doing this for attention	i never had comfort in my life	I feel like no one cares.  i know people don't know how to properly word things to someone who is suicidal or they'll feel scared.  and  <e1> i know my brain recognizes that i'm doing this for attention </e1> , because  <e2> i never had comfort in my life </e2> .  my parents are toxic and have abused me my whole life.  i never had a bond with anyone growing up.  but i still continue to do this shit.  it's embarrassing.  i wish i could stop writing tweets.  
I	sale	I don't know where else to put this, not wanting upvotes, just needing someone to talk toI'm gonna start from most recent and work my way back.  I was getting lunch, was heading for work and leaving the taco place, I was watching left and turning right.  I should've been watching right anyways because these idiots started crossing the middle of this four lane road, not including the turning lane in the middle.  I knocked them down with my truck, they got up, screamed at me and walked away but I'm still freaking out because I almost ran over some people.  I went to get lunch in the first place to calm down because this guy who's been bullying me since he's started here, we'll call him Johnathon, just tried to steal another potential customer from me(I sell cars, I'm new to it, he's been doing it for years, and we share an office) I got onto him for it but he just started being a dick about it again like well I'd make a sale
I've	it.	I've suffered from social anxiety for years but recently it's just getting worse.  I avoid every social event either work or family related and feel like people must think I don't care at all but I do I want to go and have friends and do normal things but leading up to anything I get this worried feeling which makes me feel so sick and I overthink everything before anything even happens.  I've started talking to this girl from work online and she says I can take her out if I want, I've told her we should do it but I know if I say a day ill end up cancelling and come across as a twat or if I actually do go for it I'm worried I will go blank, panic and not know what to say then it will be awkward when we see each other at work.  I want her to like me but am worried my anxiety will scare her away.  What can I do I've rang the doctors but would like some advice from people who have actually suffered from it.  
Idk.	myself	Idk.  I guess I'm just so sad and lonely.  This feels like it will never end.  I'll just be lonely forever and ever.  At least I'm here for myself
I've	y'all	I've been depressed so long I have so much self pity it's unreal.  Throughout high school I thought it was depression, depression gives you lack of motivation as well but even with trying all sorts of antidepressants nothing changed ever.  Every new school it's gonna be different, first two weeks I'm already behind! I just feel like this really fucked with my head for years (there's the self pity!) And I just feel so hopeless.  Hope this wasn't too long for y'all
I've	projects	I've been off my meds for several months now.  I couldn't afford them.  Immediately after I ran out, I had a serious depressive episode.  Combined with the cash-flow problems, I got evicted.  And right around that time, the symptoms just. . .  Stopped.  The past few months, I have dealt with a laundry list of triggers.  High stress (being homeless is stressful), long work hours, lack of sleep, lack of food, strained relationships/loneliness, drinking too much, and my absolute worst trigger - cash in hand after being broke.  (It triggers mania like nothing else and I don't know why. ) And yet, I'm more stable and lucid than I have been in years, meds or not.  I was worried it was hypomania at first, but I have none of the hallmarks of a hypo episode.  No online shopping, no new projects
He has mood swings	when he gets different batches and gets violent	So here is the deal my son has had a bad kratom habit for 2 years.   <e1> He has mood swings </e1>   <e2> when he gets different batches and gets violent </e2> .  He also is a alcoholic and has not drank since a dui 8 months ago.  He got 6 years probation and He served 18 days in jail and when he got out all of his paranoia and delusional thinking had went away.  Now he has been on house arrest and all they check for is drinking.  He has started using kratom heavily and all of his delusional thinking paranoia and violent behavior has come back.  Can he use kratom while on house arrest and probation? It says on his legal paperwork that he is not to use anything.  If it is illegal should i turn him in for his own good?  
For	good	For the first time, flushed the rest of my weed down the toilet.  You know the old, I'm just gonna smoke the rest of this and then I'm done for good
I'm excited	this is first time I've been this sober since I was 19 and I'm 23	Today is my 30th sober and away from alcohol.   <e1> I'm excited </e1>  because  <e2> this is first time I've been this sober since I was 19 and I'm 23 </e2> .  I would like to thank SD as well every post here has helped me.

It makes you jealous, it hinders your confidence, it stops you from being able to live in the present and plan for the future	It's genuinely the hardest and most debilitating thing I've had to go through	Time is so valuable.  All depression does is slow down time for you.   <e1> It makes you jealous, it hinders your confidence, it stops you from being able to live in the present and plan for the future </e1> .   <e2> It's genuinely the hardest and most debilitating thing I've had to go through </e2> .  
The Body Keeps The Score' followed me around for almost half a year	I kept it at my side like a Bible	A few years ago I broke up with a long term girlfriend under difficult circumstances, and for some reason it broke me.  Exactly why something so trivial affected me in the way that it did has evaded me, but I have become more accepting of this. Instead, I have become more in touch with accepting how I experience the world now, and it has done me some good.  Reading this subreddit has helped too, and I am grateful for it and the community it sustains.  ' <e1> The Body Keeps The Score' followed me around for almost half a year </e1>  as  <e2> I kept it at my side like a Bible </e2> , and I have other recommended books on my shelf ready for when I next summon the strength to conquer one of them.  This past year I have made some progress towards putting myself back together, and I wanted to share that. I am very pleased to have made an account on reddit.  It feels good.  And I hope it continues to do so.  Thanks for reading.  :)
I	going?	I saw a therapist for the first time, and I can't help but feel like I shouldn't go back- happy to share why if that helps.  What about yours made you want to keep going? 
my	help	my gf took a larger amount of pills than she was supposed to and im concerned.  idk what she took she wont tell me and she told me she took an amount that she knows wont kill her.  i live about an hour away and i have no car so i cant see her.  i threatened to tell her mom or dad about it and she said she would break up w me/never talk to me again.  shes leaving for work now and idk what to do.  someone please help
I	strong.	I haven't relapsed, but it's hard to have a night off work and not think about smoking. Feeling a little resentful about the whole process, but I'll remain strong.  
I didn't think I'd have a craving that lasted for more than an hour before	It was just unbearable	I wish I hadn't smoked.  It didn't even satisfy the craving that I thought it would.  I got drunk and really should've known better.  I guess I just wasn't strong enough in that moment.  But I know better now.  I'm just embarrassed that I have to reset my day 1 all over again.  At least it was only 1.  I won't let it become 2 cigarettes.  Drunk as I may be, I know better than to ask for another.  I feel ashamed, but a bit better prepared for the next time.  I know I have to avoid this situation for awhile until cigarettes are farther into my rearview mirror.  No more alcohol for awhile.  It just makes the voice of addiction so loud and hard to ignore.   <e1> I didn't think I'd have a craving that lasted for more than an hour before </e1> .   <e2> It was just unbearable </e2> .  But no excuses.  Back to the drawing board.  I can do this.  
Today	better.	Today at work wasn't the best day.  It wasn't terrible but I wasn't there mentally.  I kept zoning out, thinking about absolutely nothing until someone snaps me out to gather their change.  I feel like I can't do the smallest thing without overthinking every small detail.  Basic math and memorization are suddenly my biggest downfall.  Forgetting orders or just messing up the easiest thing that makes others mad at me.  I'm not really looking for advice, just upset that this has been following for most of my life.  But I'm happy I discovered this sub, happy that I finally found people who feel exactly the same way instead of thinking it was only my problem.  Hopefully it gets better. 
I'm	Wow	I'm on my fourth set of roommates, and I've had this problem with every single one.  My roommates leave clothes in the washer constantly, and I'm never able to use it.  I have no idea what to do about this.  The way I see it, here are my options. Option # 1: Remove the clothes myself.  This is gross and feels like an invasion of privacy.  Regardless, I would do it if I knew it was socially an ok thing to do, or if my roommates were ok with.  But I'm too afraid to ask. Option # 2: Tell my roommates to take the laundry out.  This doesn't work for two reasons.  First, my roommates might not even be home.  Second, when I do tell them, sometimes they forget, and so 2 hours later I have to remind them again, and I feel like I'm being annoying.  Also, they might be thinking Wow
I knew i didn't want to smoke	i have made so much progress with my running	I quit successfully in October and was nicotine-free for 7 months.  Running a lot, eating healthy and meditating daily.  I felt great and was so happy to finally be smoke free. Some stress entered into my life when I had to move for school.   <e1> I knew i didn't want to smoke </e1>  because  <e2> i have made so much progress with my running </e2> .  I was chewing for about two weeks and vaped for a day. On Monday I started a coding bootcamp and it very mentally demanding.  I've made it the first two days without nicotine, but can't get rid of the thought in my head telling me I will perform better with my cigs. How can i think about this in a better way?
Today	YOU.	Today my mission on smokefree app this : who is the person that's most proud about your non-smoking?send them a message or give them a call to to thank them for how their support has helped. . .    Well, when i read this mission i realize that there is nobody around me proud about my non-smoking or support me for dont smoke!!! Almost all my friends are still smoker,if my mom is alive she feels proud surely but she she is not . so I realized that I stop smoking thanks to you ,the people on stop smoking, commented to my posts or no - doesn't matter, i read your experiences ,I see the days months years past since you stop ,i see your willpower. . . so all these sported me. . . So I'm the one most proud about my non-smoking and you are the people who their support helped me. . . . THANK YOU. 
every time, I'm full of regret.  Like I'm full of regret leading up to it, during it, and after it (within the dream).  Yet I still have the dream	the part that wants to get high as shit, and the part that is enjoying sobriety and is afraid of resuming the nightmare that is the heroin lifestyle	And  <e1> every time, I'm full of regret.  Like I'm full of regret leading up to it, during it, and after it (within the dream).  Yet I still have the dream </e1> .  I guess its because of the conflicting feelings within me:  <e2> the part that wants to get high as shit, and the part that is enjoying sobriety and is afraid of resuming the nightmare that is the heroin lifestyle </e2> . 
For	right?	For me, I have noticed I am getting a lot bolder in general - in a good way.  I am more open about speaking my mind.  If something bothers me, instead of keeping it to myself, I let people know about it right away.  I wish I could have been like this as a kid, but better late than never, right?
I	care	I was at my diploma class (a college class for kids who drop out to receive a high school diploma) and while at Job Skills my friend was fucking around on his computer and rotated the screen orientation sideways.  I burst out laughing, i laughed so hard and so long that i started tearing up and coughing, the teacher was not pleased at all with my shrieks of laughter being louder than her voice but i honest to god dont know why the thing to make me have a gut buster would be a sideways computer screen.  I'm losing it Edit: Everyone was staring at me like i was a freak but the sideways computer screen was so funny that i didnt care
always came from 1/2 my brain telling me to stop	I could see over time I was getting nothing done	The pain of quitting, for me as least,  <e1> always came from 1/2 my brain telling me to stop </e1>  because  <e2> I could see over time I was getting nothing done </e2> , and 1/2 my brain not caring about past or future and just knowing it felt good and I wanted it.  For months I tried to quit by having the first half overpower the second half, and while I could overpower it for 95% of the time, I always had moments of weakness that undermined the whole process.  So I figured out how to quit.  For me.  Maybe for you too, maybe not.  I decided to keep all my stuff, my herbs and equipment, in an air-tight bag.  I would then hide that bag in a nearby public place a roughly 10 minute walk away.  Now instead of my rational half arguing with my irrational half, I have my irrational half arguing with itself.  Should I do it? No you get nothing done But it feels good. . .  buuut putting on pants and going down the elevator
no matter what I do I can't concentrate	if he is in the house	I can't do anything right and  <e1> no matter what I do I can't concentrate </e1>   <e2> if he is in the house </e2> .  It's crippling.  Right now I'm trying to do homework and all I can think about is his restlessness. .  like he's waiting for me to do something interesting, it's hard to describe.  All he even does in his free time is watch the news, I'm 20 years old why would I be itching to discuss politics with my father?? like if you are bored then get some hobbies to occupy your mind.  Don't look to me to be entertained.  
Please	balloons.	Please send dogsHave been having suicidal thoughts the past week, culminated into today.  Clean for 2 months and felt like buying a knife, but I was just too numb and lifeless to even get off the bed. Stable now but animal companions would be welcome. Still feel like an absolute brat for wasting my parents' money and time and generally feeding off the world's limited supply of breathable oxygen.  Also I hate helium balloons. 
I'm	myself	I'm sorry I keep posting here so often.  But, I've really been thinking about quitting.  The only problem is is actually doing it.  I can't seem to take that first day off.  The stress of quitting isn't helping me, and then I over think so much.  I haven't had some major event happen to slap me in the face, but I don't want to live with this habit any more.  I feel pathetic that I'm not strong enough to stop for an entire day, even though ever part of me wants to.  I'm super conflicted and confused and sad.  Edit: when I drink and sober up I feel the strongest about not doing again.  It's in my sober moments that I relapse and can't help myself 
I always get nervous when people ask what music I like	people may think I'm weird	 <e1> I always get nervous when people ask what music I like </e1> , probably because  <e2> people may think I'm weird </e2> .  I listen to things between hard rock and some deathcore, so not the most common type of music.  
i cant say anything to my close friend	i get anxious	I know most people with SA struggle to make friends, but I have this friend who keeps on getting me into trouble with other people at school and i really wanna get rid of him, but everytime I tell him I dont want to be friends anymore, he gets one of my close friends to talk to me about it, so i get really anxious and say okay I frogive him, I really am tired of giving chances but  <e1> i cant say anything to my close friend </e1>  because  <e2> i get anxious </e2> . Any tips on how i can get rid of him permanently without my close friend talking to me about it??
I	feeling.	I know we get bored pretty easily, and I was just wondering what you guys have tried to try to get rid of that feeling. 
I've	hypomania	I've been chatting on both this sub and the schizophrenia sub.  I feel like I'm right in the middle of BP1 with psychotic features and schizoaffective disorder.  I have a lot of thoughts that could develop into psychosis, but my brain stops me.  I start thinking about how great I am, but I practice meta-cognition and say, no! I also wonder if people talk or think about me negatively, and I do a little CBT on myself.  I think about the situation in alternate ways.  Ultimately, I feel better about it.  I'm getting better at the social paranoia response. I'm curious if BP1 with psychosis folks can relate to this.  I wonder if the beginnings of psychotic thoughts are in your head, and if you have a firewall like me that keeps them out.  As I edge toward and into hypomania
I have been having increasingly terrible bouts of anxiety	I can only describe as depressed feelings for a while now	I hope it's ok to post this here, and if not, please feel free to point me in the right direction.   <e1> I have been having increasingly terrible bouts of anxiety </e1>  and what  <e2> I can only describe as depressed feelings for a while now </e2> .  While I don't take the word depressed lightly
Got picked on and felt attacked	I can't hold down a job	I hate family gatherings, but today was a MUST for my bday.  <e1> Got picked on and felt attacked </e1>  because  <e2> I can't hold down a job </e2> .   Got told to suck it up and work for income and that my rent will be raised.   Of course I blurt out something stupid like If I'm not happy with a job
I had a gun	things would be so much better	People who promised they wouldn't leave, but did anyways. Pushing everyone away, friends, family, etc. No dates.  Stable ones at least.  They always leave. That's the keyword, everything leaves you till you have nothing left, until you're depressed of everything. Depression. If  <e1> I had a gun </e1>   <e2> things would be so much better </e2> . 
I feel so happy	I buy a book	I like to collect graphic novels.  To be honest, I barely even like to read them anymore-- I have a huge stack of books on my to-read list, and they're just sitting there.  But  <e1> I feel so happy </e1>  when  <e2> I buy a book </e2> .  It's short and fleeting, but something about acquiring hings makes me feel better?Unfortunately that means
The work has been fascinating	it has encouraged me to delve more deeply into looking at certain aspects of language I had taken for granted before	Over the past 6 months I've been researching for a psycholinguistics project with bi-linguals.   <e1> The work has been fascinating </e1>  and not least because  <e2> it has encouraged me to delve more deeply into looking at certain aspects of language I had taken for granted before </e2> .  One of those has been the contextual application of adjectives. The word selfish is most often employed as a negative within social context.  You are a selfish little girl.  Stop being so selfish
I'm	soon.	I'm not sure why, but within the past year my mind has centered around the thought of suicide.  Before it used to be something I shrugged off as just one of those random thoughts running through my mind, but now they frequent much more often and I'm not entirely sure why.  Within the last two weeks, I've actually considered ways to go out.  My life has hit somewhat of a low point which may explain why these emotions of sadness and despair are coming out.  Still the whole 6 months of college, it had been running through my mind here and there.  I realized that these thoughts started forming whenever I thought about the future I set for myself and who I have made myself out to be.  It may just be the anxiety weighing in on whether I'll be successful or not, but I hope this feeling goes away soon.  
Like	disability?	Like the title says, I need a break.  I wish I could take a week or two off, go to my home town and just not worry about anything.  But I can't afford it, I'm only working about 23 hours a week at minimum wage.  My cheque tomorrow will be about $ 300 and I'm stressing about paying rent on time, paying bills, buying groceries and the supplements I need to make me feel normal-ish. I'm only working part-time but I feel overwhelmed sometimes.  I went six years without a job because of health issues and this all feels like too much at times.  A part of me wants to take the summer off and focus on my writing, but there's no way I'd be able to do that. There's nobody I know who really understands ADHD that well, so I have to rant to you guys.  While I'm here, is there anyone in Canada, more specifically, Saskatchewan, that knows anything about getting on disability?
I'll	hand	I'll start with a little background.  I am a master's student at university.  I don't recall the exact timing, but I started taking Vyvanse about a year ago.  My family is in the medical field and they are very quick to jump to the conclusion that people are abusing certain medicines.  I wanted to get evaluated if I had ADHD, not beg for drugs.  After a short discussion with my parents I went in to see a doctor.  He diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed me Vyvanse.  The medicine has helped me a lot.  I can focus on my task at hand
there is more than one person	I completely shut down and can't think of anything to say	I've never been able to function in a group setting.  When it's just me and another person I can usually keep the conversation going and even be funny.  I feel comfortable and actually enjoy the social interaction.  But as soon as  <e1> there is more than one person </e1>  it's like  <e2> I completely shut down and can't think of anything to say </e2> .  Anyone else has the same problem? How do you guys deal with being in a group?
Does	musicals.	Does anyone have a particular movie or band/artist that really helps calm you down, distract or cheer you up right away?For me its normally Ed, Edd n Eddy cartoons, the movie Home, and for music maybe anything nostalgic like Iron Maiden, Angra, Stratovarius, Sonata Arctica, oh and soundtracks like Disney songs, game soundtracks and musicals. 
My	&lt;sigh&gt;.	My BF is the best in all the land.  He proposed a road trip with stops in gorgeous Oregon all the way down to Carmel, CA.  Ending with my dream spot Monterey Bay to see the aquarium.  I've always wanted to go there.  So of course I freaked out and suggested we stay home instead to save money and work on the house.  &lt;sigh&gt;.  
it always gets shitty	at my core I'm shitty	I am tempted to make a list of every person with whom I've had a black and white relationship.  Friends, teachers, family members. . . eventually it all ends badly.  I imagine hell would be a court room where they all testify against me.  I love people, try to be friendly and kind, but  <e1> it always gets shitty </e1>  because  <e2> at my core I'm shitty </e2> . Would such a list be therapeutic or destructive? Maybe I could burn it or maybe use it to look for patterns. I wish I had friends.  I'm just floating into nothingness. 
I	Cock.	I was venting to my friend about everything that's been going on while they were gone on a trip and couldn't get texts easily, and a typo has inspired a nickname for my older sibling who [told me I need to have kids]( reddit. com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/6g30wh/hoo_boy/?st=J494QT9Q&amp;sh=623ffc17).  I will now be referring to said sibling in future posts as TBC, aka The Biological Cock. 
Things	.	Things were going really, really well.  Then boom, tonight it flipped for no reason whatsoever.  I've been considering going to treatment again for a while since self harm and suicidal ideation kept coming up, regardless of how well things have been going.  Hopefully this will be a turning point in my current treatment.  Also, hopefully I won't lose my new job. . . 
I'm going into debt $ 8,700 and I should be terrified about it.  Instead I'm at peace	I feel like I'm making a difficult but necessary commitment to making a better future	I have only told my therapist about this.  I'm not the best at keeping secrets and hiding things from my parents.  I'm getting reconstructive surgery in secret after I move out.  My parEnemies don't want me to get this surgery.  They would rather I live in pain and be a social pariah than get my needs met.  I've been waiting for years.  <e1> I'm going into debt $ 8,700 and I should be terrified about it.  Instead I'm at peace </e1> .   <e2> I feel like I'm making a difficult but necessary commitment to making a better future </e2> .  It's not going to be easy but it's going to be ok.  My parents taught me to be afraid of money.  But money is something I'm going to learn to manage.  I'm going to talk to a financial planner and live on a conservative budget. I move out so soon too!!! Just a few months. I can't believe I have the faith in myself to make these huge decisions.  Their power over me is fading!!!
Tomorrow	Thanks!	Tomorrow I graduate high school.  At least one of the boys who sexually abused me will be here.  Probably more.  I suffer from suicidal thoughts, trauma, abandonment issues, and an abusive home life (I am unable to get out of the situation.  That's a story for another time).  I'm gonna put on a brave face and try to enjoy tomorrow.  Some encouraging comments with maybe a hint of wisdom in them would be a lovely thing to wake up to tomorrow.  Thanks!  
Throwaway	vent.	Throwaway fo keep as anonymous as possible.  But I'm 16 living with severe depression and anxiety disorders.  I've had suicidal intentions and the like on the past but that was over a year ago.  Recently as I get older and I realize more abojt the real world, the more suicide doesn't seem like such a terrible idea.  Very few things in life make me happy, and those include making music and entertaining people.  Both of which are extremely difficult to succeed in.  Desk jobs and similar jobs drive me further into my depression and anxiety.  As terrible and as much as a pussy thing as it seems like, my general idea is attempt to do something with music or entertainment and if it doesn't work, just off myself.  I don't want to at the moment nor do I plan to.  But seeing how life is going omcnot sure what to do.  I'm simply writing this to get my thoughts out and to potentially act as a resource to go to to talk to people or vent.  
in	doing?	in my brain with hammer and nails putting up brand new walls, (giving me a headache), and they are washing the windows, (eyes are tearing) and they are even cleaning the air ducts, (ringing in ears is fading) also laying new carpet, (hair is growing back) it is slowly getting better, BUT IT IS! still shocked I made it finally, and so happy to be a part of this sub.  no supplements today, only a few cups of coffee.  Good morning everyone, and how are you all doing?
I	advance	I mean, trying to get a job but i'm encountering an issue. . .  its very hard to explain why i have years of nothing on my resume. .  what do you guys do? Im 24, finished highschool at 20, was assaulted and spent these last 4 years trying to get back up and now. . .  these 4 years are seriously weighing down my development, in more ways than i had antecipated. .  what are some of the things you guys say or do to go around this subject??Thank you so much in advance
im excited to get through the weekend	with the help of my wife and looking forward to being normal again	so as planned, i just took my last dose a few hours ago.      <e1> im excited to get through the weekend </e1>   <e2> with the help of my wife and looking forward to being normal again </e2> .     so long fuzzy head, so long constipation, so long toss and wash, so long scales and baggies,  so long anxiety, so long wobbles, so long headshops, so long poor memory, so long daily hangover, so long anger management!  so long!!     not exactly looking forward to the next couple days, but im looking forward to getting through the next few and being a new person.   
I made the mistake of switching medication from Welbutrin to Lexapro + Abilify and my anxiety has suddenly skyrocketed	I have a heavy aching in my head, my heart is racing and I feel like cold ice is running through my veins	 <e1> I made the mistake of switching medication from Welbutrin to Lexapro + Abilify and my anxiety has suddenly skyrocketed </e1> .   <e2> I have a heavy aching in my head, my heart is racing and I feel like cold ice is running through my veins </e2> .  I want to go back to the Welbutrin immediately but I'm afraid I've done damage to myself by trying another drug in the first place.  I'm scared as hell right now and I want to know how long until the Lexapro is naturally out of my system so I can go back to Welbutrin. PLEASE PLEASE do not tell me to go to the hospital.  The last thing I need right now is to sit in a waiting room for 3 hours and then wait another 3 hours to get checked out and so on. . 
I've	fighting.	I've always been the person that drops anything to help a friend in need.  I've gone through depressive spells several times a year since I was 10 years old and am currently going through a pretty bad depressive spell right now.  My friends know that I am struggling.  I haven't left the house in 2 weeks and they send me a text every other day asking how I'm feeling.  A friend texted me today and I told him that I was feeling even more miserable than usual over the past two days and all I get is a crying emoji.  Nothing else.  I've had suicidal thoughts for as long as I've remembered and I've even lost my fear of death.  Right now, the only thing keeping me from ending it all is my worry for hurting the people in my life.  Then, to see responses like these that show that the people I care about don't care nearly as much as I care for them, makes me realize that the number of people that I was staying alive for is dwindling, and I'm pretty sure I may not keep fighting. 
I kinda quit baking for a long time	depression	Ever since I read Charlotte's Web when I was four I have wanted to be a farmer and live in the country, and participate in county fairs.  Nmom has sabotaged so many of my hobbies and goals so I had given up for a long time. So this past week I've done exactly that.  I baked buttermilk biscuits, oatmeal cookies, peanut butter cookies and the most awesome experience of an apple rosette tart for a county bake-off. And you know what, I don't really care if I win; I am just excited to have done it.   <e1> I kinda quit baking for a long time </e1>  because  <e2> depression </e2> , no more.  (I might enter some heirloom flint corn and some snap beans in another fair in August, and maybe some homemade canned goods like raspberry jam and blueberry preserves and dill pickles. . . )
I don't have really anyone I can contact that can help me	I'm just really horrified  and need someone to talk to	I'm home alone and the screams get louder every minute.   <e1> I don't have really anyone I can contact that can help me </e1> .   <e2> I'm just really horrified  and need someone to talk to </e2> .  If you can message me that would be nice.  Thank you
I am worried particularly with regard to erectile dysfunction	they say nicotine can cause that	I'm an otherwise healthy 25 year old male.  I smoked cigarettes for a little over a year and then used ecigs to gradually wean off.  Finally I have quit nicotine completely 2 years later.  I haven't noticed any big problems yet but  <e1> I am worried particularly with regard to erectile dysfunction </e1>  as  <e2> they say nicotine can cause that </e2> .  What do you think my likelihood of permanent damage is? 
My	her?	My mother has moderate anxiety that shows in extreme feelings of paranoia.  I live in a upper-middle class neighborhood that just has idiot teenagers who like to do dumb shit at night like taking taking lawn ornaments and moving them to a different.  Last night they placed two goblins at our front porch and when my mother saw them she paced around the house integrating my siblings and I and threatening to call the police.  How can I help her calm herself to relive the hardship that it causes her?
Has	experience.	Has anyone ever gotten tired of daydreaming? I find that if I start spending too much time daydreaming than I normally do (which translates to a TON of time), I get kinda burned out? Or more like I realize how trivial all of my favorite scenarios and plotlines get.  Especially since I like to repeat similar scenarios in different ways.  For a couple days or if I'm lucky a week or so I just kinda feel like there's no point to them, but it always comes back.  Especially if I watch a new show or rewatch one, I get all inspired and am fine.  Just wondering if anyone's had a similar experience. 
It takes me forever to do	I get so anxious I just proof read and proof read	I am the least anxious person I know in many ways- very little scares me.  But I get extremely anxious about writing.  And writing anything.  Responding to messages, writing notes for my neighbour explaining how to feed my cat, writing emails to colleagues.   <e1> It takes me forever to do </e1>  because  <e2> I get so anxious I just proof read and proof read </e2> .  Objectively, it doesn't matter if I make mistakes and I'm not sure I would care if I did but there's something about writing anything turns me into a complete perfectionist. I've got an email to reply to at the minute.  I need to write something about 2 lines long so I've been thinking about it for about 2 hours and putting off doing it because I'm. . .  afraid? Of what, I really don't know. When I try and Google the problem, there's lots of people talking about essay writing anxiety, or email writing anxiety and nobody talking about writing anything at all anxiety.  Does anyone have any advice? The advice I'd probably give myself is go and see a therapist
I	it!	I put this in the DCI but felt like saying it again, forgive me going on and on about it.  I ran my first 5k in ages yesterday! I was mentioning it over at r/sdrunners too.   It was blazing hot, but my young (20s) friend, her roommate and I all motivated each other and got through it.   I finished 8th in my age group (meh) and came in at 35 minutes (meh) but most importantly I finished, and felt awesome about it.   This is what stopping drinking has done for me!!  50 pounds lighter, looking better, able to do things like 5Ks where I feel good about myself instead of passing out drunk on a chair at home!  I was excited and proud and already planning the next one.  As always I thank all of you - the support and wisdom and stories of what you all are doing keep me inspired and focused.   Sobriety is a gift that keeps on giving - the clarity you gain, the people who inspire you, the fitness you can achieve - I love it!
i needed to go to a mental institute to receive help	i wanted to get better mentally	i posted here several days ago about how my boyfriend was replacing me.  i ended up telling him  <e1> i needed to go to a mental institute to receive help </e1>  because  <e2> i wanted to get better mentally </e2> .  the one i went to actually lead to more trauma (it was a very cheap institute and handled terribly/i was put in the violent wing for being in crisis) but i got prescribed antidepressants to help me battle this depression anxiety im facingas soon as i got out, he let me rant and rave about how much i missed him, how happy i was to see him and talk to him, how much i loved him, how i was thinking about him my entire time in there and how he was the only reason i stayed okay in there.  then he broke up with me and, i was replaced by the person i was afraid was replacing meim absolutely heartbroken and really want to commit suicide now but i cant.  i cant go back in there, and i cant go back on this path im trying to stay on.  i want to do so badly but i dont know what to do
Haven't	worse.	Haven't gotten out of bed yet.  Have to be at a work function by 5.  I just want to stay in bed and sleep.  My anxiety is probably at a 5/10 right now but I'm afraid when I get up and get moving it'll get worse.  
Hi	alcoholism?	Hi guys, I need some help and feedback.  My older brother died because he ingested nothing but vodka and drugs for a long time.  He was really isolated, and didn't want a relationship with his family (me included), and I'm so grateful he had friends who were like family to him.  I'm his legacy contact on Facebook (just means I can add and delete things basically).  His friends are asking what happened, and because he was so private, I don't know if I should tell them the truth.  This is pretty hard for me, too, but I can't imagine how hard it must be for the people he chose as family.  His online friendships seemed to be very important to him, and I  want to tell them, and I probably will, but I just wanted to get some perspectives from people who aren't directly involved.  If anyone has thoughts or opinions on what you would do in my situation, I would welcome them.  Tl;dr: Should I tell my brother's concerned Facebook friends he died of alcoholism?
Even	delusions.	Even compliments from nim are insults to my character.  All the voices and confusion and pain from within that I don't recognize as me is nim.  When I am putting in effort toward completing a goal, they are like a talk radio station in the next room that I can hear.  When it talks about me, I have a laugh and feel a bit flattered.  If I'm  tired, I might get distracted and join in the conversation.      When I am meditating, I am clearing my mind of everything except for what is going on between the boundaries of my imagination and the boundaries of my awareness, I can hear them but their words, and the images and emotions they have claimed they are transmitting through the use of high technologies, are meaningless.  When I'm close to finishing my meditation, I might join in the conversation. My favorite activity: Thinking, has been compromised.  This is where the constant chatter has power and attempts to hijack my thoughts with random religious and persecutory delusions.      
If I'm in any sort of crowd my voice gets drowned out	I get even more embarrassed and start stuttering and talking even more quietly	Anyone else have this issue? It feels like I repeat everything I say throughout the day.  I don't think it's an issue of volume, my voice is kind of deep, and I don't think it carries well.   <e1> If I'm in any sort of crowd my voice gets drowned out </e1> .  And then of course when this happens  <e2> I get even more embarrassed and start stuttering and talking even more quietly </e2> . . .  It's a very annoying and unfortunate problem as someone who is trying to interact with more people on a daily basis.  Does anyone here feel my pain, have you found/tried solutions?
I already have horrific symptoms from the Valium taper	Feeling super scared for my life	Hey guys. . .  So I am in the middle of tapering benzos which is hell it's own right.  I have been on Kratom for 6 months to get off Suboxone.  50 percent of my hair has fallen out and I'm afraid the Kratom is masking some of my benzo withdrawal symptoms.  I am in hell!! I really want off Kratom. . .  I can't take any supplements that work on the Gaba receptors because of my benzo withdrawal.  I was going to try to cold turkey it but after reading this thread I don't think that's the best idea.  I haven't had any Kratom in 24 hours and I am a stay at home mom that will have kids all week when things get bad with no help. .  So obviously I should taper? I am not sure about grams but what I usually took was equivalent to one tablespoon twice daily of mainly red md or sometimes red gold.  Any help would be appreciated!  <e1> I already have horrific symptoms from the Valium taper </e1>  (was on that for 7 years doctor prescribed and am only making 10 percent reductions per month) <e2> Feeling super scared for my life </e2> ! Thanks guys!
For some reason the process of going to sleep with ADHD can be impossible	laying still is just so boring	 <e1> For some reason the process of going to sleep with ADHD can be impossible </e1> , since  <e2> laying still is just so boring </e2> .  Boredom leads to a strangely active brain, and a long night until pure exhaustion kicks.  I recently stop relying on NyQuil to speed up this process and have just lost sleep.  Going to bed early just doesn't seem to work, I just lay there for hours aggravated that I can't sleep.  
it becomes really discouraging	when someone going through the same thing discards you as a partner	I always felt like dating was inherently selfish--by dating someone, you're assuming you're good enough for them and that you can fulfill a romantic role in someone's life well enough.  It's become pretty clear to me that my mental health issues are suppressing whatever (likely small) potential I have as a person in a lot of respects, and I can't really blame my ex-girlfriend for becoming frustrated with me (despite being depressed herself) and leaving me given how down I always was.  I know you're supposed to learn to combat depression yourself, but  <e1> it becomes really discouraging </e1>   <e2> when someone going through the same thing discards you as a partner </e2> .  Sorry that this is kinda disconnected.  I'm just kind of typing at 4 am and seeing what happens. 
I'm not really concerned about where she'll go	her life is like, almost over	tl;dr - rent is 895, for me and my mom.  mom cant work b/c shes disabled so im paying for like, everything atm.  She has some money left in the bank account from selling the house and moving up here as well as about 230 a month for being on disability.  I want to move out  <e1> I'm not really concerned about where she'll go </e1>  because  <e2> her life is like, almost over </e2> .  she just sits down smokes watches her tablet all day.  goes nowhere at all.  Only thing she is good for is being there when i drive to work since I dont have my license.  other than that a complete burden. Just think of how depressing it is to see the money you work hard for every month, over 50% of it goes to the freakin rent?  That's just rent alone, you see why I want to move out huh ? My mother is literally a burden.  I can move out with a friend we just have to find a place. 
I'm	(	I'm going through a weird period at the moment.  Two years of constant depression is beginning to lift but I find myself both frustrated by my seemingly slow progress and also constantly undermining my efforts to get well. Last night instead of going to bed at a sensible hour I had several beers followed by enough caffeine to keep me awake all night then studiously watched YouTube.  Going to bed became frightening.  I don't really understand it, on the surface it is ridiculous. I think I am afraid.  Afraid of what to say to people.  Afraid of all the work that I need to do.  Afraid of not coping.  Afraid of being alone.  Afraid of my rubbish financial situation.  Afraid of the expectations I imagine people have of me.  &lt;/rant&gt; Despite all my efforts to create a life for myself everything ends in failure.   I want to hide : (
Like	advice?	Like everyone else:I'm terrified of all of the mental AND physical feelings of detox/withdrawal :(But I was already hopeless &amp; suicidal ON Percocet for 10 years -- so I figured I had nothing to lose by trying to QUIT. Day 3 off Percocet &amp; on Amino Acids -- while I don't feel good; it's not anywhere as bad as I expected.   I feel flu-like w/ bad headaches + a bit nauseous -- anxious &amp; not too depressed but not very hopeful either and ZERO motivation to get out of bed to do anything except read books or read/post here! Hubby says it's the Amino Acids helping to minimize my detox symptoms. . . + I got 3 Rx from doc for migraine, nausea, stomach before I started this. . .  glad I did. I'm feeling bored &amp; anxious &amp; hopeless &amp; sick yet ZERO Motivation to do Anything but read read read book after book after book (stocked up @ library last week) -- Any advice?
I	gum?	I started using the gum 2 weeks ago and the past week I'm having symptoms of asthma and its getting worse, I've not had these symptoms since I was 7, put on this machine and it cured it 90% besides a flair up when I get into thin air. I've smoked for almost 20 years and not one issue or symptom of asthma till I started this gum. . .  I'm so confused and I have 6 unopened boxes of gum lol. Anyone else had issues with this thrive gum?
It's	anymore.	It's somewhat comforting reading other people's struggles here and finding myself in some of the stories.  But, like with the group therapy, it doesn't solve my fucking problems and so far, I think nothing will.  I don't know if anyone else here became hopeful when they first started treatment. Only to come crashing down when it didn't work.  This has happened to me so many times, I've started to just lose hope in general.  There is so much happiness out there that I will never get to experience, not in the state I'm in now.  Some times I feel so close to feeling better, yet it always gets yanked away. It terrifies me to even try now.  If I take the drugs my doctor gave me, I will be happy for another week or month.  And then it's back to square one.  Why can't the doctors just fucking help me, I'm sick of this shit. I don't have the will power to go on anymore, I'm at the end of my rope, I just don't know what to do anymore. 
So	peers	So I managed to get an interview for a job that I don't feel qualified for.  I'm set to graduate in my field this December, but was told that I need to start looking for a job months before I actually need it.  So I have this interview tomorrow morning, and I am afraid of how I will answer questions, such as Why is your GPA lower than most of your peers
Started	that.	Started on 10mg, then went to 5mg + 75mg wellbutrin.  Lexapro did wonders for my anxiety, but I expected my sex drive to gradually return over time.  It hasn't.  It's making my boyfriend cry because he misses when I used to want him.  I miss it too.  Lowering the dose and adding wellbutrin only helped a tiny bit.  I don't even think the wellbutrin is actually doing anything, I think it was lowering the lexapro that did it.  Now I can want sex but it's rare.  I don't want to feel like this, despite the great progress.  I want to change something but I'm afraid I'll get anxious again. I went from hyperventilating and crying in the car to being able to practice driving with a smile.  From screaming at bugs to letting them crawl on my hand.  From isolating myself to being very social.  But yet, I feel like I turned asexual.  I don't like that. 
I	suicide.	I was deeply suicidal for three months, tried to buy an illegal firearm (I'm 16) and multiple times sat on the edge of a bridge inches away from jumping.  I had such a rough semester at school, at home was rough for me and I lost all my friends practically after being depressed for about a year.  Two months ago I was put on anti depressants, started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist.  It's made such an incredible difference.  If I didn't get help two months ago I would be dead.  Getting help can't hurt it can only help so please try.  I know my case of such improvement is rare but please get help.  I honestly wouldn't wish severe depression onto anybody and I don't want anyone of you to commit suicide. 
I wont be able to survive without a full-time job	college is gone for me	18. Been depressed for a few years.  My grades at school were not bad but that doesn't matter anyways.  My parents pretty much need to retire and  <e1> I wont be able to survive without a full-time job </e1>  so  <e2> college is gone for me </e2> .   Now that I have to get a shitty job, I wonder how long I could endure it.  From where I live, a regular job will be 9hours and 2 hours of transport per day, that makes 11hours and I just dont think I can get through that for years. Sorry dor the long post, appreciate everyone who read this. 
Was	wow	Was a bit tempted today, friends had cold ciders and beers and whiskey and vodka etc. . .  But I stuck with La Croix and ginger ale and root beer and water.   We swam until the thunder rolled in and then went to my buddy's house to BBQ.   Later in the night after playing guitar and watching some fire dancing my buddy said, wow
I	much.	I was wondering how often you all find yourself crying.  Anywhere from just a few tears to a full blown meltdown.  Is there any triggers? Does it seem to be caused by nothing?  Is it a word, a phrase? A thought? Just feeling suddenly overcome with an intense feeling and thats the only way to feel better?  Im just curious, perhaps as a persoal study.  Maybe just to have a better frame of reference.  Whats ornal whats average.  What do you think is healthy? When does it befome too much or a problem.  How do you know the difference between a good cry and a bad cry? Im sorry i dont know if this makes any sense.  I am just vey sad right now and ive beeN incredibly manic all night.  Ive also got work in 4 hours which isnt helping much. 
Just	com/topic/self-care	Just some tips that were shared with me when I needed them the most.  Sometimes we forget to lok after ourselves (I'm guilty of this, all the time) but if these make any of you feel better then it's worth it.  verywell. com/self-care-strategies-overall-stress-reduction-3144729 self. com/topic/self-care
Is	:(	Is that a typical side effect? I'm up to 15mg twice a day.  It helps with my anxiety some, although the past 2 days I've removed a lot of caffeine from my diet as well and no panic attacks.  I feel anxious sometimes though.  Maybe anticipation.  Anyways.  Since being on this 15mg of buspar I can fall asleep easy about 11pm but it's like clock work I'm awake at 2 or 3 am and absolutely cannot sleep for shit after. . . .  It's exhausting.  I toss and turn all night after that.  I do have Ativan I could take I suppose but I only wanted to use that for panic attacks if needed.  Benadryl? Prescription sleep meds? Idk what to do.  Miss my sleep :(
I was hesitant to post here	I was planning on going into more detail but worried that someone I know might connect the dots leading it back to me	 <e1> I was hesitant to post here </e1>  because  <e2> I was planning on going into more detail but worried that someone I know might connect the dots leading it back to me </e2> .   I'm came to the point where I realized that I've been alone my whole life.  You get what you give mentality.  I care a lot but I don't show it.  I was raised by baby sitters almost my entire childhood.  I grew up not learning much from my parents about anything.  I got involved with bad kids leading to stupid thinking.   My mom and dad 'love' me but they never show it to me.  and I am today thinking that is what love is.  Just thinking of them but not showing it.  This really made my heart ache.  This really hurt me in the long run because I feel in love with this beautiful
Hey!	those.	Hey! So I will be quitting Kratom CT tomorrow after about a month of daily use at roughly 15-25 grams per day.  Thankfully, I've only been using for a month, and it helped me stop smoking weed after years of being a stoner.  I have also cut out alcohol too.  I have Gaba, fish oil, multi vitamin, and some adrenal vitamins.  I also will have 30 1mg Xanax tomorrow, prescribed by a doctor.  I'm thinking this will help me fall asleep.  My question is: should I pick up something else? What can I expect after only a month of daily use? Thanks so much for everyone's support.  I'm genuinely excited about beginning a life of sobriety.  I have so many interests, and I'd like to focus my energy towards those. 
Suicide	call.	Suicide used to be a thought that just kind of dangled outside of the breach when I was depressed.  Whenever it would come close I was able to fight it off.  The last 5 months I've started to let the thought get closer and closer.  It's selfish to want this.  It's foolish to think that flipping the switch on my life would be so simple.  I used to let mortality drive me to fight, push me to be better but I just can't anymore.  I'm so tired of trying to be okay.  I'm so sick of watching family and friends get frustrated when they try to help.  My life hurts.  My willpower is exhausted.  I am a parasite that nobody should have to deal with.  It might sound self absorbed, but I really truly believe that I shouldn't have to put up with me either.  As long as there is still a shred of hope left in me, I will not act on this.  But every day it feels like there is a little less. .  and a little less. .  I just feel like I'm not too far away from that curtain call. 
I	now.	I moved out just a few days ago leaving much of my stuff behind.  I experienced such a feeling of dread on the way here, but now I feel much better.  It's such a peculiar feeling to not have to feel emotionally responsible for my family's feelings.  It's such a weight off of my shoulders.  I'm also very lonely though.  I have my boyfriend here and my sister, but it's still hard to get through the day.  I'm sure it will get easier as time goes on, but I have no idea how to cope with all of these issues that my Nmom has left me with.  Now that I'm not here to be constantly berated and told what to do, I feel like I no longer have a purpose.  Don't get me wrong, that was a miserable existence, but now I just don't know what to do with my life now.  
I'm on a too-low dose right now	it doesn't usually help much	I forgot that there's caffeine in tea and drank a cup of black tea while on Ritalin.  I feel terrible - Super hyper and can't focus.  I usually take a second Ritalin at lunch.  Should I skip it? Can I do anything to come down from this? Or would it maybe help with the inability to focus?  <e1> I'm on a too-low dose right now </e1>  so  <e2> it doesn't usually help much </e2> .  
Pros	com/dp/B00IJ3PAIM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T2_n-xuzbBXB96H9)	Pros of cold brew:* less acidic* more flavorful* cold weather friendly* ***YOU LITERALLY MAKE IT THE NIGHT BEFORE AND YOU GOT COFFEE FOR THREE DAYS**** Yes you literally throw some grounds in a thing and then leave it in the fridge overnight.

So,	;)	So, I have stayed smoke-free for more than 4 months. .  Tbh, at this point the good days are more than the bad ones, as in - there has definitely been an improvement in both my mental and physical well-being since I quit, BUT I still have really bad days and a myriad of weird symptoms :(( And I don't wanna just moan and whine, I am looking for some advice on how to combat that. . I started eating right and exercising (been doing yoga almost every day), I did some tests (full physical,chest X-ray and stomach ultrasound) and it all came back clear. Latest installment in the quit smoking fun ride has been mad sinus congestion and headaches :/ Guess, I also had underlying hay fever on top of everything else, so now that I quit my sinuses are messing with me :((Any tips and advice are very much appreciated :) /end rant ;)
I quit	a relationship with a woman who was repulsed by smoking	I (38M) used to smoke.  I smoked marlboro methol lights for 10 years (yeah. . . ) and 6 years ago I quit.  I smoked 5-10 a day but way more if I were drinking, which I often was.    <e1> I quit </e1>  for  <e2> a relationship with a woman who was repulsed by smoking </e2> .   My attempt was to do it cold turkey.  But I often caved and would still smoke one with my morning coffee.  Then there were those after meal cravings.  I often caved in that first month and would have one here and there.  After that initial month of cutting back, I did quit cold turkey.  I had cravings for a year.  Morning Coffee, a cocktail, and after a meal, and even if I saw someone on TV smoking.   But the cravings usually lasted 20 minutes then gone.  After a year, I never had another craving again. I'm really glad I quit smoking.  The smell really bothers me now.  I did it.  So can you, wishing everyone here strength, encouragement, and kindness. 
I still think about smoking	I freakin' loved it	 <e1> I still think about smoking </e1> , because  <e2> I freakin' loved it </e2> , but I am so happy I gave it up.  I have saved a ton of money, I feel so much better, I love flavors and smells. . .  it's great. You can do it! It's tough but it's worth it.  
I'm glad	my partner has decided not to do 4th of July this year	 <e1> I'm glad </e1>  that  <e2> my partner has decided not to do 4th of July this year </e2> .  My PTSD comes from my pacemaker/defibrillator going off a couple of years ago and shocking me 4 times.  Her brother constantly has to use the loudest fireworks and destroying stuff, which always makes me look for cover, and I usually end up inside hanging out by myself for most of the night. 
Hello	do.	Hello there,So I'm a 17 year old boy and I'm currently with a 17 year old girl.  I won't be getting into specifics.  A lot of the time I notice that I have these moments where all my feelings for her fall right out of me, I want to be alone and have my own space.  My heart get's that same feeling as you would with anxiety like I'm battling with my feelings.  I find myself googling my problems to see if I'm being anxious or not.  I have literally no idea what to do. 
Ten	today.	Ten days! I'm happy to be back on the right path.  Double digits feels good.  I won't drink with you all today. 
I'm proud	have gone 11 days CT without relapse	The experienced ones on this sub know what I'm talking about.   <e1> I'm proud </e1>  to  <e2> have gone 11 days CT without relapse </e2> , but now I feel I'm left with nothing but a gloomy outlook on life.  Compensating with massive exercise and work.  Will also change my antidepressant.  Fortunately, my sex drive is taking command ( 3 years of K use had shrunk it to nothingness).  Let's all push through this deceitful tunnel :) 
Idk	well.	Idk how to phrase this and I'm trying not to make it sound like some fucked up romanticised bullshit but part of me doesn't want to recover.  I don't know why, depression was the worst thing that's ever happened to me and it's giving me the most boring time of my life and I want to kill myself but for some reason. . .  I just feel like I'm going to miss this feeling? I've only felt depressed for the past 2 years but I can't really remember life with out it.  Sorry I really can't explain this, at least not very well. 
I'm out of the honeymoon phase now	I still have ADHD	So it's been a little over 6 months since I started medication and got my diagnosis for ADHD.  Overall the pills are great at keeping my moods regulated and my attention focused (ish).   <e1> I'm out of the honeymoon phase now </e1>  so  <e2> I still have ADHD </e2>  and I am not living the plot of Limitless anymore.  So my question is: how do others in our situation handle long term self-directed goals? I have SOOOO many projects (music, language, programming, woodworking, etc. . . ) But it's hard enough starting most of them let alone sticking with something once you start it.  I've tried chains and other pat-on-the-back methods, but I don't get that warm fuzzy feeling after completing a task my Norm-y friends and family talk about.  So I guess I'm curious what other people do when theres no deadline or external pressure to do something and stick with it. 
I	inevitable?	I have been getting slightly better over the last few weeks.  I felt like I was making some progress, I've been doing more of my school work and it's been over four months since I last self- harmed.  Yet each day I was still depressed, still am.  Like this is all just building up to my downfall.  I've been skipping meals again, and I feel like I'm going to relapse any day now.  I still think about suicide often and even make plans.   <e1> I don't think I'm in any danger of killing myself soon </e1>  so  <e2> don't worry </e2> .  I know I should seek therapy but I'm too anxious to talk to anyone.  Although posting here does help me vent a bit.  So do/have any of you experience/experienced this, where everything seems to get better but you still feel like killing yourself is inevitable?
Channel	it!	Channel that anger into getting off this crap! I am so mad at getting sucked into the Kratom vortex and thinking I was clean for almost 9 months from Suboxone.  There are literally no one having a hard time on Facebook and it makes me think they are all still taking it. . .  or it's taboo and such a money maker right now.  Get mad and get off it! 
Tomorrow	Thanks.	Tomorrow I have a dental appointment for deep tissue cleaning.   This is my first without Xanax.   I am anxious and fearful of having a panic attack.   Any tips to avoid this?   Thanks. 
I have a panic attack	me spiral into a feedback loop of fear	Sometimes  <e1> I have a panic attack </e1>  that makes  <e2> me spiral into a feedback loop of fear </e2> .  This happens when I am already feeling low and some exterior force exerts a pressure.  I tend to fixate here. Sometimes I have a switch that goes off in my brain.  In a moment I am fearful.  I think this happens when I stop taking my medicine and other times when the medicine just isn't enough to keep me above the 'line'.   I tend to be able to ride this out. I am not sure that I really even have a question.  Just a thought that occurred to me today.  Anybody?
Hey	boat?	Hey everyone.  I'm a bit concerned about my friend who is shooting his suboxone. Little back story. I'm an alcoholic and my friend is a heroin addict.  We actually met while in recovery two years ago.  And he had a coupleasant stints of using last summer and once this past winter.  He got off it in Feb and got on subs.  I only recently found an orange cap in my car and called him out on it.  He admitted to shooting his subs instead of eating them like he should. I'm just not sure what to do.  He says it's not as dangerous as heroin and I get that he won't likely OD but this can't be good for him.  Anyone ever been in the same boat? 
I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone	I don't want anyone to make fun of me for it	 <e1> I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want anyone to make fun of me for it </e2>  if I tell them so I'm writing it here.  
Even	understands.	Even if you have to send them a text.  Sometimes just knowing someone else knows how you feel can help make you feel less alone.  They might even be able to help.  Don't feel like you will be a burden on them.  If they really care about you, they will want to help.  I hate talking about how I feel.  It makes me feel awkward for some reason.  I had to text my mom this morning about how I was feeling.  I'm glad I did.  It hasn't been awkward at all like I thought it would be.  Just knowing that she knows is comforting.  I also don't have to pretend to be happy, and she understands. 
I'm	.	I'm so nervous and anxious.  I don't know how to calm myself down.  I'll be washing dishes and stuff which is fine.  But they say I'll eventually be doing the cash register and stuff. .  can I tell them I can't do it? :( I hate my anxiety. .  I hate this. . 
I	tell.	I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety about but about year ago I noticed some weird sensations I would get in my body such as tingling sensations, burning, headaches, balance problems, and I've had trouble concentrating.  I've had episodes where I just shut down and won't talk to anyone.  I went to the doctor for all of this and they had no idea what was wrong with me.  One doctor said it could just be eenage angst but it affects me daily.  It makes it difficult to function sometimes and I've gotten increasingly worried about my health.  At certain points in the last year I've been convinced I was dying of cancer or something.  I've thought my lymph nodes have been swollen for the last year but I can't tell and whenever I google symptoms I convince myself I have diseases.  I think I might have an anxiety problem but I can't tell.  
I	diary.	I have a long distance relationship, but he's unhappy with me and with other matters, for the time being.  I know I love sharing our meals, and it's always a special thing to me.  But when I'm at home, I sometimes wish I had somebody, a real friend, of the same gender. . .  to talk to and go out with to McDonald's, a sports bar, or the Japanese restaurant a few miles away, for instance.  To talk about our days, laugh at politics or discuss our watched TV shows or Disney movies, and drink beer or having pina coladas at the beach while laughing about lady problems.  Things like that. Those days I feel lonely and it's self inflicted.  Most of the time I want the quiet, but other times, I. . .  wonder.  This will probably go by unnoticed, but that's fine.  Just had to put this down somewhere as well as in my diary.  
I	myself	I was doing so well this year with my alcohol and cocaine addiction.  Cut out coke, and was moderating the booze. Got triggered last iast night with my CEO and went on a coke, booze and porn filled benderCrashing hard right now.  Having skipped heart beats and anxietyI am super disgusted with myself 
for	everything	for the past 6 months I've felt like i haven't really been completely here, like I've left my body and my spirit is someone else body.  I've become a complete stranger to myself and i don't know who it is that looks back at me in the mirror anymore.  i'm scared that this feeling wont go away and i don't know how to fix it.  i feel like a robot and feel like i'm not in control of my movements.  sometimes i feel like i'm unable to show any emotion in a situation where i need to show how i'm feeling and sometimes i'm unable to control my emotions and i burst into tears at anytime.  i feel like i'm hollow and i feel like this all isn't real or a dream.  i feel so detached from everything
Today	drink	Today I'll be going to my friends house where they'll be drinking.  I'm planning on staying sober but I'm a little worried about how I'm going to cope.  I've used drink in socal situations for ages and this will be my first social event in years without drink
Hello.	size	Hello. Nothing but the same story. Single 24 year old male with a mess of a life.  Jobless, living with my mom and other relatives.  It sucks to be home without a single thing to do, with lots of screaming and arguing everyday over stupid shit.  It sucks.  I like to be chill and quiet not angry and disturbed all the time in the comfort of my own home.  My own room is just a prison, a confinement. Yeah it's stupid, I'm not doing as bad as someone in jail or homeless, but I live a very restrained life. A life where I can't get stronger if I wanted to.  A life without any friends and the family that lives with me are no people to be considered friends.  My family is so broken up.  It's a good size
I woke up at 6am and my heart still felt like it was beating fast	freaked me out a bit	I have a fitbit watch which allows me to monitor my heartrate all the time (this has been a good and bad thing).  I've noticed that often when I drink alcohol the night before, my heartrate will be high while I'm sleeping (~20bpm higher than normal - around 60), and the next day. Last night I noticed my heartrate was unusually high before bed, at around 80+bpm.   <e1> I woke up at 6am and my heart still felt like it was beating fast </e1>  which  <e2> freaked me out a bit </e2>  and I struggled to sleep again.  I did go to a social event last night, but I only had one beer which is why I'm finding it strange why my bpm was raised 10-20 during sleep as it would if I had drank much more. Today I'm just very anxious about this and it's bothering me a lot at work.  I also have a chest pain, but I know that feeling always seems to happen to me when I'm stressed at work, and goes away when I get home. Not really sure where this is going.  Anyone able to share an experience/insight to help me feel more at ease?
Hi	all.	Hi SD, I just wanted to share a little light with you all this morning.   The longer I am sober, the more mellow I am becoming.   I think back to all of the small things that used to trigger me to cry or become angry, and I notice that I'm learning day by day to let the little stuff go.   Yes, I used to drink &amp; have made some poor decisions, but today, I will not beat myself up about it.   Today, I will be kind to me.   I rather like the new mellow version of myself.   I think she was always inside me, waiting for me to rescue her.   If you are feeling low today, just remember, we are all in this together.   I have your back, and I know you have mine.   Internet hugs &amp; well wishes to you all.  
I	weeks.	I never dreamed that I would begin to enjoy things sober.   I am amazed the boredom only lasted a couple of weeks.   I am shocked at how bad I used to be at PC games.   I'm amazed that I'm not saving money like I thought I would.   Instead, I am spending about the same amount taking my kids places.   When I hit 30 days, I'm going to schedule some indoor skydiving as a reward.   Something that kinda scared me just a month ago is now something I'm really looking forward to. I'm amazed that I feel better.   Even though I'm tired *all the time*, I'm finding that I feel better than I used to.   I actually remember the night before.   My marriage is going better than it has in years, and now the wife is saying she'd like to quit drinking as well. I am amazed that I'm able to be more productive at work.   I'm a quick learner again.   I'm amazed at how much better things are now, and it's only been 3 weeks. 
I feel like I'm too ugly to be in a relationship	I withdrawal and then fall into a suicidal pit of self loathing	22 year old female.  I have a very unstable sense of self, and usually it's tied to whoever I'm interested in.  My self esteem is always bad, but when I have someone I'm interested in I try way too hard to make myself look attractive in ways that are dangerous. . . .  aka restricting food (i struggle with anorexic) and wanting to blow money i don't have on plastic surgery.   <e1> I feel like I'm too ugly to be in a relationship </e1>  so  <e2> I withdrawal and then fall into a suicidal pit of self loathing </e2> .  Maybe relationships aren't for me right now 
im goimg through waves of depression	i know there is a solution out there	I have been living with this for 32 years, since witnessing the space shuttle challenger explode in person with my terminally ill father.   Ive tried everything under the sun (legally) to shed my anxiety and not let it run my life.   Ive been on xanax, clonazepam, ativan, lexapro, etc.   Nothing has ever given me a full release. Until, 2 months ago i had an appendectomy.   And i was on oxycodone for about 4 weeks.   Never have i felt the weight of the world lifted from me, never have i felt the reprieve from anxiety as i did on that medicine.   I actually broke down in tears with the release of my anxiety.   I was able to enjoy family time with the kids and wife, i was able to go out and not feel irritated  and constantly rushed. Its unfortunate that this drug will never be perscribed for anxiety.   Now  <e1> im goimg through waves of depression </e1>  because  <e2> i know there is a solution out there </e2> , but ill never be able to mitigate anxiety, ptsd, and agoraphobia with it. Im feel depressed. /rant
we had to go home early	I couldn't walk	Another relapse.  This one found me being carried down the stairs of a bar/music venue by my brother, who now knows how bad of a drunk I am.  He was in town to have fun and see live music.  I got trashed and  <e1> we had to go home early </e1>  cause  <e2> I couldn't walk </e2> .  Right now, the shame I'm feeling is keeping me sober.  I know the shame will fade, I'll feel happier in a few weeks.  I will want to go out again, relapse again once I've forgotten how bad I feel today.  How do you stay sober after you're done feeling like garbage, once the fresh sting of shame has faded?TY for reading
I	today.	I don't have a lot to say, or anything super insightful.  Just wanted to share my accomplishment! Getting sober was the hardest and best thing I've ever done.  I now have a far better relationship with my wife and children (who I may have lost if I had kept drinking), I've saved over $ 10,000 I would have spent on liquor, I'm down 60lbs, and my mental health issues have all but disappeared.  Whether you're on day 1 or day 10000, keep it up! I will not drink with you today.  
I really did not want to go smoke	I felt like crap	2 hours shy of 48 hours.  Back in April I quit for 42 days; however, a stressful personal issue was what I used to begin smoking again.  I've smoked for 20 years, well over half of my life.  For almost a decade, I did not know I was an addict.  I believed that I just enjoyed smoking.  It wasn't until I was very sick that I realized that I was a slave.  I got a craving and  <e1> I really did not want to go smoke </e1>  because  <e2> I felt like crap </e2> .  The craving grew into a beast and I caved.  I did not want to smoke but I HAD to.  I was horrified that this thing that I thought I had control over (I just smoke whenever I WANT
I	flaws	I might be jumping the gun, but I'm so excited right now.   I had a notion that I might have adhd when I was 19 and went to the doctor, who said I would be referred for assessment but nothing would come of it and I should learn to accept my flaws
I relapsed	I didn't want to believe this plant was as bad as it really is	Hi friends! Today is day 100 since I had a 2 month bender/relapse after my 2 year daily cold turkey quit last year.  Anyway, doing great and haven't been thinking about Kratom at all.   <e1> I relapsed </e1>  because  <e2> I didn't want to believe this plant was as bad as it really is </e2> .  I learned a hard lesson, even after only using for 2 months and in far less quantities than before, withdrawl was hell! It's ridiculous how long it takes to recover from this crap.  You'd think if you used for 2 months, worst case scenario you'd be paying the piper back for those 2 months and be back to normal.  Not so much!It does get a hell of a lot better and being off the green saw dust is very worth it.  I feel extremely healthy now and will never make the mistake of dabbling in this crap again. Stay vigilant friends!
I'm	anxiety.	I'm frustrated.  My boyfriend of over two years is severely depressed (medicated and in counseling).   I feel like he puts no effort into showing me he cares.  Or is that just hard to do when you're depressed?  I'm trying to understand but it's giving me anxiety.  
Positive attention helps me feel less depressed	I know there is someone there who cares and wants to help me	I want the spotlight on me all the and I hate it it's ruining my life.  It makes me feel like shit that I crave attention and validation over everything else.   <e1> Positive attention helps me feel less depressed </e1>  because  <e2> I know there is someone there who cares and wants to help me </e2> .  However if I can't get that positive attention I will do whatever it takes to fill my attention needs weather it be attracting positive or negative attention.  I feel even worse about myself knowing that I'm like this.  It brings my stress levels to 100% all the time and in turn it makes me very angry, depressed and just overall emotionally unstable.  I feel like I'm very close to my breaking point and don't know what to do anymore.  Please help me. 
I'm	&lt;3	I'm leaving for a month to go out of country tomorrow and I decided that I'd skip the hassle of dealing with prescription medication.  I also wanted to see where I'm at with my ability to function after 2 medicated months.  It goes without saying I'm super nervous because.  Just thought I'd share, wish me luck &lt;3
Thanks	back!~SP	Thanks to all you fantastic people and the help of doctors, therapists, peer groups, and so many others, I've hit two years sober today! I couldn't be more grateful to this sub and all of your stories and support; I owe you all so much.  I never, ever thought I could do it, but here I am, *definitive proof* that even the most stubborn, frustrated, miserable drunk can find solace in sobriety and learn to celebrate and embrace a new way of living.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you, and keep coming back!~SP
he never heard of Strattera	I would like to have some medications to suggest to him when we meet(preferably something that is not known to increase liver enzymes	My doctor's out of town until the 14th but then I intend to go talk to him about switching up my medication -- Ideally to something that won't raise my liver enzymesSo far, from what I've been seeing, most ADHD drugs, both stimulant and non-stimulant, seem to be processed by the liver and can cause elevated liver enzymesAnyone in here have high liver enzymes and are a bit concerned about taking drugs that could potentially raise them higher? IF so, are we out of luck for medicating our ADHD?Note: I have a psychiatrist who is hard to get appointments with, doesn't answer the phone etc, and then an awesome GP, but who doesn't know much about ADHD I'm meeting with the GP and I know last time we met,  <e1> he never heard of Strattera </e1>  so  <e2> I would like to have some medications to suggest to him when we meet(preferably something that is not known to increase liver enzymes </e2> , so Vyvanse for one is not one I would consider)
I'm	listening.	I'm a nurse.   I'm in my mid 30's and finally diagnosed with severe ADHD.   I've told a few other nurses and my manager because A.  It explains a lot B.  They pretty much already know and C.  I'm an open bookHowever every single nurse I've told about my recent official diagnosis  has said I wish I could be on Adderall so I could lose weight.    To me this just highlights how mental health issues are seen as a joke.   They'd never say that to someone on chemo.   It kinda upsets me and I wanted to vent. Thanks for listening.  
I	time.	I haven't been this down for a looong time. 
I'm	circumstances.	I'm an ignorant but curious what make people insomniacs especially factors connected with personal decisions in contrast to arbitrary circumstances.  
im	instead	im so sick and tired of admitting to people im sad all the time and my smiles are fake only for them to tell me to see a doctor and get some medicine.  ive tried that.   made me insane.   i wish theyd jusy offer to talk to me and try and understand instead
There's been times where I haven't checked a response at all	I've been so afraid of what a person has written	 <e1> There's been times where I haven't checked a response at all </e1>  because  <e2> I've been so afraid of what a person has written </e2> .  People could be asking me for more details on my post, and there's me just nervously avoiding the responses. . . 
the comedown was what I imagine one feels as a cocaine addict after a three day binge, going cold turkey	you ran out of snow	I really wanted the convenience of a once a day capsule and not having to carry my medicine around. But alas, that shit was evil.  I was getting terrible headaches, and  <e1> the comedown was what I imagine one feels as a cocaine addict after a three day binge, going cold turkey </e1>  cause  <e2> you ran out of snow </e2> .  Except that I wasn't looking for more, because fuck that. The instant release at the exact same daily dosage is completely different.  I take 15mgs in the morning, then 7. 5mgs twice (30mgs/day), each dose spaced 3-4 hours apart.  I've done this in the past, and never had a problem.  It slowly leaves my body in the evening, and it's working great again now.  Although I can feel a slight comedown, it's nothing like the XR.  It's very gradual, and the medicine lasts all day with good results.  As an unbiased barometer, the amount of disorganized paper on my desk at work has already been reduced since I switched back. Just thought I'd share.  Apparently the delivery mechanism can make a huge difference. 
Sometimes	down?	Sometimes I sit down and think about my life and I feel like anyone else with my problems would have shot themselves already.  I feel like shit what do you do to calm down?
i have social anxiety	A. D. D	Ok first of although  <e1> i have social anxiety </e1>  which is greatly due to  <e2> A. D. D </e2> , I do everything to avoid looking like I'm a nervous guy.  I almost over do it.  In this case after work I was walking omw home and some dude/Roadman was walking towards me.  Anyways I stare into his eyes a bit too much.  I do this all the time and I generally look annoyed.   So anyways as we cross path he ask me if  I have a problem.  While reaching into his man bag.  I stressfully say nah man.  But like wtf.  I hate that I do this.  I don't blame him either for telling me off.  I just hate that I have this annoyed looking face.  When actually I'm just a humble guy.  *a lil pussy*
is no one's fault but my own	i'm so easily replaceable	day after day is wasted doing absolutely nothing, everyone is either already disappointed with me or is fooled into thinking that they wont be.  i can never be bothered to go outside.  i've stayed inside my room for months at a time never leaving, so much so that my anxiety has wrapped itself around my psyche causing depersonalization episodes.  i've ruined a good portion of my friendships and the friends i currently do have would choose someone else over me in a heartbeat, which  <e1> is no one's fault but my own </e1>  since  <e2> i'm so easily replaceable </e2> .  i don't know how to stop being so weak-willed and finally put an end to my disgusting existence.  i've felt this way for so many years yet i've never bothered to actually go through with something
they feel so realistic	i'd love it if these dreams would stop happening	So I am now on day 118 of not smoking and i literally have NO urge whatsoever to smoke in real life.  But probably 3-4 nights a week for the past few months i have dreams where i have an absolute dying urge to smoke.  So strong that usually i end up buying weed in the dream and then packing a bowl and pacing around my room in deep though about if i should break my streak or not.  Sometimes if there are friends present in the dream i end up breaking down and smoking.  Has anyone else experienced this? I feel as though part of my subconscious is still strongly addicted to weed but when i'm awake there is no urge whatsoever.  I have a job interview on wednesday and last night i had a dream where i convinced myself that i could smoke and get it out of my system before taking my drug test next week lmao.  It's like i'm a crackhead in my dreams and have no control but  <e1> they feel so realistic </e1>  so  <e2> i'd love it if these dreams would stop happening </e2> . 
Addiction	times	Addiction begins and ends in suffering  --  Gabor MateI drank in happy times
Hi	ideas?	Hi guys, I know everyone goes on about this naked mind etc. , but are there any good novels that help fight off the urge to drink? I am reading some of John Cheever's short stories at the moment and they paint a very stark, bleak portrait if the alcoholic, which I find helps not want a drink.  Anyone got any ideas? 
It's	awesome!	It's day 5 for me and this morning when I woke up I felt so disappointed in myself.   I thought I had smoked during the night, then like 30 minutes later I realized I dreamed it.   Then I realized I'm dreaming again, this is awesome!
I see them with someone else and of course I don't say anything	I don't want any drama	Before summer break came around I thought summer would be fun.  Fun as in going out with friends, late nights, movies, getting ice cream, going to Cedar Point.  But now that summer has started, I've only been sitting in my room allllllll day every day.  When I'm home bored out of my mind, I see people on their Snapchat stories going out with their friends, having fun, and doing all the things I wanted to do.  It bums me out every.  single.  time.   It bothers me because I reach out to my friends to hang out but they say their busy or make whatever excuse.  Usually later in the day after I ask,  <e1> I see them with someone else and of course I don't say anything </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want any drama </e2> .  I've applied for jobs to keep myself busy, contacted them many times, and nobody will contact me back. I'm tired of being at home almost 24/7 and I want to have fun instead of sitting in my bed feeling lonely and overthinking everything.  I noticed the farther it gets into summer, the more depressed and lonely I feel.  
Like	day	Like one small thing will happen and then I'm sad and upset the whole rest of the day
Ive	gone.	Ive been depressed since I was 13.  Started smoking weed at 14.  Started doing cocaine at 19.  Dealt with an eating disorder at 12 which came back at 18.  I am now 22.  I have a job, but pay is spent on booze, coke and cigarettes.  I eat, but throw up.  I drive high.  I have unprotected sex.  I use my mother's credit card to buy stupid things.  And now im sitting here after a coke binge last night.  I have decided to kill myself tomorrow.   Im thinking pills.  I dont desire to live anymore.  I have no dream, no will to live.  I care about nothing and no one.  I just want to be gone.   
Nobody	myself.	Nobody else in my life would understand this but I know you guys would. All my life I have been shit at school and academic learning.  I've been medicated for almost two years now.  I heard today that my assignment for a professional qualification scored 80%, one of the highest marks given.  I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT PRIOR TO TREATMENT.  I am so god damn proud of myself. 
Posting with a throwaway	I'm being a stupid pathetic wimp	Just have a stupid cold or something that feels like it's gone on forever, and for some reason being sick is almost triggering or something - just intensifies the dissociation, like that brain-fog on top of my usual brain-fog, and feel like I just have to stay in a daze and not think or feel anything until I'm better, just can't deal with anything while feeling physically bad.   And I have so much other stuff going on in my life right now, it just feels like I'm at the breaking point, I can't deal with feeling lousy on top of everything else, I just can't do this. Not sure what I'm looking for here, pretty sure no one has a magical instant cure for the common cold or they'd be a billionaire by now.   Just complaining I guess.    <e1> Posting with a throwaway </e1>  because  <e2> I'm being a stupid pathetic wimp </e2> . 
All	:/	All right, I used kratom every day for 8. 5 years, but finally managed to quit after going through rehab in April.  I managed to stay clean for about 80 days, and it was great, but I then relapsed.  I just finished off my last capsule.  I have been using for eight days, a total of 80 grams over that 8 day period.  How miserable do you think I will be? I am now in a place where it will be impossible for me to get kratom, and will be for the next three months thank god. The withdrawals when I quit for the first time were an absolute nightmare and some symptoms lasted five weeks. . .  Just using for a week won't have totally reset everything, right?  :/
So,	though?	So, most of this is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and I might just be feeling sorry for myself.  Apologies in advance. I just got a borderline 1st for my 4 years degree, through a moderately respected university.  I have three kids (one with ASD), a full time job, a happy marriage and a recent diagnosis of Adult ADHD. I've always been pretty non-academic through life, preferring practical application to academic achievements; when I applied for a degree, my mother told me I wasn't booksmart enough to do it. So it's a real one up for me, that I've defied expectations and managed to not only pass, but pass well.  Why do I still feel shitty though?
Please.	angry.	Please.  I don't know where to start.  I hate myself.  Any attempts to seek help clinically or otherwise have always ended in failure.  My state has fluctuated in the long term, just as i've grown up, but I have not found a time or place where I feel alright, even if there are times when I am not as bad.  Every time I think I make some process through personal growth, I am hit with this feeling again and it just proves that this is a constant problem I have with myself, even if my self changes over time.  I hate myself so much.  I used to hurt myself so much.  It has decreased significantly in the past few years but I still want to, so bad.  I still give in sometimes.  I can't help it.  I hate myself so much.  I get so angry at myself. I can't even always explain why.  Most times it doesn't even matter.  The issue is me.  Not my attributes.  I hate myself so much.  I don't know who to go to for help.  I don't.  Nothing clinical works.  NOTHING.  I feel so stupid and alone and angry. 
To	drunk	To be honest with you guys I thought I would have a lot more to say.   I have actually looked forward to this day and back on day one never believed I could get through day one let alone day 365.   But the truth of the matter is that today has just been like the past 364.   I really only need to worry about today!  When you break it down like that and you stack 365 of them together, it really only matter what I choose to do today. The last night that I drank wasn't too far from every other night except that I got into a stupid othing fight with my wife.   This was after weeks/months/years of trying to quit only to fail again and again.   This night though - I actually really contemplated that it would be better for my family if they didn't have a drunk
There	though	There is nothing wrong in my life, loving family, some friends, no money problems I can buy shit I wantWhy do I feel so low though
I	pls.	I finally got my new pc I was waiting for so long. .  but it comes with problems and it needs to go back to fixing . .  such luck ffs.  And depression didnt let me be happy when I received it. .  kill me pls. 
My	**	My follow up diagnosis is Monday at 8:30 AM and I cannot wait.  I feel like I've been in a fog for the past month and all I can focus on is my mental health.  I'm emotional, I don't want to see anyone, I don't want to do anything.  I'm trying to do a few small projects to get going on what I need to do but I just am not following through on anything.  I went on a binge of downloading productivity apps and haven't used them. I know it's just step 1 in the next phase of my life.  I know I likely need therapy after this.  I know a diagnosis or medication is not the answer to all of my problems.  I have a lot of self-healing to do.  But it's going to be a sigh of relief to hear definitively what is happening in my noggin and to start the next steps!**TLDR; Counting down until Monday when I find out my official diagnosis and hopefully start medication. ** 
I	bed.	I feel worse today than I did before i started taking the meds with the exception of not having anxiety attacks today to go with it.  I've felt wonderful the last few weeks and really hope that it wasn't just an initial boost but I feel horrible today, felt like I was going to break down all damn day so far.  Can't wait to go home and go back to bed. 
I know that I'm strange	today I've opened League of legends to play	This post doesn't have a precise sense, I just wanna share this with you anxious redditors :)Get ready to waste some timeI've always had few friends, and now that I suffer from loneliness I'm trying to not lose my actual real friends (they're 3). Quite a paradox huh? A shy person that feels lonely,  <e1> I know that I'm strange </e1> So,  <e2> today I've opened League of legends to play </e2>  and saw that she was online, and had a little panic.  Didn't know if I could ask to her if she wanted to play (and how) or just invite her, I waited for a bit (as always, i can talk with her of deep things but I struggle to say her a simple Hello
I'm just starting on making music	it's not great	I wrote and sang a song about some of my feelings and just wanted to share it here.  I'm not a singer and  <e1> I'm just starting on making music </e1>  so  <e2> it's not great </e2>  but it's something to keep my mind busy.  I'm honestly a little embarrassed posting it but I kind of want to know if I'm just delusional thinking I have any talent and constructive criticism. [My song]( com/mercury-nocturna/solitude-better-mix)Edit: I have 2 more original songs on my SoundCloud now as well.  AFewNights and Dread. 
Yup,	well.	Yup, what I thought was OCD all these years is most definitely OCD.  Surprise! Feels like a weight has been lifted off of me.  I'm anxious for the road ahead, but I can't believe I waited so long to reach out.  I'm going to contact the psychiatrist my therapist referred me to and try to get on some kind of medication as well. 
I	fine	I am 16 (almost 17 ) years old and i have no one.  I can't recall ever having a real friend.  I theres this girl that I grew up on the same street with, but she's the type of person that only contacts you when she has no one better to talk to.  And she will cancel plans AFTER we are supposed to hang out. Now this girl doesn't realize how lonely I am.  Either that, or she simply doesn't care.  There are times that she asks to hang out, go to the mall or catch a movie, whatever.  When this happens, I get SUPER excited.  I get ready, I pick out an outfit to wear.  You know, something that I think I look okay in even though I hate my body. .  And as I'm waiting outside either in the humid rainy or steaming hot weather, Im happy that I am finally getting out of the house but after I wait for 20 minutes, either soaked from sweat or rain, I get that text that says i'm sorry!! I can't make it.  and of course i reply that thats fine
i always reasoned it was ok	its just weed	Hey leaves,for three years straight i have smoked weed every dayI always thought that weed would never be an issue for me.  Every time i smoked the thought would cross my mind 'maybe i shouldn't be flushing so much money/time down the drain on a plant'.  But without fail, the very next morning i was getting high again.  I knew i had a bit of a problem, but  <e1> i always reasoned it was ok </e1>  because  <e2> its just weed </e2> .  Honestly everything was fine until recently.  everything has slowed down
my motivation has hit rock bottom after being held in for 3 month	my manic episode	all i do all day long is watch youtube / streams , the only reason i go out is to buy food. nothing outside interests me , it even annoys me , makes me just wanna get back to my room.  What good is going through the hardships of life if u cant even enjoy anything in it ,  <e1> my motivation has hit rock bottom after being held in for 3 month </e1>  because of  <e2> my manic episode </e2> .  
Heads	anything.	Heads up I'm writing this on a throw away account so that it's not connected to me.  My younger sister (15 years old) started cutting a few weeks.  Right now my parents and I are trying to get her help, but she doesn't know that we know she cuts.  My question is what are some ways I can help her without her knowing that I know she cuts? Because I can't just let her go down this dark path without doing anything.  
My breathing has been bad	my anxiety	 <e1> My breathing has been bad </e1>  bc of  <e2> my anxiety </e2> .  It's like I keep having to take a deep breath.  I'm scared to go do stuff that I usually do like basketball,chill with friends, go to the movies, etc.  how do I help my breathing and not be worried about this 
So	activity	So sick of the internet being my default I'm bored and everything is too boring activity
With	exhibitionism.	With Monica's reckless abandon for her family and suicide attempt and codependancy issues, it does feel very real and something I fear I'd become if I came off my meds or never got hospitalized and properly diagnosed.  Then with Ian, I don't quite sympathize with the mania because I'm Bipolar II, but the impulsivity I can and the exhibitionism. 
As	win.	As someone who is struggling to quit kratom, I am interested to see the relapse rate of kratom.  I know other opiates have a high relapse rate, and I think kratom is no different.  From looking at all the people on here trying to quit, I would guess that the relapse rate on kratom is close to 90-95%.  Of course that is just a guess, but to actually see the a small sample size would be interesting to see.  Maybe the mods can answer this better.  What does everyone think the relapse rate for kratom quitting is? What are the reasons? What can one do to ensure success? I am really writing things down and trying to schedule out this quit so that it can be organized, and I can have goals to follow to steer away from kratom.  After failing recently, I know that I have to have a plan.  But I have so much anger at myself for relapsing, it is becoming unhealthy.  I just want to win. 
I	me/13344257	I have the notion that the far majority of successful quitters did so cold turkey.  I am interested to know what the distribution of cold turkey vs.  continued nicotine administration of this subreddit is.  strawpoll. me/13344257
From	it.	From the ages of 5-11 I was sexually abused by my stepfather.  He went to prison for it when I was 11.  He is to be released from prison in mid 2018 (he'll have been there for a total of 15 years).  What do I do if he contacts me? I've signed up for notification of his release.  I've really been avoiding thinking about it but as it gets closer I feel myself getting more and more anxious.  I don't know if he'll try to contact me.  I definitely think he'll try to contact my younger brothers (who are his biological children).  I don't think they plan on communicating with him but I'll definitely talk to them to make it clear they should not talk about me if he does contact them.  Has anyone here been in this situation before? Sorry if this is all over the place.  I just feel so overwhelmed by it.  
I	guys.	I need some positive vibes.  I start classes today to finish my bachelor's.  I got back on Adderall (which I hate) just for this.  I'm nervous as hell.  I've got 6 months between me and my bachelor's and then I'll be working on my MBA in Economics.  It's going to be hard, but I know I can come here for support.  Luckily I only have a couple of classes to take that I won't be interested in.  Those are the ones that get me.  Wish me luck guys.  
Hi	hard.	Hi folks!After twenty years of gaming addiction, I finally did the right thing.  Believe me, I tried to quit several times over the years, but I never tried it thoroughly. I relapsed this weekend as countless times before and was ashamed of and distgusted at my behaviour.  When I was on my way home from work, I thought about, what to do and I was finally able to honestly tell myself, what was holding me back: I was used to have everything backed up.  I had my online accounts on steam and GOG and I had my box in the basement in which I stored old CDs and DVDs, manuals etc. So today I used my anger and disgust and got rid of it.  To get rid of Steam and GOG I used a temporary mailadress and I threw the CDs, DVDs and manuals in the bin. Whish me luck.  Withdrawal will be hard. 
i dont hate it	we aren't doing enough	with my trust issues and my detachment and the pure. . .  like, uncomfortableness that just appears whenever the opportunity to even remotely interact with others, i don't know that i'm meant to feel anything but numbness or pain. i've had a whole past of meeting people who i loved and having them ripped from me, or, more likely, me messing things up.  im going to get a job to help people who are hurt like us, but i think that's the only thing i can do in life.  when i'm old, or when i finally decide to kill myself, i'm going to go deep into the wilderness, listen to my music, and lay down and die. **p. s. ** i hate that there are so many people posting to this subreddit and they never get a reply.   <e1> i dont hate it </e1>  because  <e2> we aren't doing enough </e2>  or i hate those people for posting, but i hate that this exists.  where there are so many hurt people that just can't get help.  like we're all dying in dark, cold alleys, and we can't yell, we can only groan and whisper for help. 
being so depressed and still getting good grades and having friends	guilt	I know it sounds retarded or like I'm trying to brag but in all honesty <e1> being so depressed and still getting good grades and having friends </e1>  had given me this pit of intense  <e2> guilt </e2> .  I feel like I don't deserve to be getting grades, telling jokes, meeting people or laughing.  Because I feel like others deserve it more than I do.  And there's always people saying Well your life is great you have no reason to be depressed!!! Which in turn always makes me feel guilty for my mental illness.  But I can't shake this feeling that I don't deserve my life
Does	.	Does anyone feel like their depression or anxiety actively tries to make you more depressed? I was doing pretty good for the past few months but lost it this weekend and thought I would be happier without a relationship and she'd also be happier not seeing me this way.  Woke up feeling so empty and completely destroyed.  Understandably she is being pretty cold and doesn't want to talk. .  
I	.	I posted on here a week ago opening up to strangers for help and support. . . .  I've gotten no such thing since being on here. . . .  this page claims to help but it doesn't.  I've grown more depressed and my feelings of sadness and now all turing into anger and frustration. . . .  it's hard for me to not just snap on my own kids my beautiful loving baby boys do not deserve that. . . .  please anyone I just need someone to talk too. . . . . 
Does	Thanks!	Does anyone have any experience with this?  From the tiny bit of research I have done, it seems like you can point customer service to a certain clause called something like user termination or something like that (will go back and look at this again tomorrow).   Otherwise it looks like they usually don't allow people to delete their accounts?  Looking for any workaround that might be possible.   Just wanted to know if anyone had any thoughts on this before I went ahead and tried to get it done. Thanks!
Hey	me	Hey guys.  Some of you may know me from the HPPD and DPDR boards.  Well, yesterday, my long distance (mutually open relationship) FP revealed someone else significant to her.  Regardless of the nature, and regardless of the fact that I know deep down that we need to live our own lives, it sent me on a massive spiral.  I never thought there was any possibility I had BPD.  Reading into it and how accurately the classification fits so much of what I've gone through in my life fucked me up.  All of this shit converged and I ended up going on a massive bender, eventually ending up with some dangerous people.  I'm safe now, but I'm terrified of myself.  I don't know where to start with any of thistldrI'm new here, and I'm scared of this disorder (or whatever qualities of it I present with) and the power it gives my emotions over me
I	Why?	I take afexor or however you say it.  225 MG  and I missed it for some time the other day.  I instantly became suicidal and wanted to die.  Why? 
He also said he can't keep speaking to me one-on-one	if I choose not to go to dinner with them both tomorrow, it'll probably be the end of our communication	Hey guys.  So I've been NC with my NMum now for just over a month and it's been the happiest, calmest, most peaceful month of my entire life.  During this time, I've been seeing my EDad about once a week, whom I love heaps and don't want to lose.  He's been continually telling me that NMum wants to see me / trying to re-establish a relationship between us, even though he said he recognises the things I described in NMum's behaviour and me constantly telling him how much happier I am.  Fastforward to tonight.  I get a text from EDad saying that, for my birthday tomorrow, he wants to celebrate with me and my NMum, but he can't see me on my own.   <e1> He also said he can't keep speaking to me one-on-one </e1> , so  <e2> if I choose not to go to dinner with them both tomorrow, it'll probably be the end of our communication </e2> .  I'm so angry, hurt and sad (not to mention totally invalidated) and I have no idea what to do.  Has anybody had a similar experience or any advice? Thanks all.  Feeling very lost.  
Do	mosquito	Do anybody else's parents continue to obsessively monitor when they take their medication even though they are past 18? I am on vacation with NDad and he will not stop asking me if I really need that stuff or he won't stop talking about how the whole reason I need it is to stuff down your anger.  He loves to talk about other people's emotions a lot- he tells me I am angry on a daily basis.  He even told me his friends don't think I should be taking medication.  Like it's even ok to talk about that?!?!He is like an annoying mosquito
I asked her for help	I'm going crazy	Hello.  I'm being scolded by my mother as I'm typing this.   <e1> I asked her for help </e1>  bc  <e2> I'm going crazy </e2> .  I feel like I'm wasting my life.  I feel paralyzed and stuck and there's SO MUCH I want to do but I just can't move forward.  It's been particularly bad for the past two years.  She always tells me I'm just lazy and irresponsible.  She literally just told me you're brilliant
Is	of?	Is something I see a lot when people refer to mass shooters and such.  But I've been suicidal for over a year and all of this hatred in me is making me homicidal as well.  I don't know where to go for help.  Where is this help people speak of? 
I've only recently come to terms with how abusive my childhood was	I'm just jealous of people who have it better than me	I don't know what to do about it, but I always get this irrationally angry feeling whenever I'm around other people's families.  My housemates have all had their families come to visit in the last few weeks, and it's just.  It's hard.  Watching them interact, knowing that they love each other, hearing their parents praise them in front of me.  I never got any of that.  My mom would go out of her way to make sure that everyone knew how badly behaved she thought I was.  My dad loves making fun of me in front of his friends and our other relatives. Every time I'm around other people's families my heart just hurts.  Because that's what it's supposed to be like.  It's supposed to be support and love and actually looking forward to seeing people, and I never fucking feel like that.  Maybe it's because  <e1> I've only recently come to terms with how abusive my childhood was </e1>  or maybe it's because  <e2> I'm just jealous of people who have it better than me </e2> , but I always walk away from the dinners or whatever with other people's happy families feeling hollow and drained and just breathlessly sad.  
I threw in that I don't drink	I know drinking and being unable to drive on the 4th of July is almost expected	I love telling people I don't drink.  I doubt they care as much as I do, but I guess I'm proud of my willpower or something. I left a note for my coworker who is coming in this afternoon (I work in a vet clinic and we have holiday kennel duties even though we're closed) saying that if he needed help this evening, I can always drive over.   <e1> I threw in that I don't drink </e1>   because  <e2> I know drinking and being unable to drive on the 4th of July is almost expected </e2> . . .  and I wanted to have a bragging moment. Maybe my attitude is above it all.  Don't know.  But I've broken 200 days now
I	level	I thought it might be a good idea to start a thread of silver linings to recovery that people can share for motivational purposes.  Some people will throw up in their mouths at the thought of trying to be grateful for having such a debilitating condition and I'm ok with that.  I understand that ; ).  But the truth is there are very special rewards in there for people who decide their lives are important and valuable enough to fight for.   Feel free to add any you may have.  I'll start with the ones I can think of off the top of head:A full range of emotional expression without shame or fear of judgment.  When I'm angry at someone I can express that in a non abusive way, just as when I feel depressed or sad I can acknowledge these things in myself in a healthy way instead of running or repressing these egative emotions.  When anxiety is worked down to a manageable level
Hi	all!	Hi everyone.  I came across this group awhile back and it piqued my interest.  I've noticed my irritability level increase over the years and am curious to see how cutting out alcohol effects my mood.  I'm trying out at least 30 days to start and see what happens.  Wish me luck and Happy 4th to you all!
I'm posting here	I'm too lazy to write a note	I've recently returned from a certain summer camp (which will remain unnamed so I don't end up hunted down and thrown in a padded room) and it was a generally good if not underwhelming experience, but it was the only thing I've cared about for the past year.  Without that to look forward to my life is back to its typical aimlessness.  I'm back to hating everybody I talk to and feeling only fleeting instances of an emotion that could only loosely be described as positive.   <e1> I'm posting here </e1>  because  <e2> I'm too lazy to write a note </e2>  and don't care enough about anyone to address it to them, so I felt obligated to let a few strangers on the Internet know.  The shotgun is calling me. 
A	come?	A question going out to all of you, that have been sober for quite a while:After my first few days without alcohol I feel super optimistic, super energetic and very enthusiastic about everything.  I started losing weight.  No more stomache ache.  No more constant feeling of depression. But there's this sneaking suspicion that these positive feelings won't be there forever.  That I'll have to face harder times.  That the euphoria of the beginning might vanish.  And I'm scared.  I'm scared that I might relapse as soon as this first euphoric phase is over. Am I just seeing everything through rose-colored glasses at the moment? Might depression come back as soon as those first days are over and the disenchantment sets in? Or are the feelings that I experience right now just how life feels when being sober (because it feels damn good right now ;-) )? How can someone prepare for the harder times that might come?
Original	SD.	Original post:  reddit. com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6k8pra/sd_i_need_your_support/For those who commented on Friday, I wanted to let you know that I remained sober all weekend.  I honestly can say I had the most fun out of everyone who attended the party.  Over the course of the weekend, I heard many affirmations regarding my sobriety.  Many of the girls couldn't believe how much fun I could have sober.  Others appreciated how I was able to keep things organized.  Overall, I'm really happy and proud to say that I survived while gaining more confidence and appreciation for my sobriety.  Thank you, SD.  
Not	1).	Not sure how I feel about it.  I called my sponsor who is in a meeting. I confessed a lot of personal things in it.  Just looking for some perspective on it. I did cheat in the past but I already told her that.  But I went into detail about what I did and also some other problems I struggle with regarding dealing with temptation from the opposite sex. I told her not to read it when she saw it on my coffee table but she did anyway when I was away.  She left it open to a page that had a lot of stuff.  My perspective is that I was trying to change but she is just reading text, no context no idea what the questions were I was answering (this was step 1). 
I	understand.	I self harmed for two years non stop and then two years on and off.  I've managed to stay clean for a year and a month which is the longest I've ever stayed clean.  Two nights ago I started again and have been doing it every night.  I still don't really understand why I want to self harm.  Why is it that when I'm sad and depressed I want to just cut myself see the blood drip down my body? I don't understand. 
2	behalf	2 AM, even though I said I'd be gone until then.  Three missed calls in 30 minutes.  On the Fourth of fucking July.  She wasn't mad at all, just genuinely panicked.  She has this ritual where she does not let ANYONE in the house sleep unless I'm home.  It's nauseating.  It's like some fucked-up nighttime ritual and I feel so worshiped by my Nmom.  But it's no surprise to me.  Growing up as a GC, everything seemed oddly easy and living in a sense.  But not experiencing all avenues of life really messed up who I should've been today.  Growing up, I was showered with gifts and faux-love *constantly* by Nmom (given that I get good grades, but that's a story for another time).  I was always the apple of her eye and my little brother trailed behind me, receiving the brunt of her wrath.  She always bragged about my excellent grades, my neatness, anything she wanted to her coworkers and family.  And yet here I was, not even able to lift a finger without her watchful eye protecting me.  Choices were made on my behalf
I	anymore.	I have no job, I live with my parents who wish I was my brother (who is perfect according to them), and the country I live in is falling to fucking shambles.  Peace out y'all, finding out what comes after existence is all I'm excited for anymore.  
Hey	life	Hey does anyone else fart constantly and get stomach pains when they're nervous and what did you do about it? This problem is ruining my life
I have always downplayed my suicidal thoughts at therapy	I have never made any plans to end my life	So Im depressed, my depression is kind of the overarching issue with the others tending to loop me back into a depressed state.  I dont know what I am doing with my life.  My options are extremely limited.  my depression makes it hard to concentrate, and learn, and negative thoughts constantly belittle my efforts.  I havent gone anywhere, there is no precedent for me succeeding, only for continued everlasting failure.  I dont see a way forward, no way for things to get better, I have mild panic attacks throughout the day, wake up in the mddle of the night worrying about finances, health and thats if I can get to sleep I want to kill myself.   <e1> I have always downplayed my suicidal thoughts at therapy </e1>  because  <e2> I have never made any plans to end my life </e2> .  Thats a really thin line though and I am resourceful.  Having these thoughts day in day out is so tiring, I am tapped, I just want it to end. I would like any advice people have, really just chatting and having the chance to be honest would help
And	.	And I'm so fucking disappointed in myself.  I made it through most of my son's party on the 3rd.  Carried out my sober plan while there, took my iced tea, saw all the friends and relatives, even left early when I could feel myself getting jealous.  I was jealous they could all drink and have fun with it instead of being consumed by the drinking like I get.  I was jealous of them and angry at myself.  I left that party and went straight to the store.  My husband was working.  Yesterday I came clean to him and our adult sons.  The boys are sad but not mad.  The Husband is a different story. . .  He's just so angry at me.  I am being appropriately punished with his silent treatment.  I can endure.  All of you who have supported me, I am so sorry I'm not tougher than this thing.  This is hard, so very hard and tiring.  I feel so defeated by alcohol, But I know I cannot let it win.  I will not.  So here we go again.  I have already requested a badge reset.  As I sit here in tears at 0700. . . 
8	IT!	8 years ago today I woke up with a raging hangover and a heart full of regrets.  This morning I woke up a bit stuffy from all of the fireworks smoke and a heart full of gratitude! I'm so happy that I took my life back from the control of alcohol and can live it on my own terms.               Here's hoping for one more day of sobriety.  If you are visiting this sub and considering quitting, YOU CAN DO IT! 
With	Thanks	With anger issue, I find myself go from 0-1000 so fast, it could be a simple thing that just infuriates me and my adrenaline kicks and I feel flustered and ready to attack at a moments notice, just so fast to switch to high adrenaline mode I am bp2 but looking at bpd as sysmtons seem close, anyone else have anger that switches on like that? Is that normal bpd signs ? Thanks
I guess i'm a highly inhibited	most people with SA can be	I've been aware of evidence linking anxiety with low T for years.  I've always been tempted to experiment, but i've always been too scared.   <e1> I guess i'm a highly inhibited </e1>  as  <e2> most people with SA can be </e2> .  Normal people don't worry so much about the potential downside of things!Recently someone told me a story about a friend of theirs who's life and SA improved dramatically after taking testosterone. I'm wondering if anyone here has looked into this? Had their blood levels checked? Or even actually EXPERIMENTED with injecting? (obviously i'm talking to the men :))I'm super tempted
Yesterday	am.	Yesterday I was heading for another downward spiral and brought up again to my husband how depressed I was feeling and cried for a while.  He's been concerned since I first told him how I was feeling but this is the first time he's actually cried from it.  He thought that I was getting better and when he realized I wasn't he broke down.  To be honest I was feeling a bit better the passed week or so.  I hated seeing him cry, but it also made me feel really good seeing how much I meant to him.  He tells me all the time how much he loves me but seeing him break down over me feeling depressed and hopeless really made it sink in that I'm not alone and that he really is concerned and scared for me as much as I am. 
Hi	time?	Hi there, I could use some emotional support.  Being single is pretty tough for me, and I've done a lot of work around it but I think when my anxiety gets higher it's something I have a lot of shame and sadness around.  I'm in the little friend group and it feels like everyone is pairing up around me.  It makes me intensely sad and I wind up feeling different/less than/alone when I'm in this group and people are breaking up into couples.  Any words of advice? I'm trying mindfulness, trying to seek out dating on my own (I've been single for quite a while now since my last relationship) but I'm worried I will keep feeling more and more activated when in this group.  How do I balance not isolating in order to feel ok (but feeling worse because I'm isolating myself) and not just sitting it out and feeling really lonely during friend time?
Been	it.	Been an all day everyday smoker for around 2 years, and I'm finally noticing that if I don't want to smoke, all I have to do is get out of bed and do SOMETHING.  anything.  A brain that is bored is a brain that wants to be high.  So now I spend every moment I can justify at the pool hall just practicing, most times 20-30 hours a week.  I don't know if it's healthy to switch addictions like I do, but right now this is what works for me and I feel like that's all that should matter.  I'm working towards a goal, even if it might be damn near impossible, the grind is worth it.  
Hi	to.	Hi everyone, I've been smoking heroin for probably the past month and a half to 2 months, but I've had a problem with opiates and heroin since around 2010.  I'm 27 now and currently still fighting my addiction.  Its only day 2 and I've pretty much gotten over the physical withdrawal symptoms other than my back pains, thanks to loperimide.  What I'm having trouble dealing with are the mental side effects, the cravings, the wanting to do it.  I guess I'm just looking for mental support.  I really don't want to mess up in my detox but I'm afraid I'm going to. 
I am definitely a party person	every once in a while I mess up and drink too much	I am usually a pretty smart drinker, but I'm in university and  <e1> I am definitely a party person </e1> , so obviously  <e2> every once in a while I mess up and drink too much </e2> .  Anyway, a few days ago I got blacked out at a party and my previously tame OCD lashed out at me.  I have felt extremely anxious all day today and yesterday about if I did something like fall or hit my head heard when I was blacked out.  I understand it's very stupid to black out, and trust me I don't enjoy doing it, but it happens.  Obviously I will try my best in the future to not do that.  Anyway, just wondering if anybody can relate.  
I'm	Thanks!	I'm looking to give meditation a try.   I'd like to calm my chattery brain and hope to have better control over my impulsive emotions and thoughts.   Anyone have any success stories? Or perhaps some suggestions / links on how I should get started?  I've never attempted. Thanks!
I	anyone.	I placed a bag over my head and tightened it with a rubber band but panicked and couldn't do it in the end.  I still want to kill myself  but I just can't pull myself to talk to anyone. 
And that I stopped taking my adhd medicine	trying to conceive (baby/getting pregnant) doesn't help either	Today I feel so overwhelmed.  I hate how when I get a task done, it's never done: I have to do it again in a week/month etc.  For example, I have unpaid bills and everytime I pay them (and get proud for doing that), there are new bills coming in. . .  Or I call the physiotherapist to make an appointment (proud at myself again for not waiting a month) turns out they need information from my insurance, which means I have to go and call the insurer. . .  and I hate making calls. I promised people to call them and I forget, I am forgetting tasks I was supposed to fulfil for my volunteer work, and all of this gets my mind so busy with worrying about letting people down.  Shame and guilt.  Ah it makes me so tired.  <e1> And that I stopped taking my adhd medicine </e1>  because  <e2> trying to conceive (baby/getting pregnant) doesn't help either </e2> . 
So	myself!!!	So in order to graduate I have to teach this class I've been observing for the past few weeks.  Now I've been talking with my therapist about this for the past month but I can't bring myself to calm down!!! I am so afraid of embarrassing myself and stuttering and making a fool out of myself! This will also be graded.  Please help me not to be very hard on myself!!!
I'm just sick of being that guy to cancel plans/call off days at work	I have an anxiety about being sick	Hello all, I come here to ask about some advice for whatever I have.  It's difficult to explain.  Basically, I always seem to have anxiety about being sick/throwing up.  I don't actually fear vomiting, it just seems like my mind convinces my body that I'm sick when I'm actually not.  For example, I took a road trip down to Iowa with my family for a wedding, and for about 2 hours of the car ride I was having an attack of somesort, feeling like I was sick.  I couldn't speak at all.  I swear I could feel my stomach churning.  I was breathing very heavily.  That isn't the only time that's happened, and it hasn't happened until recently.  I used to regularly take 8+ hour bus rides/trips just fine until about a year ago.  I guess  <e1> I'm just sick of being that guy to cancel plans/call off days at work </e1>  just because  <e2> I have an anxiety about being sick </e2> .  Does anyone else feel like this? And are there any tips on how to calm yourself down?
They	is	They don't know how many times I stammer and stutter when talking to everyday people, or how I panic and am only able to nod when someone initiates small talk.  I get terrified before any event that I agreed to.  I feel relieved after I finish talking to someone and it went well.  It takes me 5 minutes to build up the courage to get up and throw something in the trash can that's only 5 feet away.  I sit outside the circle trying to get myself to talk and then they change the subject. . . I'm even feeling nervous right now, posting this anonymous post on a forum dedicated for it. I love my friends, and I know they mean well, but sometimes I wish that they knew how it really is
Basically I just locked myself out of my vehicle and it wasn't even a problem	I had a spare key stashed away in my wallet	 <e1> Basically I just locked myself out of my vehicle and it wasn't even a problem </e1>  because  <e2> I had a spare key stashed away in my wallet </e2> .   the point is that if we know that we have set an attentional lapses which happen over and over again we can come up with simple fixes that allow us to compensate around them.   By doing this simple key thing I avoided having to call and wait for and be embarrassed in front of a locksmith. 
I	.	I notice when I am more depressed my eyes are more dry than usual.  And when I am happier and talkative and active, and have days where I am feeling better all around, my eyes aren't dry.  Does this happen to anyone else? Or am I being stupid. . 
I'm	it?	I'm particularly curious if your dpdr got better or worse from it?
I went to a facility today and was officially diagnosed with ADHD-combined	I show some symptoms in each of the 3 categories	So my whole life [22F] I've been extremely forgetful and distractable, to the point of ridiculousness.  My mom has suspected ADD/ADHD for a long time but I just now got the drive to actually get tested.   <e1> I went to a facility today and was officially diagnosed with ADHD-combined </e1>  since  <e2> I show some symptoms in each of the 3 categories </e2> .  The Dr.  prescribed 20mg Vyvanse with a 3 week follow up.  It's strange. . .  I'm glad for the confirmation and to start seeing if the Vyvanse will help me day to day with school and work but it's also a little unsettling to get the diagnosis, if that makes sense? It's one thing to self diagnose and assume oh this is probably why but to have an actual medical confirmation isn't sitting 100% right with me.  Did anyone else feel like that at first?
I am afraid to go back on prescription meds for it	those are addictive too and they trigger me to smoke weed/cigs and other reasons	Does anyone have a problem with replacing their drug/alcohol addiction with another addiction?? I've managed to be sober lately but I've gone back to playing league of legends all day when I should be doing other things. . .  I don't have that much going on until college starts back up in the fall. .  I was going to work as a parking attendant at a festival to earn some cash for a week. .   at least I can manage my video game addiction I guess, but I still feel bad about it. . .  I just have an addictive personality. .  I was diagnosed with ADD in 2011 but  <e1> I am afraid to go back on prescription meds for it </e1>  because  <e2> those are addictive too and they trigger me to smoke weed/cigs and other reasons </e2>  . . . thoughts? 
does	ugly	does anyone else get jealous over relationships they're not a part of or other people getting attention or just anything that you really shouldn't be jealous of?? i feel so ugly 
Half	turkey.	Half the reason we have this badge system is so we can give advice and relate to people knowing where they are at during their quit.  Sometimes people with 60 days on their badge talk about their intense nicotine cravings as they quit NRT, and we give advice to them as if they had quit cold turkey. 
my disorder	this has caused me a great deal of emotional distress and im having a difficult time going about my day	one of my very good friends is angry with me over something i said or did at his 4th of july party.  he won't tell me what it was and its ruined my whole day trying to figure out what it was.  he's currently ignoring me.  naturally because of  <e1> my disorder </e1>   <e2> this has caused me a great deal of emotional distress and im having a difficult time going about my day </e2>  and having self destructive thoughts.  any advice would be welcome.  
On	schedule?	On certain nights like tonight (12:30AM), I experience hyperfocus and start to be very productive on a project. Problem is, these moments are relatively rare, so I feel compelled to seize the opportunity and work.  In this state, I can work well into noon the next day and get a lot done. During the day, I have trouble being productive.  I feel like I don't reach my potential.  I only realize what my potential could be when I'm in a state like this. I also have a lot of trouble keeping a good sleep schedule. I was diagnosed earlier this year.  For now, I have decided not to take medication.  I was prescribed and tried Adderall and it brought about a constant anxiety, and I'm not ready to try another. TL;DR: take advantage of hyperfocus that only happens at night at the cost of never being able to keep a good sleep schedule?
Cliched	today	Cliched quote I know but I doesn't make it any less true.  If you haven't already.  Smash your bong/ pipes.  Flush whatever weed you have down the toilet.  You straight up have no need for it anymore, weed used to be fun, but it's not anymore.  You and I both know it's true. Your brain will take awhile to get back to normal but if you don't stop smoking today
Sort	Again	Sort of new new to this sub.  I read the rules and I think I'm ok with formatting and with what I wanna talk about. I've always had anxiety, but not as severe as it's been these past couple of weeks.  I smoke marijuana.  It keeps me distracted from my problems and responsibilities.  I unfortunately still live with my parents.  They found my wax.  Cue the anxiety build up. This is where things get tricky.  With being a full time student and full time worker, I'm always stressed out.  I'm a car guy too, which is a double edged sword in itself too.  If something's wrong with my car, I get even more anxious.  Now that my parents found my stash, it's just more added to the pile. I like this girl from work.  She's cute and a blast to hang out with.  She smokes with me too.  I tell her my problems and she tells me hers.  She's great.  Well now we throw a girl into the anxiety mix.  I haven't dated since high school! I don't know what I'm doing! We've gone on a couple of dates or maybe those are just friendly dates? Again
This	body	This is my second cold turkey approach, the first time I only got halfway through day 2 before breaking down for a smoke.  My Smoke Free app says the nicotine is officially out of my body
Sometimes,	helps	Sometimes, I wake up in the morning feeling awesome and I'm happy, then something minor happens(asked my bf to grab me cereal that I left in the car and he didn't) and I'm so irrationally angry that I cry and hit things, often injuring myself.  Or I get so depressed I go into a vegetative/dissociative state for hours.  In that depressed state, the only thing that makes sense to me is hurting myself.  In my angry state, I want to hurt other people.  I usually need to smoke weed to calm down or Just wait it out.  Anyone have any other coping mechanisms? Anything helps 
I	anyone.	I started smoking exactly 1 year ago.  And I said that I would smoke for a year to see how hard it can be to quit. Bad idea, I know.  But I am a very curious person and wanted to experience this myself before having an opinion about it. I was wrong, smoking is very addicting.  I enjoyed it though.  But now I have to quit. Today was my last cigarette.  3 hours ago.  Now I wil never ever do this shit again.  Good luck to anyone. 
I	it.	I used to brush my teeth and use mouthwash in the morning before I left for work, and I thought my breath smelled fine.   I was so mortified to have someone tell me my breath smelled like a still, the morning after getting soused and giving my mouth a good cleaning.   I found out my co-workers had a field day behind my back discussing it and I hate them for it.   I still cringe when I think about it.   
Badge	AGAIN	Badge reset :( I messed up and drank beers last night.  I was so excited to get to two weeks and I was almost there! Well, I am not giving up on myself- so here's to day 1- AGAIN
I'm	helps?	I'm in one of those moods where I just need to do something impulsive and I've already bought a $ 200 camera I neither need nor want, shaved half my head, dyed my hair blue, quit my job, and OD'd on pills twice so at this point I don't even know what else to do, but I need to do something, if that makes sense.  Any ideas? Does anyone else ever feel like this? What helps?
u/	change?	u/ freedomhamburger posted here earlier today about dreaming to open an all ADHD university.  I like the idea. And it had me thinking, if such a university (or high school) existed, what would you want from it? What irks you most about formal education and what would you like to change?
I don't want to think about my future	I feel it will be nothing at the end of the day	I live in the UK and I'm all alone and I've been fighting off the urge to kill myself! I've been hopeless and  <e1> I don't want to think about my future </e1>  as  <e2> I feel it will be nothing at the end of the day </e2> ! I've never lived the life that I wanted too, I've never been in relationship even though I've always wanted too, but I'm too ugly and my dreams will not come true! Please help me!
I'm so turned off by this world	I'm just shutting down	I've felt so bad for so long.  I've been trying to push myself to find a gf and a new job to new avail.   <e1> I'm so turned off by this world </e1>  that  <e2> I'm just shutting down </e2> .  I can't put up with work and the loneliness.  I've wanted to kill myself for so long.  With the recent round of job and female rejection, I really desire to just kill myself.  I know someday it will get better but the thought of another lonely weekend is enough to drive me to suicide.  It just is all way too much.  I've been up happy for so long but I haven't had the nerve to just off myself. I've had my gun out in the open for a few days now.  I look at it and sometimes hold it to my head to see how it feels.  Suicide is something I want now.  Just thinking about it brings me great relief.  
Going	anxious?Thanks!	Going abroad for the first time in my life, I'm not too worried about that, I'm more worried about flying for the first time. Take off, landing, turbulence and banking are what kinda freaks me out right now.  I don't want to have a panic attack on the plane - although I've never really had one.  And I don't want that falling feeling you get on rollercoasters.  And I'm not too keen on that sinking feeling in your stomach. Any tips on how I can calm down and not be so nervous and anxious?Thanks!
And the inevitable hangover in the morning	I know myself	I almost drank, even invited some people over let them know I was going to set a limit and everything would be all good.  But then I started thinking about my nightly routine that I've started since I quit drinking, of yoga, mediation and cleaning up my apartment, and how I probably wouldn't get that done, or it would be very sloppy.  The feeling of regret before I'm about to fall asleep and in the morning.   <e1> And the inevitable hangover in the morning </e1>  because  <e2> I know myself </e2> , I won't stop at my limit.  That's part of the reason I quit drinking in the first place.  I'm a bit depressed now, I had kind of amped myself up with the thought of having a drink with friends and that feeling of no worries.  I don't know, I guess I just needed a place to let that out.  Thank you all for being here.  I won't drink with you tonight.   
Went to an ADHD specialist	I was sure that's why I couldn't get anything accomplished	 <e1> Went to an ADHD specialist </e1>  because  <e2> I was sure that's why I couldn't get anything accomplished </e2> .  I talked with him and then took a QB test to make sure.  Turns out I'm ADHD-C but he said that I'm not impulsive at all which makes sense, I've always had manners and been cautious.  I'm starting Vyvanse tomorrow and hopefully I'll start to notice a change.  I'm excited to get started working towards organizing my life and trying to stay on track!Did anyone have inattention as a kid and then develop the hyperactive part later in life?Also does anyone have any tips on getting started with organizing my life? I've researched a lot of strategies but don't know where to start. 
my	him.	my ex boyfriend and best friend killed himself last week and all i can possibly think about is killing myself to be with him.  i am still in love with him and afraid no one will ever love me the way he did.  i don't want to live without him.  
Biting	gross.	Biting my nails isn't a big deal, but i've been biting my fingers for many years now.  My fingers are ruined by scabs and callouses and I'm very self conscious about them (I usually have my hands folded or in pockets).  Sometimes when I'm feeling extremely anxious, I bite them until they bleed and I have to put bandaids on them.  I'm afraid a cut will get infected or something if I keep this up.  How can I stop myself from biting my fingers? Thank you and I apologize if this is gross. 
I've	fatty	I've never burned my house down.  I have almost burned my house down on numerous occasions.  You see, I like to cook.  Good food.  Lots of braising.  Lots of reductions.  Lots of sauces.  High calorie, very tasty fare.  The problem arises when I decide to have a drink before cooking.  I, like so many of you glorious people on this sub, can't have just a couple of drinks.  It has to be complete abstinence, or I will drink everything in sight, until my BAC is at near-lethal levels.  There is NO middle ground.  I am not in control as soon as I take a sip. Passing out, into an unwakable drunken coma does not bode well with cooking fatty
I'm consuming waaaaay less calories and spending so much less money than when I was drinking	don't feel guilty getting popcorn or an ice-cream	I found Fridays the hardest in terms of alcohol cravings and resisting drinking.  I'm always tired and stressed and want to cut loose and forget my week.  For years the only way I knew how to cope was by drinking heavily on Fridays.  But since I've joined SD and become sober, I've found a much better alternative: Friday nights at the cinema.  I head out for dinner, then go to the movies, and it's much better than drinking booze! <e1> I'm consuming waaaaay less calories and spending so much less money than when I was drinking </e1> , so  <e2> don't feel guilty getting popcorn or an ice-cream </e2> .  To me, it's a healthy escape for a few hours and a good non-alcohol related thing I look forward to.  It's cheaper than going out, and I feel amazing on Saturday morning, refreshed and ready to start my fun, non-hungover weekend.  I highly recommend it. Thanks for the support SD! And thanks for not drinking with me today.  
I	years	I have this notebook where I write down quotes or sayings that I want to remember from various sources to help with my recovery.  I recently shared some things with a friend who told me she is suffering with anxiety.  One of the things I said was, Being anxious and unhappy is not your personality.  It's a skill that you have practiced for years
Five	diagnosis	Five weeks ago, I killed Prufrock, my pet fish. Little backstory: I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 16 but somehow, I feel like I've been misdiagnosed.  Yes, I rarely did something productive during those times but I also wasn't feeling that sad or empty, which most depressives tend to feel.  I feel like I was just so angry at everything that it completely shut me down.  To cope with this inexplicable anger, I often cried, punched the wall, and/or scratched myself until I bled.  Sometimes, on good days, I just tried to rationalize the situation I'm in and reduced the anger to mere irritability and it somehow worked. So anyway upon my diagnosis
I don't know what real suffering is	I should have no right to feel that way	I have problems talking to people and am not in a happy place right now, but there are people trying to escape a warzone right now or straving in africa who trade problems with me in a second and feel like  <e1> I don't know what real suffering is </e1>  so  <e2> I should have no right to feel that way </e2>  and should probably just learn to be happy with what I have, but still just can't.  lonliness sucks
I	greif.	I know that the eclipse is a totally normal, completely natural thing that happens all the time.  But I can't help feeling uneasy about the whole affair.  Does anyone else feel this way as well? I blame it on how we like to assign meaning to celestial events.  And with recent years liking to claim it's the end of the world, naturally this irrational fear is causing me greif. 
I'm	dream.	I'm 18 and going into college this fall.  My passion is writing but my anxiety has always prevented me from sharing my writing.  I only share my writing with the encouragement of my 11th grade English teacher, she's the sweetest lady there is.  She gave me an application to a competitive writing internship and I had to do a phone interview yesterday.  I was really nervous during the interview and stuttered alot.  But the guy told me that I gave a good answer that he hadn't heard before.  After worrying about it all night, they let me know that out of the final 10 people, (the application had 3 rounds) I was one of the 2 people chosen to work for the organization for the summer.  Super proud of myself (first time being proud of myself) and it feels good.  I feel like I finally got my foot in the door to become an author which is my dream. 
We live in different cities	i have to travel to go there	she has BPD, even after a wonderful day the next day she is sad, feeling empty and suicidal ( <e1> We live in different cities </e1>  soo  <e2> i have to travel to go there </e2> ). What is the best way to talk about her problems, best approach?
I'm glad he did	it gives me the extra impetus that I need	I have been lurking on here for a while now but have not actually tried to stop drinking.  My husband told me yesterday that he wants me to stop drinking and  <e1> I'm glad he did </e1>  because  <e2> it gives me the extra impetus that I need </e2> .  I am 45 and I can't carry on like this.  My lovely husband and my precious children deserve better.  I am so glad to have found this place for support.  Can anyone tell me how to get a badge? I don't have a sidebar on my iPhone app.  Thanks.  
I	stupid	I care about you! You matter! You're loved! I love you!It's so condescending.  Do you think the suicidal person is stupid

My body shakes, my heart pounds so hard and I can barely catch my breath.  I can't wait to escape from this place but I have 8 more hours to go.  I try not to make any eye contact with anyone.

Unless	through?	Unless it's boring I suppose but then I understand.  do you guys just legitimately start reading interesting articles and get bored halfway through?
Hey	horrible.	Hey guys,Is anyone taking antidepressants, which and for how long? Did you have a break or quit them and how did you feel?I was on Etalopro for a few years, felt a lot better, but now I decided to wean off and I'm back to my old cranky, sad self.  Any advice? I really don't want to take them for the rest of my miserable life, but when I'm not on them, I feel horrible. 
the dynamic of going NC is different	I feel as if I'm abandoning a weak old woman in her old age and craziness	Why aren't there any resources for sons or the men in the family who have gone no contact?All of the stories I am reading are by daughters who have cut off contact but nothing for sons.  The reason I ask is that at least for me the men in the family are the providers and the ones who take care of the elders and women.  Hence  <e1> the dynamic of going NC is different </e1>  because  <e2> I feel as if I'm abandoning a weak old woman in her old age and craziness </e2>  and have not fulfilled my duty as a son or a man.  Anyone else here feel this way? How do you cope? I can't afford a therapist right now and need guidance please.  
my low verbal/spatial WM usually gets in the way of learning/problem solving	I can only hold two concepts in my head @ once	How do you guys with low working memory learn abstract concepts?I feel like I learn by using raw intuition,  <e1> my low verbal/spatial WM usually gets in the way of learning/problem solving </e1>  since  <e2> I can only hold two concepts in my head @ once </e2> . . . if I could shut it off completely, I'd probably have an easier time learning.  Have any of you improved via meditation/dnb/stimulants/intuniv, etc? Could meditating to the point of virtually turning off working memory benefit people like me? 
It	flawed	It makes no sense to me that I can't help myself. I had strong communication skills, I was able to share my feelings but ever since my diagnosis I've retracted from all social interactions.  I feel like I have nothing worthwhile to share; now more than ever given I've lost interest in anything I used to enjoy.  I don't recognize who I am nor do I like myself, and no matter how much I try to change little bits of myself to try and be happy about myself, and what I do - I can't.  I am a performing, smart, good looking person who can't get over the fact that my perspective is stuck to you have a flawed brain.  You are flawed
I've	advance	I've been having a really hard time not stopping at the store on my way hime from work.  I'm sick of waking up feeling like shit.  I thought about going to meetings but, I think I'm kinda afraid to.  So this is me asking for help.  Any advice would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance
Always hated my writing the next day	all my favorite writers were at first displeased with their work	Hello r/stopdrinking. I just joined r/stopdrinking today, I have been sober for 13 days.   My favorite writers are drunks, Hemingway Hunter Scott Thompson, Dostoevsky etc.   I used to try to emulate these men, drinking heavily and writing in a melancholy overly-romantic tone.    <e1> Always hated my writing the next day </e1> , believing that  <e2> all my favorite writers were at first displeased with their work </e2> .   I kept drinking and writing and have a stockpile of drunken rambling.   Some pieces are ok, most need a lot of improving. I wrote again recently sober, and for the the first time in a long time, I'm very pleased with what I am able to get on paper. Trying to live and write like Hemingway or Thompson is cute.  But it is no way write, and certainly no way to live.   I need to remind myself that while I admire the literature of these tormented men, I should remember their lifestyles were hellish and not be imitated. Keep sober, keep writing. Thank you /r/stopdrinking. 
I've	be.	I've never been diagnosed with OCD but over the past year and a half I've seen the person I used to be and the shameful things that I did and no matter what I do and no matter how much I dwell.  I can't let go of my shame/guilt, I understand that I have no one to blame but myself but I just can't accept that I did these things and there are no repercussions. On one hand I feel like I deserve the judgement/hatred for the things I did and on the other I'm too worried about what people will think of me if they ever find out.  I've worked so hard to improve myself and I have people in my life who I've befriended and they look at me differently than I look at myself and if anyone ever speaks positively about me, I just automatically go straight to thinking about the horrible person I used to be. 
I haven't ever been able to make it even two weeks without having to miss at least one class since sophomore year of high school	I'm very proud of myself and my progress	I just finished my first module of classes for the summer, which lasted 4 weeks.  I made it to every single one of my classes for the whole four weeks!  <e1> I haven't ever been able to make it even two weeks without having to miss at least one class since sophomore year of high school </e1> , so  <e2> I'm very proud of myself and my progress </e2> .  I know 4 weeks is not a lot but it's still a huge step in the right direction.  
Everything	die	Everything has just become too much I can feel myself shutting down and I feel bad for my family and my boyfriend but the pain is so overwhelmingly unbearable I don't know what else to do I know this pain won't stop it'll ease and get worse again and I can't take it.  I need to die 
I	abuse.	I was at a low point in my life my junior year of high school and a narcissist came in to save me and I became addicted to her. I felt like if I lost that friendship I would literally die. Like i more or less had to be with her all the time. I even began to question if I was romantically interested in her before realizing that she was the first person that ever showed me attention and I was also in some way addicted to the psychological abuse. 
In	him	In about an hourish my husband and I will be headed to the doctor.  For a few years now I've been on the receiving end of some crazy freakouts (for lack of a better word).  It's not the typical abusive relationship type of stuff; he rarely hits me.  But he does.  And when it happens he sees me crying or scared and seems to snap out of it and asks me what he did and shows absolute genuine remorse.  A concerned friend of ours stepped in recently and talked some things out between us including the physical disputes and more personal things that has been confided in him
So,	me	So, today I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist.  I'm not gunna lie, I am beyond terrified.  I've never thought I would sit down and open up to a complete stranger.  Hopefully it goes over well for me
I	regimen.	I screwed up last night.  Had some personal issues and was upset and took an extra 8 g outside of my taper amount late in the evening.  I would have been at only 15. 5 g yesterday otherwise.  I'm trying not to beat myself up about it or think too much about the issue that I let get to me last night.  I dosed this morning and I'm attempting to see how long I can go without since I'm off work today.  I haven't been more than five or six hours without in months-since I started, really, so I'm not really sure what to expect.  I've no plans to go completely CT, just to see how far I can make it through the day, and then I will keep my dose low and continue on with my taper regimen.  
So	fired.	So apparently I have a really bad case of BPD.  Saw an ex and we had fun until something just really flipped some kind of switch and next thing I know I am holding her loaded pistol to my head.  So I dunno if I feel guilty or anything about it(well, I guess so, but yeah), or just really sad and stuff. I decided I would try to get help at some point so that doesn't happen again.  I just feel really lost and useless.  Like yeah, probably should have fired.  
does	share.	does anyone here have general experience with nootropics, or more specific experience with them to combat WD or PAWS?Piracetam is a common one that is supposed to help with concentration and mood.   That seems like a possible winner for PAWS, when motivation, and focus seem to be in the shitter. I also read a bit about a uridine/choline/fish oil stack that is very effective, and can help rebuild the dopamine sectors of the brain. I'm wary of said claims, but am still curious if anyone has useful anecdotes they could share. 
I usually listen to podcasts	it's gotta be pretty intense to keep my attention enough	When I'm at work and need something to distract myself or keep my mind busy,  <e1> I usually listen to podcasts </e1> .  The thing being,  <e2> it's gotta be pretty intense to keep my attention enough </e2> .  If I can't find something that's interesting, I usually end up listening to things that are scary (like the No Sleep podcast or other scary story things).  I'm a big scaredy cat, and often times it overrules the anxiety, weird I know.  Obviously I'd rather be distracted by something cool or interesting rather than something that scares the pants off of me when I'm laying in bed later remembering all the details.  Any suggestions?
I have 3-4 coffees a day	I actually have way too much energy almost	So here's something I didn't expect as a factor at all when quitting I didn't even consider it.  Usually  <e1> I have 3-4 coffees a day </e1> , since quitting  <e2> I actually have way too much energy almost </e2> , today I only had two coffees and didn't need the second one, or even the first one I think. . . I was bouncing off the walls with energy.  It's been like that for the last two days.  Will this calm down? I feel like its actually too much, Or do I have to give up the one thing that I love. . . coffee?Please say no.  I love coffee so much.  
Like	awful.	Like I could watch something happen or hear someone talk to me and it would literally play back in my mind like a buffering video in slow motion.  It mostly happens from listening to things but sometimes it's like reality is broken down frame by frame and it's awful. 
I	head.	I cant really type it out without getting too upset but the long and short of it is I was waiting for a chance to apply for a specific promotion.  I found out about the opening late last week and thought it would be open until this Friday but it actually closed last Friday.  I want to go home and fucking shoot myself in the fucking head.  
So	today!	So I started my journey mid January of this year, had a relapse in mid April that lasted till the end of may.  I did the math and in 2017 I have been sober approximately 162/192 days.  So 84% of my year has been sober.  Compared to probably a 60-70% rate most years.   I was feeling bad about my relapse and not doing better, but I am so proud of these numbers! I will not drink with you today! 
Why	hey	Why do I let the same person bring me down time and again?  When we argue I feel like dying.   Literally feel like dying.   I feel like he would be so much happier without me but the stubborn part of me also says, hey
I	sucks.	I have had bad expiriences with counselors, thus whole NC is really hard.  My brother has been blowing up my phone but i havnt answered and i have not responded.  This is so hard, my husband doesnt get it and i have no one to talk to.  I feel like im climbing a cliff with no rope.  I need someone to call when i feel guilty and want to break NC.  This definatly sucks.  
LONG------	me	LONG------ TL;DR: at the bottom! My current situation: Nmom and Edad have been arguing for weeks about something and my sister[24f]  and I[28f] have been doing our best to be neutral in the whole thing.  The most we have done is give our personal advice on how to handle the situation without taking sides.  Nmom is not satisfied with this.  She has the mentality If you are not with me
and	Also	 and I can't find anything and I get too overwhelmed to clean it up.  Also
Feeling	now.	Feeling really down right now.  This might be a weird request, but I'd love to hear some good news from you guys.  Progress, success, anything.  I could really use a streak of hope right now. 
Possibly well intentioned	she was worried about my safety	I'm very good at attracting abrasive people, or bring it out in otherwise well behaved individuals.  Today she kinda got pissed about the place I'm looking at for housing, and just said hat's fucking stupid.   <e1> Possibly well intentioned </e1>  because  <e2> she was worried about my safety </e2>  but yooo. . .  stop stepping on my timidness lady. 
Social	cold	Social Media and Smart Phones.  Stupid addicting websites like Reddit and 4chan.  Drugs and alcohol.  Sugary junk food.  Garbage shows and advertisements on TV.  All the cars, watches, and worthless knick-knacks.  All the money.  Sex and masturbation.  The parties.  Fuck it, even all the shallow friends that you waste your time with. . . It's all bullshit to me now.  So cold
I must have acquired a contagious decease along the way	the people I used to know no longer seem to care	They want you to be happy and easy going.  When you're sad they will forget you exist.  And if you choose to end your life they will call you selfish, yet they never made the effort to reach out to you when you were in need of some simple conversation and company.   <e1> I must have acquired a contagious decease along the way </e1> , because  <e2> the people I used to know no longer seem to care </e2> , but I can't blame them; they have their own lives and their own problems.  Let the unfortunate ones slowly wither away.  Survival of the fittest, right? I won't back down, even if it means I have to do this alone.  
i'm terribly afraid i'm gonna have a heart attack	the lack of sleep	Have health anxiety for 5 years.  Always afraid of a heart attack.  Random physical symptoms, like left hand numb, dull chest pain, huge back pain and difficulty breathing always present.  Last night had a really hard time falling asleep, and had to resort to a sleeping pill after 3 hours of failing.  Barely got 3 hours of sleep and  <e1> i'm terribly afraid i'm gonna have a heart attack </e1>  because of  <e2> the lack of sleep </e2> , already feeling panicky, and the day just started.  Work is gonna be a chore.  I'm 25 yo, and my doctor said i'm fine after some heart and gastro intestinal checks.  I really don't know how to calm down, now, at work.  TL;DR : slept too little, afraid of having a heart attack due to that.  Any way you guys cope with this ? Any tips? Anything ? Thank you. 
I'm feeling very down	I quit	 <e1> I'm feeling very down </e1>  since  <e2> I quit </e2> .  It's only Day 2, but I'm so freaking tired and feel a bit hopeless this morning.  I realize it's all part of the process and was wondering if anyone had any suggestions to alleviate the depression I feel.  Can you recommend any foods, vitamins, supplements?Thanks!
I was diagnosed in January	I take my meds pretty regularly and go to therapy every two weeks	 <e1> I was diagnosed in January </e1> .  Since then  <e2> I take my meds pretty regularly and go to therapy every two weeks </e2>  (it was weekly until my therapist and I agreed to go to every two weeks this morning).  I hardly ever have any suicidal thoughts. . . like maybe once a week or so.  No urge to self harm.  I have plans for the future.  I have less impulsivity and no urge for substance abuse (Im actually turned off alcohol except for a few social settings. . like the 4th of July was the only time in two months).  I no longer have a FP.  Don't feel like people are abandoning me.  Im still a bit emotional but less so than before.  I feel good about life.  Maybe this is a small form of mania or something but Im enjoying it.  
This	judged.	This is hard for me to admit, but I think I might be an alcoholic and I'm not even 21 yet.  I have been drinking since I was a freshman in high school, but it started out as binge drinking.  Now I drink constantly, probably almost daily.  I deal with most emotions by drinking, and I keep saying I'm going to stop and I can't stop.  I'm starting to feel it weighing down my body and soul.  I feel Iike I need to seek help but I feel like I'll be getting judged.  
The abandonment issues and reactionary control and jealousy issues	wrecked the relationships I've had in the past	So I was recently treated for anxiety and after feeling extreme depression which my meds weren't helping, I returned to my therapist and we came to the conclusion that it was just a symptom of BPD.   <e1> The abandonment issues and reactionary control and jealousy issues </e1>  have utterly  <e2> wrecked the relationships I've had in the past </e2>  and I'm currently stumbling poorly through trying to rebuild with my boyfriend of 8 years.  He knows I'm getting help and does love and care about me.  Officially, we're on pause until I can stop being so controlling and emotionally abusive, and I genuinely was.  I don't want to be this way anymore and I hate myself.  I've been miserable for years and years.  I just feel so lost and don't know where to start. 
told me not to do anything	my kids need me	I just can't take it anymore.  I'm so tired of being me.  So much so that even my ex wife heard it in my voice and  <e1> told me not to do anything </e1>  because  <e2> my kids need me </e2> .   I'm just feeling so angry at myself and I'm not even sure why. . .  I just want to scream and yell and run away.  I need to get out of my body and disappear.  I need to not he awake anymore.  I need to not wake up tomorrow.   I feel so disappointed when I realize I made it through the night.   I don't know what I'm going to do anymore.  I've been in the hospital in the past for this and I don't even want to go, I just want to be done.  I want to get it over with.  
Its super hot in my house	i want to take a super cold shower	My sister has a bunch of friends over constantly and im on edge near them and avoid them as much as possible.  It doesnt help that one time i was in an elevator with them and my sister just blurts out yeah hes really weird around girls haha.   <e1> Its super hot in my house </e1>  and  <e2> i want to take a super cold shower </e2>  but all the towels are gone from the bathroom and if i want a towel i need to go upstairs (where her room is) I feel shitty about myself whenever i havent showered and am all sweaty.  I want to go outside
Not	sober.	Not all lives are worth living.  Drugs make people happy.  If a suicidal person is drinking and smoking weed everyday and they're fine with it, why the fuck should anyone else care? If that's the way they found to make life worth it, why is it a bad thing? Who decided you need to be sober to live a good life?  Just some thoughts I had while pondering alcoholism as a life choice.  I'd really rather be alive and drunk than dead and sober. 
I've	this.	I've been with my bipolar SO for five years now, today it finally hit me that I think we need to be apart in order for us both to be healthy.  Tomorrow I think I need to break up with her.  It literally feels like I'm dying.  I'm so worried she won't be safe during her episodes without me.  I'm so scared to move on without her but I feel like this is the only way.  I'm in college and no one around me really understand how shitty this is.  Feeling lonely and hopeless.  It also kinda feels like I've failed her.  I just want her to be happy and I think this is the only way.  Anxious as hell to tell her tomorrow.   I hate this.   
I feel the pangs of sadness coming back	I dont have weed to null my mind's tendency to wander and realize	I started smoking weed for fun.  Then it offered a happiness I had never gotten from relationships and people.  By relationships, I don't mean romance, I just mean friendship, familly-ship, etc.  Any sort of relationship with another person.  Weed kept me company when I was by any standard, a lonely person.  Now that I've stopped, I'm less depressed.  But  <e1> I feel the pangs of sadness coming back </e1>  because  <e2> I dont have weed to null my mind's tendency to wander and realize </e2>  1) im lonely and 2) i dont know how to start relationships anymore.  Does anyone have advice on how to gradually become better at being a friend and being friendly to people in a less than shallow, less than bullshit fake way?
I	relate?	I finally reached a point in 3 years where I am not depressed and stressed as I once was and I feel good but. .  my OCD has leveled up.  I thought it would've triggered more when I was stressed but I don't know what's causing it at this point.  Anyone can relate? 
I was taking it in morning only	10mg per day was my dose	I am not using Strattera but different brand, it's called Attentra.  I used them few weeks ago but I didn't see any change in me.  I'm very impatient so I stopped taking them.  Now I am thinking of starting them again.  I was wondering if it takes time for it to show positive results.  What's your experience on it? One pill is 10mg only.  And  <e1> I was taking it in morning only </e1> .  So  <e2> 10mg per day was my dose </e2> .  What was yours?
I'm now at the point where I want to stop for a variety of reasons	today is day one of what I'm determined to be my smoke-free life	I've been smoking for the past seven years - managed to stop completely for one of those years - but  <e1> I'm now at the point where I want to stop for a variety of reasons </e1>  (main ones being long term health &amp; the girl I'm seeing), and so  <e2> today is day one of what I'm determined to be my smoke-free life </e2> .  I'm curious to know what other people who have / are in the process of quitting have done to either replace smoking or supplement their lives in its place.  For me, I plan on exercising a lot more regularly, maybe reading too, but I want to know what people have found works for them.  Has anyone tried things like meditation, or found a hobby / interest they never expected to have?
I	it.	I think one of the worst things about anxiety, for me anyway, is apathy as a defense mechanism.  It's adjacent to depression, but not quite.  I'm totally functional and even jovial at times.  I just don't really care about much, or at least I don't feel passionate about things.  Sometimes one of these ruts lasts for just a few days, and sometimes much, much longer.  It's like my brain shuts down all strong feeling as a defense mechanism to curb anxiety.  Anyway, all is well, I was just wondering if other people have experienced the same thing and if so, how you've dealt with it.  
Sometimes	Relate?	Sometimes around ppl i get so anxious i cant move or speak, other times i cant stop talking or moving.  Relate?
having lost much weight due to anorexia	I decided to recover and gained it all back last spring through massive binges	I developed anorexic behaviours very suddenly last year when I was 25 years old.  Before that I was the king of intuitive eating and I managed to successfully maintain my natural set-point weight - which incindentally was at the lowest end of the healthy weight range - without EVER dieting or restricting in ANY way. Again, I was already an adult.  I had already stopped growing.  My weight was already my adult weight. After  <e1> having lost much weight due to anorexia </e1>   <e2> I decided to recover and gained it all back last spring through massive binges </e2>  (which I don't regret at all and don't feel guilty about).  Now I am back to my previous weight since March. I really, truly, so much hoped and expected that when I did hit my former weight my urges to eat more than the normal amounts of food would subside and eventually fade.  It didn't happen at first
Maybe	edge.	Maybe its something similar to imposter syndrome? I'm not sure why I feel this way.  Every time I'm at work I spend the day anxiously thinking that I'm clumsy and oafish and that I can't do my job as well as any of my coworkers.  I feel like the days are just counting down until they've had enough of me and fire me. Maybe similarly, whenever I have a relationship I feel like their friends and family hate me.  I just want to feel welcome and like I belong but I'm always anxious and on edge. 
Fuck	shit.	Fuck you brain I hate you.  Why do you make me have to be sad all day long.  Why do you make me have to break down crying half way through work.  Why do you have to make me feel retarded when I talk to people.  I fucking hate you, you piece of shit. 
my legal guardians are not helping	my mom only comforts me by having the usual my little angel is on the honor roll attitude	It's that time of year again! I wasted my entire month of July on checking boring social media sites, and August is coming up, which is basically a Welcome Back to School month despite the first day being in September.  The work is too demanding for my laziness, everyone secretly hates me for being different, and  <e1> my legal guardians are not helping </e1>  because  <e2> my mom only comforts me by having the usual my little angel is on the honor roll attitude </e2> 
I can't talk to any of them	they are getting tired of hearing about how depressed I am	I constantly think about hurting/killing myself.  I have a therapist I see every week, a psych I see once a month, friends, and family members.  But  <e1> I can't talk to any of them </e1> .  Friends and family because  <e2> they are getting tired of hearing about how depressed I am </e2> .  Psych and therapist because I don't want to go back to the hospital.  Everyone's been saying I'm making great progress, and that they're proud of me.  But little do they know I'm still miserable.  I'm still depressed and suicidal.  Nothing has changed I'm just faking it so no one worries any more.  I don't know what to do. . .  
As	way	As of recently I've been becoming very aware of how I push healthier people away from making any sort of genuine connection.  The saying hurt people hurt people seems to apply to me as much as my nfamily members. I noticed that whenever I perceive someone trying to put me down in some way
I feel a bit guilty about excluding her from the wedding	it'll upset her	I'm on very low contact with my Nmother and she is not invited to my 2018 wedding, something I'm sticking to no matter how many people question it.   <e1> I feel a bit guilty about excluding her from the wedding </e1>  as I know  <e2> it'll upset her </e2> , but I couldn't bear to be in the same room as her, especially on such a special day. After we get married, my SO and I are thinking of starting a family within a few years, and I've been struggling with the idea of completely excluding my Nmother from that family - I don't want to lie to my children, but I also don't want to risk possibly pushing them towards her in rebellious moments.  I don't want to never talk about her, but I also don't want them to build her up as this perfect-but-misunderstood grandma in their heads.  And I *definitely* don't want to have a situation in which she ever influences them. Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you handle it? Thank you for any answers!
Every	stop?	Every morning when I wake up I go out to have a smoke.  As I sit there I'm crushed by this wave of anxiety.  I tell myself how shitty of a human I am.  I say things like I'm going to lose my job, that I'm fat, that I'm broke, and that my kids hate me.  Some of the things are true.  Sometimes I turn small thing into huge things. For example, if i bought something for myself the day before, ill tell myself how greedy i am.  It's like my brain is catching to calling me a piece of shit after it took sometime off to sleep.  After about twenty minutes of occupying my brain with task like putting on my uniform it subsides.  I don't like the feeling at all.  It crushes me.  Sometimes I don't even feel like going to work afterwards.  Even though I love my job.  What do I do to make it stop?
My doctor has prescribed me a low does of diazepam	I already have that covered	Like the title says, how do you personally manage flight anxiety without meds?I'm going on a cross country flight for the first time in a couple weeks and I have such anxiety about flying and being in an airplane for an extended period of time.   <e1> My doctor has prescribed me a low does of diazepam </e1>  so  <e2> I already have that covered </e2> .  I want to know what other things you guys might do to keep your mind off freaking out?
I pretty much won't eat anything  unless I've made it or watched it be made in front of me	im so anxious about getting food poisoning or something	Not so much eating food but the way it's prepared.   <e1> I pretty much won't eat anything  unless I've made it or watched it be made in front of me </e1>  because  <e2> im so anxious about getting food poisoning or something </e2> .  I think it also has to do a lot with my need to be in control at all times .  When I feel out of control I get anxious and this includes cooking.  
I	others.	I was diagnosed quite late (like late teens) and didn't start getting medicated until i was 20, so i still have a hard time thinking of myself as someone with ADHD.  It seems to be that I hear a lot of jokes or professional concerns about people who have ADHD (unreliable, generally a mess) and feel concerned about revealing it to others.  
I	feelings?	I suspect I have bpd, and was curious as to whether anybody has insight into what caused theirs? Do you think it is developmental? Genetic? Environmental?The stigma surrounding bpd is horrendous, and I wish more people understood that it isn't the fault of the sufferer.  I've felt this way most of my life, and don't feel as though I did anything to bring it upon myself. Does anybody have any insight into what the cause may have been for them? Or how far back you can trace these feelings?
I chose those names	I love Fall Out Boy	I have two main voices, one who's nice and one who's really mean.  I've given them names.  The nice one is Donnie, the mean one is Benzedrine.   <e1> I chose those names </e1>  because  <e2> I love Fall Out Boy </e2> , and when I get really upset, music is one of the only things that makes sense to me.  That way, whenever I'm upset, which is usually when they talk to me, I can think of them as songs.  I just focus on the music, What a Catch, Donnie and 20 Dollar Nosebleed, and it helps me calm down.  Then I can usually focus on Donnie and do what he's saying. 
I just wish to go back to when I was a kid	when I was pure and innocent	In a few months I'm turning 18.  I'm very anxious about adulthood, and  <e1> I just wish to go back to when I was a kid </e1> .  Back to that time  <e2> when I was pure and innocent </e2> , a time when I could play with toys and watch cartoons without worries, a time where I went to elementary school and learn new things.  Being an adult sucks.  I want to be child again.  
I've always been able to keep moving forward in life	I've had goals	I've struggled with depression for about 10 years now, but  <e1> I've always been able to keep moving forward in life </e1>  because  <e2> I've had goals </e2> .  The most recent of these was to graduate from college.  Unfortunately, like many grads, the job search has come up empty handed.  To make ends meet, I've been working a dead-end minimum wage job that I absolutely hate.  I dread going into this job everyday, but the money is necessary right now.  Hating this job has had a negative effect on my life.  The negative thoughts have been worse than normal lately, and I can't even find enjoyment out of my hobbies anymore.  I think having a sense of self-accomplishment was very important to my mental health.  Since I've lost that, it's been much harder to continue.  So, ultimately, how do you find that meaning in life when everything seems meaningless? 
I'm not gay but my folks are perturbed by homosexuality	This is one thing that really irritates me	I'm new to this sub and sort of new to my unexpressed anger.  I'm easily irritated with my folks who I live with at the moment.  I'm trying to understand where the anger is coming from so I can let it go.  Sometimes I can't even feel it and I just feel numb emotionally.  But other times I feel the anger brewing and need to do something about it.  My folks don't do well with anger expression either.  I don't know what else to say.  I guess I'm just looking for a way to release the anger without hurting anyone.   <e1> I'm not gay but my folks are perturbed by homosexuality </e1> .   <e2> This is one thing that really irritates me </e2> .  I have gay friends and don't like it when they speak negatively about the lgbt community. 
I've	lol.	I've been meditating a lot lately and it's helping.  I've been reading more about the white bear effect where when you try to stop thinking about something you think about it harder.  That loop makes me anxious lol. 
My	now.	My buddy helped me get my table today.  I'm super fucking exhausted.  Didn't mention to my buddy that I was sober.  That was dumb.  He scored.  With me in the truck.  Fuck.  When the guy went to give him more since he was splitting, I saidot with me.  they both paused.  Really? I'm 9 days in.  Going mainstream? no.  I spent so much time trying to look normal that I became inauthentic.  So I'm just going sober.  Cool.  And that was it.  Other than the ridiculous comments about my rack that I get all the time.  Came home.  Unloading truck.  Heading too bed.  Meeting tomorrow for sure.  Pretty fucking proud of myself right now. 
Like	medicines	Like a lot of people here I developed DPDR after a phase of heavy weed/psychedelic use.  During my last trip on LSD I was confronted with an image of myself at that point in my life, and how much of a waste of opportunity I had let myself become.  I remember never feeling like I had come down from that trip, but my DPDR didn't become chronic until smoking weed a few weeks later.  All of my life I have dealt with chronic depression/anxiety, and so while tripping bought on dpdr it was in no way the sole contributor to my current state.  However, something about DPDR scared the shit out of me, and losing the feeling of myself really helped discard alot of the baggage that had held me down for most of my life.  I  went to a psychiatrist and found a stable combination of medicines
Hey	Help	Hey guys I post usually here or on depression sub. I had a job interview last week.  This is the job of my dreams.  I get to travel and meet people and the pay is very very good.  I can't believe it to the point now I'm anxious about it.  Would I be good at this?And what about my kid? I will have to sacrifice a lot of our time together.  But this is my first full time job.  We need the money.  I have been unemployed for over eight months.  This is what I am capable of doing.  I have many odds against me but I feel this is the time to let go my fears.  Specially those of being a bad mother. I have been feeling better with my depression and anxiety.  I take a new medication and been working out.  I have been moving on from my previous relationship and heartbreak. I just feel anxious to mess everything up. Help
I	frequently?	I think being socially anxious has a lot to do with how introspective a person is.  I suddenly realized that my social anxiety is at its worse when my mind leaves my body and I'm viewing myself from a third person perspective.  At that point, I think I judge all of my negative traits and characteristics and assume everyone can see them too.  Hmm, I guess the key is to not assume these weaknesses of mine are so transparent.  But how do I not get into this mode? Is it even possible, because I naturally enter third person very frequently?
Hi,I	hurry	Hi,I got a therapy place where i go once a week to hopefully ease the pain.  Today i discovered that i can't tell my therapist anything what's going inside me because it means insta-lockup in some clinic.  My thoughts are not suicidal and if only someone would tell me how to deal with my problems or just be there for me - i could cope with that and live everyday life.  But yeah, began the therapy telling my therapist the easier problems which we can solve, if go any deeper tho - i get the response that nobody can take responsibility and i need to be locked up.  Is it only a shit therapist or are there other people that offer you legitimate help and are willing to confront your problems?Thanks in advance, and sorry for any grammar errors.  Kind of scared of life right now plus written on a phone in a hurry
Not	life.	Not much to add other than that, just happy to have made it a week. I do feel really good today.  Aside from a bit of a cough I'm feeling much better than I did last week - Chest doesn't hurt, I can breathe, I can smell things (the air conditioning in my car stinks of damp when turned on, never noticed that before!)  Thanks to this sub and everyone here.  Y'all are so supportive to anyone and everyone who posts and wants to quit or is on their journey to a smoke free life.  
My extended family does not speak with me	I confided in them about my father sexually abusing me	I don't have anyone here for me.  I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday.    <e1> My extended family does not speak with me </e1>  because  <e2> I confided in them about my father sexually abusing me </e2> .   My family told them I was crazy and violent
.	it.	. . . ADHD Inattentive Subtype. Psych diagnosed and started treating me a few months back, based on symptoms he saw and therapist's detailed observations, but I didn't finish the full battery of tests and confirm the subtype until now. I feel a lot of things, mostly depressed my abilities in some areas are so poor, and no med works well yet.  And that my life has been built around what I am terrible at.  Damn it. 
I've	hug.	I've had a lot of anxiety starting my new teaching job.  I've taught for 4 years and am now switching schools and grade levels.  Does anyone feel like they spend their time talking and calming themselves from being anxious and then the other times it's slowly building back up? I've had a hard day full of tears.  My husband is on a business trip and I just need a hug.  
Another thing I noticed is that I had this boost in energy	I feel a lot more excited about stuff I normally wouldn't care about	Checking in.  Today was a good day, even though I had another wet dream.  This one was so vivid and it felt so real I woke up feeling the guilt of a relapse. I know I can't control this, but it was awful anyway.  Well, I guess I'll just have to live with it.   <e1> Another thing I noticed is that I had this boost in energy </e1> .  It was unbelievable.  <e2> I feel a lot more excited about stuff I normally wouldn't care about </e2> , and that is amazing.  I got more motivation now. This is going to be a good week! Now, I have a question for everyone here.  What's keeping *you* going? Stay strong and keep going, everyone. 
I feel guilty about everything every day and I get paranoid	everyone thinks I'm a weirdo	All I seem to do is fucking cry,  <e1> I feel guilty about everything every day and I get paranoid </e1>  that  <e2> everyone thinks I'm a weirdo </e2> .  I'm such an outcast and I'll never fit in anywhere I go. It's such a struggle to not cut myself. . .  I've been doing so well recently but I feel likeI'm just slipping straight back into depression and I just want to be happy.  I'm crying reading everyones posts because there's so many people struggling and so much sadness and grief in the world.  Why do we have to fucking live like this.  I wish I could help each and everyone of you on here. , I wish I could help people and do something useful but I'm just one person.  I wish you all the best, stay strong &lt;3
I	now.	I just need someone to open up to.  Can't really do it with anyone in my life right now.  
Woohooooo!	emotions	Woohooooo! I'm almost halfway to my next goal post of 52 days (when I should be able to pass a urine drug screen) but the benefits of quitting extend so much more past that. I feel more conscious every day.  When I was smoking, I was afraid that quitting would strip me of all coping mechanisms and I'd be left completely bare and vulnerable to all anxieties and issues I was afraid of facing in the first place.  Quitting has shown me that I'm a much stronger person than I thought, even without a crutch.  The absence of weed forces me to solve my problems and learn from them instead of stuffing them way deep down and covering them in smoke.  When I had problems while smoking heavily, I would immediately reach for the pipe because I thought it would help me think things through from a place of calm.  I felt like I was really successful in processing my emotions
Hi	Thankyou	Hi there, I am new at this so please bare with me. .  I am looking for advice on ways to cut someone out of your life.  I have come to my limit of dealing with and putting up with my Nmum.  I have had enough of the physical and emotional abuse, and now she has begun spreading lies to people i know (family and family friends etc) about my partner controlling and abusing me.  She is a person who does not believe she did anything wrong when she beat me up (because I was depressed and self-harming which she did not agree with).  I am at the point where I cannot take any more of it and are starting to try to cut her out of my life.  Has anyone here had to do this? what things did you do? It was suggested to me by a supporting friend to come here to look for other ways to do this.  Thankyou
I follow them	they post mascots from an Japanese theme park that makes me happy	Hi there! I'm currently struggling with depression right now after a few users on twitter I used to follow block me from viewing their tweets after I did something wrong.   <e1> I follow them </e1>  because  <e2> they post mascots from an Japanese theme park that makes me happy </e2> .  I tried to apologized to them but they keep ignoring me. I got into the mascots because they made me escape my worries with other characters I used to obsessed.  I dream to go to Japan to meet them.  Now it's turning into another nightmare like I'm at the wrong place. I also just letting you know that I'm a furry.  Now I don't know what to do as much and yet I can't find another good furry-related character to get into as the ones I am currently obsessed.  I'm open to pretty much every hobby but I'm more into gaming. 
There's	relate?	There's a lot of emotions that come with depression, but the main one for me always seems to be those two. I think it's because I feel like I've been wronged one to many times and I'm at a boiling point where I can't stand dealing with stupid people and stupid situations and the structure of our stupid society. I know I'm not the only person in this world to face such things. . . but I feel like Im running out of patience and get frustrated so easily. Anybody else relate?
I	everyone.	I have suicidal thought nearly every day.  I feel like I can't honestly talk to anyone about it without them telling me to get help, thinking I'm weird, or worrying they'll commit me.  I feel like this just makes it all worse and makes me dig a deeper hole.  What keeps you all going? It's my cats for me.  If something should happen to them I don't think I'd continue on.  Does anyone else get dark thoughts? I think about how my one cat passed away and now he's in the dirt rotting.  He helped me so much and now I just move on with my life.  All the people I lost.  Friends family acquaintances.  It just feels really like a joke.  All these people gone but for some reason I'm still here.  I wish I could figure out why it is.  I kind of hope no one sees this.  I just want to be able to vent without being judged or the fear I'll be punished for talking about my feelings.  Thanks everyone.  
I'm	toke.	I'm not in a hazy mindset or distracted, or feeling like I need to sit down after a few moments to rest or take another toke.  
I have worked in all the supermarkets but freeze up and struggle with dealing with the public and it's getting harder to find work	I'm 30 and not much solid experience in anything	I suffer from social anxiety and find it difficult to get and maintain a job.  I live in Newcastle England.  I need help to find work.   <e1> I have worked in all the supermarkets but freeze up and struggle with dealing with the public and it's getting harder to find work </e1>  as  <e2> I'm 30 and not much solid experience in anything </e2> .  I have 2 kids and a wife and I want them to be proud of me.  If there is anyone that could help in anyway I would really appreciate it. 
I	breaths	I can't even describe the solace I get from locking that bathroom door.  Its comforting familiarity, from using it as an escape for years.  The danger and all gone and I'm finally alone and can breathe.  I try to calm myself down with deep breaths
I maybe play for 10-20 min in 4 days	I think thats not a lot	I haven't played for a week, like before.  I never tried to completely stop gaming instant, just more and more going for maybe full stop.  I have joined my friends for playing, I'm now the first to stop and  <e1> I maybe play for 10-20 min in 4 days </e1> , so  <e2> I think thats not a lot </e2> . I have gotten back to my hobbies.  I talk to lot of friends, studied for fun, read books, EVEN MADE NEW FRIENDS. And here the weird part, I really have a bad addiction to gaming, my brain want that brain dead time for gaming.  And damn I hate it, that helps me stop gaming, my pure hate for myself and my habit!I'm so glad about finding this subreddit. 
About 4 months ago I ended a cocaine, heroin, and phenibut bender with three hospitalizations in a week	culminating in me not sleeping for about a week	 <e1> About 4 months ago I ended a cocaine, heroin, and phenibut bender with three hospitalizations in a week </e1> ,  <e2> culminating in me not sleeping for about a week </e2> .  I went to the hospital the second night hearing voices. My voices started as hearing people telling me crazy shit like xyz person is coming to kill you the voices convinced me my then girlfriend britt had planted a bug on me and was communicating with me secret things she'd never say otherwise via normal conversation. To this day I still have an open dialogue with these voices.  Im still convinced it's either britt or the cops running some sort of drug stingThe most scary noise I hear is the skype noise
My	forgotten!	My life has been a total waste of time! There has been nothing of worth in my life and I'm not proud of anything that I've done! I'm inferior to everyone that I know! There is no point of carrying on when everyone is better than me at everything, even the poor person on the street is much better at something than me! I'm inferior, I'm inferior, I'm inferior to every single thing in this world! I should kill myself and be forgotten! 
You	anxiety.	You can't breathe.  You can't speak.  Everything inside you is collapsing.  You feel as though it will never subside.  But somehow you know it will, you just pray it won't be too late.  Your heart pounds and you can't feel your body.  It's like you are looking in from the outside.  Watching as your world collides with every obstacle.  Then it hits you, it's the most wonderful feeling you will ever have.  It's the abatement of the pain.  You can breathe again, and your body feels like it weighs nothing.  Everything releases at once, the pain, pressure, fear, and tears.  It's beautiful! There is a sense of calm you have never experienced before.  You can feel and it's unlike anything thing else.  You feel safe and comforted in your own being.   This is anxiety.  
Hi	covered	Hi I'm a 20 year old man, or boy.  I'm currently in the lovely city of Trondheim, having a great time while visiting a friend.  And soon I want to die. I have thought about killing myself for some time, a few years.  Waited to see if my mentality change through different periods in life.  I realize it's not logical to stop at 20.  It's just that I'm oh so very tired of feeling this way.  I'm very scared of the act, never tried before.  Very scared to fail. The date I set a month before was the second of August, and I'm looking forward to it. I have lived what I think should have been a happy life.  Not that it was in any way sad either.  But I guess that is the way of life :) ty for reading about me. Also random name, don't kill me.  I think I got that covered 
My 5 day taper is scheduled to end Saturday night	I will be completely sober all day Sunday	Had recently been taking 30g's/day for a few weeks.  I have quit a few times including a week about 3 months ago.  But overall I have been taking 15-25 g's/day for over a year now.  Also I was once heavily addicted to opiates probably 7 years ago.  Now I have graduated college and it's time to quit for good and after, land a great job.  I know what this will entail almost down to a science now and I know how to ride it out.  Just wanted to let you beautiful people know that you aren't alone going through this and I don't mind trying to answer any questions, recieving any advice, or just any encouragement.  Stay strong people! <e1> My 5 day taper is scheduled to end Saturday night </e1> .  So  <e2> I will be completely sober all day Sunday </e2> .  However knowing myself, I will probably just jump Saturday, if not Friday. 
But	anymore.	But yet Im resisting the urge to smoke.  Even though I want to i know deep down I don't want to.  Today marked two weeks.  Id be damned if I break that streak now.  Dealing with personal problems sober is the best way, it sucks ass, but it's better than being high and ignoring them.  Even though some of the problems come from not smoking anymore.  
I realized cold turkey was the only way	I slammed a G back in one day with my last being	I wanted to wait a while before I posted anything but damn do I feel good.  I tried scaling back before but slowly old habits would creep in and I'd find myself torching up around the clock . 5g a day or more.   <e1> I realized cold turkey was the only way </e1> .  So  <e2> I slammed a G back in one day with my last being </e2>  a . 2g glob at 11:59 pm 3 Sundays ago to give me a clean slate to start the week.  My rationale was, the high is not going to get any better than this, so I can wake up tomorrow and keep chasing or start fresh.  The first week was almost unbearable but after the first day or two the physical addiction was gone, but the sleeping, stomach and restless issues persisted until the 2 week mark.  But I just want you guys to know you can do it cold turkey, in fact that's what I'd recommend.  Please PM me if anyone needs support.  Bless you guys and good luck. 
I feel calm and at peace but I'm overwhelmed at the same  time	I need to find a apartment in a month and I have no money saved	It's weird.  My mind has been getting more old songs stuck in my head from when I was a child.  I've been dreaming more. . .  I wouldn't call them nightmares but they're triggering dreams where I don't defend myself when someone oversteps my boundries.  I feel like I'm going through some sort of mindset change? It's been 5weeks since my Celexa (ssri) has been increased.  Im moving soon.   <e1> I feel calm and at peace but I'm overwhelmed at the same  time </e1>  as  <e2> I need to find a apartment in a month and I have no money saved </e2> .  I'm just. . .  in limbo is what it feels.  A little dissociated.  Idk.  I'm so lonely.      Any words of comfort? I could use some right now.  
I'm going to a psychologist today to get diagnosed	I think I have a very bad GAD	 <e1> I'm going to a psychologist today to get diagnosed </e1>  because  <e2> I think I have a very bad GAD </e2>  but I'm worried about the money that I'll pay to get tested for physical diseases (Blood tests, Thyroid tests . . etc) I have already done all those tests when I thought I had a physical problem but it was a couple of months ago Will it be okay to tell the doctor that I have done those tests already? or will he insist that I have all those tests done again??I'm almost broke right now :( so how is it gonna be?
It's	you	It's one of those days again.  When the weight of the world you've been carrying on your shoulders finally gets too much to bear and you shatter completely beneath it.  Depression isn't pretty.  It's not being able to get out of bed to shower.  It's eating too much or forgetting to eat entirely.  It's chain smoking until your lungs can't take it anymore while low key hoping they collapse.  It's wanting someone to be there to hold you, but having no body to fill the void.  It's feeling extremely codependent.  It's needing constant reassurance.  It's the constant what ifs.  It's feeling as though you're too broken for anyone to even want to be around you
I'm	this.	I'm getting numbers left and right with the intention of smashing once or twice.  Before I started going through this phase I was looking for a wife, now I'm just looking for a lay.  I really want to stop from going down this path, but I can't seem to stop checking out and talking with random women that I just want to hook up with.  I don't want to be that type of person, but finding a meaningful relationship is very difficult. . .  I'm very conflicted about this. 
I'm just really upset	I get treated like I'm an asshole, when I'm nowhere near it	I must have a certain look to me that people assume my intentions are mean.  I am genuinely kind and only want to help, never make anyone feel bad but I get met with such mean attitudes by a lot of people in the work environment and to a lesser extent in my personal life.     <e1> I'm just really upset </e1>  because  <e2> I get treated like I'm an asshole, when I'm nowhere near it </e2> .  I don't know how to change people's perception of me.  Sorry for the rant , needed to vent.  Thanks for reading.  Anyone else have a similar issue? 
I	today.	I had a bad dream.  It felt like a reflection of all the things I'm unhappy about in my life.  Woke up with a bad attitude.  Ever since waking up I've been grumpy, whiny and irritated and generally UN-FUCKING-HAPPY.  I feel different and I don't like it.  I feel kind of shaky and on edge.  Like my nerves are acting up.  I feel more like glass than steel today.  Days like today are the reason my past quit attempts have not worked.  I remember this has happened before and I started smoking again.  I don't want to start smoking again but I do want to change how I feel today.  
I've been thinking for years about getting out of customer service	I am so jumpy/nervous around people	Hi guys, I am a 26 year old female and so far all of my jobs have been customer service related.  Right now I have an office job at a very small business and it's ok. .  I just feel like I am always worried about the next customer walking in.  My anxiety is crippling most of the time.  I would say that I have no friends. .  Just my boyfriend.  It's really hard for me to even talk to people that I've known forever!  <e1> I've been thinking for years about getting out of customer service </e1>  because  <e2> I am so jumpy/nervous around people </e2> .  I have no clue what to do though. .  I only have experience in customer service.  Does anyone with social anxiety have a suggestion or have a job that they love? Thank you for taking time to read this. .  
For	swear	For some reason, every time I decide to open myself up to someone and tell them that I am suffering. . .  their first response is always Tomorrow is a new day! I wish people would stop saying that to me.  Rarely are my cries for help ever met with What do you need? Or How can I help? I swear
Only slipped up once in the only relationship ive ever had	which is why now is when im more aware to completely stay away from any potential romantic relationship	A relationship is too much for me.  I cant handle things that come along with being in a relationship.  I care too much and it hurts too much.  I know it sounds like just another hopeless person but Ive thought about this for a long time, i made this decision a long time ago.  And right now, its for sure sure.   <e1> Only slipped up once in the only relationship ive ever had </e1> ,  <e2> which is why now is when im more aware to completely stay away from any potential romantic relationship </e2> .  Any thoughts? Any one else like this out there? If yes , hows it goinng so far.  
For	little	For the last few years of my life, I've on and off felt down.  One day I might be fine, thr next I am stressing out about my social life l, that no-one likes me, etc.  Also I often feel this longing for sadness.  I wonder if this is depression.  I honestly don't know what else to call it.  Still though, I don't feel comfortable self diagnosing, when the real deal might be a lot worse than what I am experiencing.  Like I can still have fun and such, I just feel sad fairly often.  So what is your depression like, is it anything like what I am experiencing? If I hear what others have it like, then maybe I can clear up my own mind a little 
Just	high.	Just passed month number 4 and I just got hit with an immense urge to smoke.  The only thing keeping me from smoking is the amount of time I've gone without it.  I'd hate to start back at day one.  What's so bad about it anyway? I became dependent on pot but that's not weed's fault, that was a character defect of my own.  I believe that weed truly does help people to a certain extent if it's handled responsibly.  However, after four months I've gotten to know my sober self and I have improved my life tenfold.  But weed has become so ingrained with my life that even after these few months I still want to get high.  
The	advice.	The suicidal thoughts are overwhelming.  It sucks because things were actually going well.  I have a job.  My family.  I have even been dating.  But I still can't get beyond these thoughts.  Every time I turn around I find myself planning some aspect of my suicide.  No matter what I do I can't seem to stop.  It's almost like an obsession or something.  What do I do to lessen them? I need some advice. 
For	honey	For my job at a nonprofit, I pick up a lot of furniture donations.  A woman phoned urgently yesterday and said she had a lot of old furniture that needed picked up before 6.  So I said sure, grabbed a buddy, and off we went.  As soon as I walked in the door, my jaw dropped and my heart stopped.  There was about a foot of clutter haphazardly scattered about, completely covering the floor- books, magazines, trash, notebooks, tapes, empty cigarette packs, fist-sized dust bunnies, empty dog food cans.  In the middle, a tattered molding couch was regurgitating spotty yellow stuffing.  A thick, heavy odor of urine and mice was stagnant in the air.  This woman, we'll call her Georgine, had absolutely no shame showing us around and pointing out the furniture we could take.  I casually asked her if she was moving out, to which she laughed and said Oh no honey
Hey	socialize.	Hey y'all, it's my first time posting here and tomorrow something terrible is going to happen.  So I'm a boy scout and my county is having an event where scouts from all around come and shoot guns and swim and stuff.  Sounds fun right? Well no people I know is going so it's me and no one I know for 4 days.  I can barely go to a cashier to buy something nevermind spend 4 days with people I don't know.   I feel very overwhelmed and my parents said I had to go and socialize. 
So	assholeness!	So I finally made it to NA!! Ive been to a lot of NA over the years.  And I broke down like the little girl I am.  I ended up sobbing my way through the meeting.  I got lots of hugs.  Drunk guy interrupted the meeting.  I watch a woman pull him out by the arm.  No bullshit, that woman.  Walked in on a chick in the bathroom.  Went in after her.  Blood on the toilet.  Yay.  Met some great people.  Went to a gas station.  Someone had been smoking meth in that bathroom.  All together though, I feel really good about it.  I feel like I made the right choice.  In feeling good about this.  No, dope demon, you can't tell me what to do anymore, with your trickery and general assholeness!
I know he is prior Military	I asked him what he did	I'm a DEN leader in my district and just got back from a camp out.  I noticed one of the parents extremely agitated and withdrawn from the group.   <e1> I know he is prior Military </e1>  so  <e2> I asked him what he did </e2> .  He said stuff.   He didn't elaborate on unit
I'm	.	I'm on my 11th med.  Two have stuck, one more is  as needed, pretty sure 11th won't work and I'll be on to 12 soonLithium (nausea, severe aversion to meds)Lamictal (yes)Trileptal (suicidal)Depakote (current try)Wellbutrin SR (too inconsistent, needed XL)Wellbutrin XL (current)Abilify (shakes, did nothing for mood)Haldol (no psychosis that wasn't med induced)Zoloft (psychotic, suicidal)Klonopin (not strong enough)Ativan (yes, as needed)No wonder finding the right meds feels helpless.  I just want to try fucking latuda.  I might go inpatient if this down swing keeps getting worse.  I probably wouldn't get help there either with my luck. . . 
I'm	else.	I'm glad that it's me and not someone else.  I'm glad that I'm the one that has to suffer.  I'm glad that I'm the one fighting myself everyday and not some other poor kid, someone else that may have given up and ended it by now.  If there's one positive I make out of this life it is the idea that I'm carrying this burden with me rather than someone else.  
This	forward.	This is my first post here but I did post on suicidewatch a while back.  Over the past few months I have been severely depressed but it has come to a head in the past month with being admitted to a mental 'hospital' and respite care, as well as seeing psychiatrists and taking antidepressants.  Today I just found out that I girl I love, is in love with my best friend and honestly I don't know how much longer I can go on.  I hate how I feel but I can't move forward.  
Yesterday	this.	Yesterday I had the mother of all panic attacks.  I've had plenty of panic attacks  for a year and a half and normally I can take on panic attacks quite easily, but lately I've been stressing about my health.  Yesterday without warning I started to feel like thousands of small volt electrical shocks around my body or as if thousands of ants were moving on my skin.  I fell and started to lose feeling and movement in my limbs.  I was sure I wouldn't survive.  Later when the feeling in my limbs returned I went to a doctors clinic.  There they gave me some apple juice and miraculously I felt much better.  They told me my heart beat was high and my blood pressure was a bit low. Today I feel broken, exhausted, depressed and unmotivated.  I don't have the strength anymore to combat this. 
Nmum	others.	Nmum loved to blab about me.    Since I can remember.    I felt exposed and vulnerable.   I believed that everyone could see what a bad,  dirty, lazy,  unworthy child I was.   I tried to disguise myself by pleasing and behaving.  This set me up for a pattern of pushing down myself for others.  
The more mental disorders you have	the more Antisocial Behaviors you exhibit	Little known fact (Maybe well known here):  <e1> The more mental disorders you have </e1> ,  <e2> the more Antisocial Behaviors you exhibit </e2> .  My uncle is bipolar.  On an upswing he will give you his shirt off his back, and on a down swing he will act like a full blown narcissist with a rage disorder. Meet my best friend (at the time, this was like 10+ years ago) hes really REALLY into movies.  My uncle is at my house on a down swing.  My best friend walks in and I try to get the guy to leave.  No dice.  Starts talking to my uncle who constantly, and I mean constantly, steals stuff off the internet.  Like to the point that the police actually showed up to his house on one occasion and took his hard drive from his computer.  My uncle offers Hey man
My parents never installed a lock on my door growing up	My mom would come in as she pleased	 <e1> My parents never installed a lock on my door growing up </e1> .   <e2> My mom would come in as she pleased </e2> , and she still does even though I am 20.  Even if it's 4 am; she will wake me up to talk if I am asleep and even if I am sleeping; she won't realize it and will keep talking.  If I god forbid got some privacy in the shower in the bathroom with that locked door for a few minutes, and head to my bedroom to dry up and change she will magically appear at my bedroom door and knock because she wants to talk, I will then tell her I am changing; she will then open the door so that I can hear her I will YELL at her
I	.	I was going good. . . took two drinks and stopped again. . . lately my life has been spinning upside down and I'm begging for a drink. . . . i can feel the liquor in my throat and warm my chest and I just want to feel the bottle to my lips. . . this hurts. . . 
I	this	I got dumped today by my best friend.  I can't be mad, he did it in a good way and told me he still wanted to be best friends and loved the time he spent with me, but we enjoyed different things .  Please help me I feel so suicidal , I can't do this
i know that i'm an attractive girl and i feel like it's easy for me to get anyone i want	i just spend so much time talking to random guys and getting them to like me and having sex with them	i recently went through a breakup and i'm finding myself falling into an old pattern of hooking up with tons of guys in a desperate attempt to feel wanted and loved for just a little bit.   <e1> i know that i'm an attractive girl and i feel like it's easy for me to get anyone i want </e1>  so  <e2> i just spend so much time talking to random guys and getting them to like me and having sex with them </e2> .  it takes a while before i start to feel guilty but i feel so empty otherwise
I'm	)	I'm lying here in bed like an anxious soggy fish and I honestly feel so shit like what is wrong with me.  I hate this so much.  Can anybody talk to me? I don't want to be alone. (Sounds pathetic but I honestly don't see what I have to lose at this point. )
How	.	How i tried to explain crisis to a loved one:I get paranoid, distorted, desperate, irrational, fearful, depressed and angry.  I feel anxious, alone, abandoned by the world, worthless and so many other things.  To feel all of this in one moment is excruciating, it's confusing and it's pyshically painful.  I'm probably doing a horrible job explaining.  I lose control of my words, my actions and my ability to use my brain.  Everything becomes foggy.  All I can feel, think and see is the pain! I want it to stop,  all I want is the pain to stop!!!!The best why I can explain.  Am I missing anything? . 
I	suggestions?	I get intrusive thoughts all the time, usually thoughts about past situations where I acted awkward or messed up socially in some way, which is all the time.  When the thought happens I try to clear it immediately by making a random noise or jerking my body in some way.  Sometimes I shake my head, sigh, groan, etc. . .  I wish I had a way of coping that wasn't so noticeable.  Anyone have any suggestions?
Hi,I've	:)	Hi,I've been diagnosed with depression and I've told my family but no one seems to want to talk to me about it.  It seems as though they are just taking it as a joke.  They ask, what have you got to be depressed about? Not in a nice/caring way.  My grandad laughed about it.  My mum called me crazy.  My Aunty and grandma say I should see another doctor.  No one is taking it seriously and it really isn't helping.  I'm on anti depressants and I don't want to talk to anymore counsellors or psychologists.  I just want to talk to my family.  Advice please :)
meeting someone irl is out of the question	I have no social skills and feel like a fucking retard when I open my mouth	I'm so sick of having no meaning or reason for being here, I work but if I killed myself tomorrow they could replace me in 10 minutes, i try online dating and have tried everything possible but never get replies,  <e1> meeting someone irl is out of the question </e1>  because  <e2> I have no social skills and feel like a fucking retard when I open my mouth </e2> , got no hobbies because it's like nothing interests me, right now I just feel like a waste of food and oxygen. 
3rd	lol	3rd day clean after 4 years of almost hourly smoking, and I've noticed what might hopefully be a lasting change- lack of upper back pain/painful body sensations.  For the past 2 years I've been plagued with upper back pain that would never go away, and all kind of phantom sensations that , because of anxiety, I would freak out about.  I've just noticed, that during these past few days, my back pain has significantly decreased, not enough that it's gone, but enough that I'm not consciously aware of it at every second.  Even though I've been scrunched up in the most awful spinal position while playin games to distract myself, it doesn't hurt like it usually would. Has anyone else noticed this happening to them? Weed turning out to actually be the cause of pain? If so, I'm overjoyed,, but I don't want to get too excited lol
I	mind.	I just don't want to sit around and live thru my shitty life.  Everyone walks over me.  The people who like me try to manipulate me.  Politicians are liars.  Masses are morons.  I'm too fat and anxious to be the person I want to be.  Everyone turns out to be horrible when you get to know them better.  I just want to end it.  I hate who I am.  Even in success I can't be happy.  I just hate my mind.  
I've	SO.	I've been NC with Nparents for 4 months.  I don't miss them, not at all.  Barely speak to GC sister because we both don't make the effort.  Actually hearing from her makes me super-anxious so I'm ok with not.  I do get a bit worried thinking she'll be mad I don't make an effort to but that's it.  They could literally all just disappear and I wouldn't even notice. Is it weird to be this detached? I do have feelings, there's a nice older woman at my work, when she left I suddenly thought 'I wish she was my mom' and then welled up with tears.  And I miss my SO.  
sorry	them	sorry if this gets a little confusingi have huge issues with confessing.  i feel as if i dont confess every mistake or every detail of a mistake i'll be lying or it will haunt me and plague my life forever.  it's seriously draining! i desperately want to stop feeling this way but i dont even know where to beginI don't know how to stop obsessing over my wrongdoings either, it seems so difficult and i can't imagine a life where i'm not obsessing over them or feeling guilty about themi also doubt my own memory, which ties into my confessing and my obsessions.  i feel like i may be remembering details wrong, or i may be forgetting something *extremely important*, which totally freaks me outso, my question is, how do i cope with all this? where do i even start? don't feel obligated to answer all of the questions, if you have any tips for any one of these issues i'd love to hear them
Everyone	think	Everyone says work out, eat healthy, sleep well, organize your day in advance, be in the present etc.  So why don't I do it? What's stopping me from getting better? Is it that I don't want to get better? Or are these not really the solution to getting better? Because I've tried these things and they've worked for a while, they are either similar to a bandaid or I haven't done them enough so that they become a habit.  I think what is holding me back from getting better is my past.  I've done weird cringey things in my past and I'm afraid I'll repeat them.  I'm afraid that if I let go of this constant monitoring I do of myself, I'll become something terrible.  And of course the constant monitoring is what keeps me unhappy.  I'm also afraid that once I'm happy people will remind me of the things I've done in my past and give me reasons why I shouldn't be happy.  It's a bit crazy I know, but it's what I sometimes think
.	fucked.	. . . . smells like vinegarI hate having to use.  I hate being a junkie.  I hate that my life has led me here and that I have no idea how to get out of the hole i've dug for myself.  <e1> i love opiates so much it's honestly sort of embarrassing.  like a warm blanket or a hot bath that makes time slow down and makes me feel so comfortable.  i am absolutely fucked. 
I	that.	I doubt anyone will read this but I need to tell someone so here goes. . . For a long time I've been using drugs and alcohol to cope with depression.  It makes me feel shitty but sometimes everything gets too much and I just need to escape.  Last night I did something I thought I'd never be able to do and instead of getting high, I flushed the last of my stash down the toilet.  It was one of the hardest things I've ever done and I still hate myself but I feel like it was a small victory and i just wanted to share that. 
I'm	guys	I'm a few days into quitting cold turkey and my appetite is so screwed.  I'm lucky to get 1000 calories a day.  Any advice? Certain foods I should eat and ones to avoid? This is rough but hopefully it comes back soon.  All I can think about is food but when I try to eat I can't.  I'm hungry but I have to force down food( most calories are from juices).  Help me through this guys
I dropped out of college	I lacked the motivation to do any work	I'm ranting a bit, but I have some things to get off my chest.  It may be incoherent, so I apologize. I hate life and existence itself.  I look everywhere, but I can never find anything positive in this world.  It just seems like I'm doomed to work in a job I hate in order to survive and eventually die anyway.  Depression has ruined my life.   <e1> I dropped out of college </e1>  because  <e2> I lacked the motivation to do any work </e2> .  All I want to do is sleep.  I'm too unmotivated to find and maintain relationships whether platonic or romantic.  I'm basically a broke, lonely, unmotivated sack of shit.  I'm 21 years old and watching my life slowly fall apart around me.  I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for many years, but the possibility of me acting upon my thoughts just increases with each day.  I just see no purpose in existing.  I am a true nihilist.  So my question is, what keeps you going?
His tone was of confusion	this is so out of character for me	This is what my boyfriend asked when he found me decluttering our bathroom at midnight tonight.  <e1> His tone was of confusion </e1> .   I know it's because  <e2> this is so out of character for me </e2> .   Decluttering our house and my life is something I've wanted to do for years, but now that I'm not wasting all my free time drinking I can actually start the process.  So what the hell am I doing?  I'm getting better and I'm so proud of myself.   I am capable of so much without alcohol. 
It's	now!	It's my partners birthday and we are away for a long weekend at the snow.  All weekend long everyone has been drinking and it's been a struggle.  I decided this morning I am doing so well I deserve to drink for just one day.  I picked up my boyfriends beer and went to take a sip, then I thought well I've held out this long I may as well wait until we are at the pub for lunch and I can get a wine.  At the pub I went to order a wine then thought well I've made it this long I may as well wait until tonight when we will crack open the champagne.  I've just realised it's now bed time and I haven't actually drunk! After having intense cravings all day I somehow ended up getting distracted cooking dinner and putting kids to bed etc and not actually drinking even though I had convinced myself I would. Feeling so proud right now! 
As	:)	As I write this I have just finished my fifth lesson (so five hours) and holy shit it's difficult.  (UK)I keep getting distracted by things in and around the road, and you start unconsciously moving the car to that distraction.  I'm even distracting myself. . .  trying to change gear I focus too much on that and end up wanting to swerve off the road!So, /r/ADHD, I'm asking for advice / opinion: is learning to drive just this difficult for 'normal' people or does ADHD / similar make it that much harder, and if so is there anything you can suggest? I've commited to at least ten lessons and I do need to drive to advance my career (IT) but I am finding it so very stressful.  (footnote: whoever decided the clutch was a good idea should be shot. . .  three pedals, two feet and it is SO SENSITIVE!)Thanks for listening :) 
I don't even know why I'm here	I was broken down because my last relationship ended	I just wanted to get this off my chest since I don't know where else to turn to.  Do you ever get homesick? I'm in another city and  <e1> I don't even know why I'm here </e1> .  Probably because  <e2> I was broken down because my last relationship ended </e2> .  All I do is partying, drinking and doing drugs.  And I'm not not even enjoying myself.  Tried to go for a walk for a few hours but I'm just back in my room crying endlessly.  Can't even find flight tickets back home earlier.  I hate how my last relationship ended and I hate my mood swings.  And I hate myself.  I hate how I throw things around me and say things I don't mean.  I hate how abusing I am.  I just want someone to hug me and say it's ok.  
.	Wow!*	. . . than the water of the womb.  I woke up this morning with this thought fresh in my mind.  To those of you who, like myself, are experiencing distress over distancing yourself from emotionally abusive family, please listen.  It's ok.  It's ok that you don't want to spend time with them.  It's ok if you avoid family, when seeing them causes nothing but stress and triggers some bad things mentally.  It's ok to choose your own family.  There are plenty of decent loving humans out there who would be happy to be a part of your chosen family.  It's ok if you hurt your birth family's feelings by avoiding them, if avoiding them is necessary for your emotional and psychological wellbeing.  I don't know if any of you needed this.  But I sure did.  If you're reading this, listen.  You are special and deserve to live your own life.  &lt;3*Edit: Damn, I had no idea how well this was going to be received.  It was just something I needed to tell myself this morning, and thought I'd share.  Thanks everyone for sharing your stories, and I'm really happy if I made some of you feel better today.  Wow!*
Well	day.	Well it's been 1 year already, I won't lie and say it's been easy.  It's been turmoil, upsets, arguments and everything in between.   But I'm happy to say I not have a 7 month old boy who isn't dealing with second hand smoke, and for that I feel better every day. 
I get panic attacks daily and I cant reach out to anyone	they turn me away	I get so anxious when I go to a guitar center I cant even bring myself to go inside, I get to the door way and end up walking out of pretty much any store.  I am on some pretty hefty medication that work 40% of the time and most of my therapists have all pretty much told me I am beyond saving/impossible to help.  I barely leave my apartment and I dont like being around people.   <e1> I get panic attacks daily and I cant reach out to anyone </e1>  because  <e2> they turn me away </e2> .  My anxiety has ended friendships and relationships.  Some of my family don't talk to me because of it. 
I have PTSD from my mom	abusing me for the 18 years of my life that I lived with her	I live with my grandma because I can't fully afford my own place.   <e1> I have PTSD from my mom </e1>  psychically and emotionally  <e2> abusing me for the 18 years of my life that I lived with her </e2> .   I left my mom the second I got the chance and I moved in with my grandma.  My grandma's been relatively calm with me; she rarely gets mad, but when she does she's very condescending.  My mom was like this too, but everything ticked her off and I couldn't say or do anything without getting called retarded or getting hit.  I haven't ever been triggered by my grandma(until now) and even though it made me upset I had a well
I	Lexapro?	I need some advice please.  I am currently taking 75mg of Zoloft (generic brand) and in the last few months have gained 25 pounds.  My mom spoke to a doctor she knows and told her that I should switch to Lexapro.  I'm really nervous that I will go through everything I did before therapy and mesication, but my weight is starting to cause a problem within myself.  Has anyone had any experience switching between medications or with Lexapro? 
On	you	On and off smoker for about 3 years.  Still don't feel like I did before I started.  Weed is just so much more potent than it was before.  On top of weed I'm also quitting alcohol and cocaine.  Coke I would only do twice a month for the last 6 months.  I'm done with it all.  Don't ever do coke guys.  I was never even close to addicted but I still remember how good it felt when I peaked.  Hard to forget that feeling.  I feel good and proud to have detoxed for this long.  Will I feel even better at day 100?This is the best subreddit.  I love you all so much.  Be positive, we are all here for you 
X-posting	luck.	X-posting from /r/Lounge because a user told me peeps here are pretty supportive---Pushing friends and family away, steadily losing touch of my hobbies, passions, obligations, and prone to countless late nights, affecting my complexion. My friends and sister have asked for me, I've stopped playing piano and working out, I've stopped looking for a job, and generally fill ill-prepared for life.  I wouldn't hire me. So tomorrow I'm letting League go, doing the same thing I did when I got off it before - take it to my friend's house - with the exception that I'll never trust myself as good enough to manage it on my own again.  It's just not suitable to my personality. It's painful though.  When you're so deep down the rabbit hole it feels like you need it in your life.  Feels hard to imagine not playing.  I've just gotta do it for my sake and the one's I care about. Just wanted to share, as it also it a written commitment.  Wish me luck. 
I am suicidal	I have had pressure from my father, who is a ph d in physics, and my brother, who is studying engineering, to succeed in a STEM major	I am a 24 year old autistic with low giftedness, but they diagnosed me with normal giftedness although I doubt I am normal, with problems with academics and pretty much everything.   <e1> I am suicidal </e1>  because  <e2> I have had pressure from my father, who is a ph d in physics, and my brother, who is studying engineering, to succeed in a STEM major </e2> .   I was also bullied in school for my autism and it was the shittiest time of my life.  Also lost all my friends because expressed thoughts of wanting to kill others, and/or myself. I believe my lack of talent is due to genes from my mothers side.  She is a religious muslim with what I believe low IQ and I have tried to have her tested for it to prove to my dad that she is stupid, but she will not have her tested.  Why live when the only job you can have is a janitor?
Of	today.	Of course I ended up drinking at a wedding.  A couple of ales, I said.  I ended up having about 10 beers and a load of gin.  I'm happy to be honest, it's a reminder that I can't just have a few, that my drinking is problematic and why I'm quitting.  21 days down to 0 days sober, but I'm just going to carry on.  I won't drink with you all today. 
I	it.	I found the stack of threatening letters my Nmom sent me years ago and almost wrote her.  Then felt really crazy. . . she doesn't care! If she cared about anyone but herself she wouldn't have sent them in the first place.  Basically I went NC, and she tried everything even threatening to put me in jail by making up charges (I guess she was going to visit me in jail?) Unless I let her back into my life.  I have got to stop going down this toxic memory lane.  NC was 16 years ago.  Sometimes those memories zoom back into my brain like it was yesterday.  Ruining our reputation.  Making my husband sicker.  Getting him fired.  It still makes me angry sometimes and I wish I could blot it from my mind.  She has painted him evil and I'm just a puppet.  I just needed to vent.  95% of the time I'm over it. 
Hey	thing?	Hey so I think I might have ROCD but idk.  I can't get diagnosed because it's not something that happens all the time.  I had several great weeks and then suddenly I had a bad weekend with a lot of doubt and feeling distant and I cried on the bathroom floor and still don't really know why exactly I did.  But it was fine before that.  I alternate between happy and certain and doubtful and uncertain, I want this to go away I JUST WANT TO ENJOY MY RELATIONSHIP but idk if it's just not right (just the thought is terrible) or if I'm OCD enough for my brain to be the problem.  How often do you guys spike? Can someone get diagnosed when they only feel bad every other week or so or have longer breaks in between? Do you guys experience the same thing?
All	miserable	All I want is to die I am endlessly miserable
I	Luckily	I won't go into details but I've been up all night.  My boyfriend was drunk, and he can get on an angry rant when drunk.  I was smart, and didn't mention you're drunk when he got angry.  Blaming it on drinking can turn into a night from hell.  I really hope he apologizes when he wakes up.  Luckily
Its	empathise.	Its not an edgy vampire thing I just want to know if anyone can empathise. 
I'm not exactly a friendly looking person	no one wants to deal with me because I look like too much trouble	Literally, I want to be happy or at least content with how I'm living but that's already hard enough as is, to make matters worse  <e1> I'm not exactly a friendly looking person </e1>  so  <e2> no one wants to deal with me because I look like too much trouble </e2> , so you know what I like to do small things that make me feel better, but no my friend's feel the need to put me down over it
Things	it?	Things have only been going down hill for two or three months now.  I tried pulling myself out of this pit but whenever I think I'm on solid ground it crumbles and I go back down to the quicksand. I've cut myself badly two separate times in the past month, but whenever I gets to showtime, I am stopped by overwhelming fear of death. For those who have been on deaths door, what is it like? Do you remember it?
In	someone!	In the 100+ times I've tried quitting, I've never been able to make it to 2 weeks.  I am over the two week mark, and I'm done with cigarettes for good.  I feel so good about my new smoke free life! I've already saved well over $ 100 dollars and not smoked almost 2 cartons.  Sorry for my ramblings, but I'm so excited about this.  I just had to tell someone!
I've gotten to the point where I can't even sit back and enjoy the time with my SO	I'm anxious and want to talk about us or the relationship or whatever	How do you shut your mind off a bit when your anxiety and over-thinking starts causing serious relationship issues?  <e1> I've gotten to the point where I can't even sit back and enjoy the time with my SO </e1>  because  <e2> I'm anxious and want to talk about us or the relationship or whatever </e2> .  I hate that I've probably destroyed this otherwise really great relationship with a really great person because I can't get my mind to shut up.  I'm seeing a therapist weekly
I'm	give?	I'm 15, and both my parents smoke heavily. I'm actually pretty afraid of my leath, as they smoke in the house, in the car and even in my room sometimes when my Mom or Dad is talking to me. They have come close to quitting.  My Dad did quit aswell, but my Mom ended up bringing him back to it, as she kept smoking when he used Vaping, and slowly cut back on Vaping until he was done.  (He was close, but didn't ever reach the end. )I'm just scared to lose my parents, and that's why I've made an account for this.  (I don't want anyone I know personally to see this, as some of my friends know my main Reddit account. )My Dad's already lost all of his teeth, he's 47. My Mom has Multiple Sclerosis and Brain lesions, and the smoking to top that off. I just don't want to be this young at the very least when I end up losing them.  Any advice anyone can give?
I often feel that people think im lying	my hallucinations can be very intense	 <e1> I often feel that people think im lying </e1>  because  <e2> my hallucinations can be very intense </e2> .  Wjen i get very stressed or upset the floor dissapears and i cant step on it.  I see gargoyles and shit peering over rooftops (theyre actually friendly and protective and dont mean me harm).  Ice had a lot people tell me these too much to be real and im just making it up.  Does anybody else have similar hallucinations or feel the sake way?
There was a shooting competition on parts of the range	I went to a place I could be alone	Hey all.  First post here.  Its a bit of a weird one.  I like going to the shooting range and I find it relaxing and it was the best part of my time in the military.  Usually I like going with someone but a few weeks ago I was there by myself.   <e1> There was a shooting competition on parts of the range </e1>  so  <e2> I went to a place I could be alone </e2> .  Unpacked my guns and getting ready, the sounds from the other shooters and everything got too much.  I sat down for a while, called my SO and talked.  Packed down my gear and got in the car.  Had a small anxiety attack in the car before I got home.  No idea why I wrote this really.  Maybe someone else has here is shooting with PTSD? I really like shooting most of the time.  Any tips?
Had	gentle)	Had a few serious cravings this weekend, but I made it.  On an unrelated topic,  am I the only one to not finish Allen Carr's book? I mean,  I liked the message and all,  but I couldn't even get half way through it.   I'm truly happy for those that it helped,  but I could not bring myself to finish it.   (Be gentle)
Orientation	offense).	Orientation done.  Starting school next week.  I know im gonna regret this decision.  I dont think this is my 'passion' or whatever bullshit.  I get interested then uninterested very fast.  I hate my life.  Lets just hope this is the right path for me.  Im not surprised if i dropout, but hopefully i wont. . . . . . And i already found that one annoying guy that looks happy at everything(no offense).  
I	copout	I hate when people bring up my SA or when I have to tell others about it, I feel like it's telling someone you have a criminal record.  People don't understand it and then try and say, oh you're just shy or everybody feels that way.  I'm afraid that when I tell people they just think it's a copout
I'm	excited	I'm 19 and just got my first job, it's at an auto store, and I'm on minimum wage, but I did it! A friend set me up there, as he works there, I went and did a small interview with the store manager today, and I start tomorrow, I'm really excited
I'm	Basically	I'm 15.  Young and a fragile kid.  So how I'm about to describe my parents may not sound that bad to you, but to me it's a never ending nightmare.  Anyways I live with my Dad and step mom.  Most of the issues come from my step mom.  Anyway I'm not gonna give a whole life story.  I'm just gonna tell you how they view me and how they voice it.  I'm shy and don't socialize much.  And do they hate that very much.  Is especially my step mom.  Almost every time they're out with friends and I'm there, they always tell them how stupid I look when I don't talk.  I kind of just sit there and smile pretending like it's just a joke.  But deep inside I know it's not.  Basically
it fucks me over real bad	my symptoms are way worse if I'm sleep deprived	I'm curious if anybody else has issues getting to bed (I'm assuming it's not just me since we're generally all shit at doing things on time lol).  It's probably the thing I am worst at above all else, and  <e1> it fucks me over real bad </e1>  since  <e2> my symptoms are way worse if I'm sleep deprived </e2>  (primarily inattentive, I have almost no hyperactivity), and it makes it exponentially harder to wake up on time the next day.  To be clear, I thankfully don't have any issues actually falling asleep once I go to bed.  I'll just fail repeatedly and consistently to get in my goddamn bed on time. Any tips or tricks that work for you?
This	me?	This is me pouring my heart out using a very easy-to-find username.  I just had to tell someone.  I've struggled with depression for many years but have never really seeked therapy for it.  I saw an instagram post of my friends who went away for the weekend.  They didn't ask us (husband and I) to join and these are people we used to hang out with often.  The thing is, I don't particularly like these people, and if I'm being honest, I feel like I can do better, so I'm a total dick, obviously.  Despite all this, I'm feeling really sad that, while I'm busy trying to stay on my high-horse, I'm probably the one that nobody likes.  I think I'm a good person.  I have a few close friends, I'm helpful and while I'm privately critical, I've never intentionally tried to hurt anyone.  What is wrong with me? 
And	shit!!	And I'm super excited to pay bills and see what's left over since I'm not spending it on dope.  And the manic shopping trips.  This is going to be so weird!! Ok.  I'm getting up.  Come to mama, my sweet coffee elixer, and lets pay some shit!!
People running me over and treating me like shit	now I break down into panic attacks	Everyone I know has screwed me over, ever friend I have ever made has left me.  I have been bullied my whole life and I don't why I try anymore.  I be a good person, I help others yet that it is not good enough.  People keep bulling me.  Yelling at me.  I get so lonely.  I hate this so much. Having everyone I know turn on me.  Being treated like I don't exist, everyday is torture.  I can't take this anymore.  I'm not going to commit suicide but Its driving me insane.   <e1> People running me over and treating me like shit </e1> .  So  <e2> now I break down into panic attacks </e2> .  This is not a way to live.  Why should I keep trying when I all I get is being bullied, ignored or back stabbed? My whole fucking life this has happened. 
I've	this?	I've done a lot of work, in therapy and out, to recover from dissociation.  But I still can't fully come to terms with what happened in the past.  First starting out in therapy, I was completely unaware of what was causing all the mental health symptoms.  Then, with the help of a great therapist, I was able to connect emotions to past events and accept that the abuse happened. But it feels like something is still missing.  I still can't think about the past without accusing myself of being a liar and making it all up.  That's my abusive mother's voice in my head.  While I can now accept it happened at an analytical level, it still doesn't feel real.  It's like I have to fight doubts every single time any of it comes up.  I can only think about the abuse in a detached way, as if it happened to someone else.  There are even physical scars staring me in the face, and it still doesn't fully click. Have you found any ways to get through this?
Hi	Thanks	Hi friends,I have smoked about 20 cigarettes per day for the past 2 years.  For the first year I was smoking packs and over the past year I've been rolling Amsterdam Shag.  Over the past few days I've been worrying over some chest 'pangs' as well as a slight constriction in my lower throat.   Is anyone familiar with the throat sensation? I had a chest EKG 2 months ago and was cleared as healthy, so I'm not very worried about that.  But my throat is certainly uncomfortable.   Its subtle but persistent.   It kind of feels as if I have a lump in the base of my throat, and it often feels as if it will be difficult to swallow.  I also think it is affecting the strength of my voice.  I'm hoping this is perhaps just a rawness from the amount I've been smoking over the past few days (I've bee drinking a lot = smoking heavily in rapid succession).   Regardless, I've just thrown out all of my tobacco and paraphernalia.   Happy this subreddit exists for support. Thanks
people don't understand what I am saying	I tend to use a low voice tone and I am not able to spell words properly	So, it's been a while since I started having this problem:  <e1> people don't understand what I am saying </e1>  cause  <e2> I tend to use a low voice tone and I am not able to spell words properly </e2>  (I speak like drunk people lmao) when I am talking to physical people. It doesn't happen though when I am talking to people on the internet (most of the times) or when I am talking to my self. Any tip to get better on this aspect?Thanks ;)
my appetite has slowed to a crawl recently	I never eat breakfast anymore, rarely eat lunch(if I do eat it its usually just a very light meal) I have dinner though regularly	Hi, depressed 17 year old dude here,  <e1> my appetite has slowed to a crawl recently </e1> .   <e2> I never eat breakfast anymore, rarely eat lunch(if I do eat it its usually just a very light meal) I have dinner though regularly </e2> .  Today I didn't eat anything, and I'm not feeling hungry, most days start up with some acid reflux after taking depression meds.  My house doesn't have a lot of food, usually a bit of sandwich meat and assorted cooking supplies for my mother.  We're not poor, my mother is just obsessive about our weight.  No soda or sugary substance is normally found within our house, my sister and overweight brother usually eat whatever stuff id be interested in. I'm just looking for some info on why I'm like this, thanks
Is	.	Is that an issue? Like, I'm so terrified of what a girl would do if she thought I was weak, I would rather my sign of weakness be suicide than I would cry or have them look down on me.  Hmm. . . public suicide. . . . 
Im super worried about gaining weight	i need to lose 40 to 45 lbs	So I have been diagnosed add for 7 years i have been taking ritalin since on and off.  I haav also tried many other things for add, dep, and anx.  Nothing has helped except the ritalin.  NOW my dr wants me to take 150 mg of Wellbutrin and 10 mg of lexapeo.  Anyone had a combo like this? What kind of side effects?  <e1> Im super worried about gaining weight </e1>  since  <e2> i need to lose 40 to 45 lbs </e2> .   Please give me the good bad and ugly. 
I	end.	I had a good job this good pay and decent benefits then I just fucking quit.  I fucking hated the work so much that I decided to just quit and live off my savings then blow my brains out when I have no money left.  It feels so liberating yet I still cling to life for some reason.  Either way I am so fucked now that suicide is the only way out' but at least I will be happy until the end. 
We were both molested in adolescence by individuals of our respective sex	thus struggle to form genuine friendships with members of the same sex	I am a newcomer and a female.  My sponsor is a man in his 20's, as am I.  I understand the stigma and we have openly discussed mutual concerns.  Under any other circumstances, this would not be an issue but I am hypersensitive, vulnerable, and temperamental like I never thought possible and the last thing I want is to respond to passive aggressive 13th step remarks with irrational aggression.   <e1> We were both molested in adolescence by individuals of our respective sex </e1>  and  <e2> thus struggle to form genuine friendships with members of the same sex </e2> .  I am open to any and all suggestions.  My one request is that I not be told to simply ignore judgmental comments.  I am confrontational by nature and have yet to reach this level of maturity.  Thank you all. 
When	it	When I'm on the computer or watching TV, if my phone's in my line of sight I just can't concentrate, even if it's face down or I just see part of it.  It just feels like it's drawing my eyes towards it
Hi	:)	Hi all guys! as the title says, I am at 80 days today and yesterday I started to feel like I have a very light cold, some sneezing, and I trhow up a lot of yellowish catarrh.  I am questioning if it is the quitters flu ( but I know that it would been come the first couple weeks after quitting, and I am almost at 3 months), if it is a normal cold (but here in Italy is summer and usually I pick up a cold on winter, not on summer), or if my cilia's lungs are starting to cleanse themselves (I read somewhere that the lungs capacity to cleanse themselves starts at circa 3 months after quitting). Anyone relates with this? Thank you! Have a nice day :)
I am so afraid of getting out of bed	I am worried that I will just get dressed and go to the store and buy another pack	I can't seem to stop crying since waking up and  <e1> I am so afraid of getting out of bed </e1>  as  <e2> I am worried that I will just get dressed and go to the store and buy another pack </e2> .   Trying to stay focused on other things right now, which is kind of helping . 
I	work?	I have never been able to memorize things no matter what strategy I try to use, but one of the strategies which confused me the most in school was the mnemonic.  For those who don't know, an example is the mathematical order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction.  The mnemonic they taught us was Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.  To my mind, this just requires you to memorize 3 things instead of just 1, so it's 3 times as difficult as just brute-force attempting to memorize the original thing you're supposed to learn.  Does anyone else find these to be impossible, and if they work for you, do you know how they are supposed to work?
Hi	not	Hi SD! I am a career bartender who decided to give up alcohol on the first of July.  Going sober as a bartender has presented. . .  unique challenges.  Drinking is such a big part of the lifestyle that I was afraid that I couldn't do it.  I've been able to stay dry but last night my resolve was tested.  There was a super friendly customer who came in and was trying to buddy up with me.  Throughout the night he bought a few shots of whiskey and offered to buy one for me each time.  I politely declined, Sorry I better not
I self-diagnosed for a long	before seeing a primary care provider who simply agreed and prescribed medication	My background is that I'm currently, with the help of a professional therapist, conceptually shifting to the possibility of having CPTSD as opposed to bipolar. My bipolar was never really properly diagnosed.   <e1> I self-diagnosed for a long </e1>  while  <e2> before seeing a primary care provider who simply agreed and prescribed medication </e2> .  I didn't have access to better care at the time. Now, everything seems to be making a lot more sense to me as I learn more about CPTSD and attend actual therapy sessions weekly. However, I haven't yet come across the idea of positive flash backs.  One of the most disruptive things in my life is getting excited about new ideas and then failing at implementing them because I went too fast and didn't think things through.  Usually this distracts me and takes time away from working at things that would actually be beneficial in my life. The reason I am starting to consider this a flashback and not simply bipolar mania
I notice that when I get less than 5-6 hours of sleep	I have many adhd hyperactive like symptoms and my meds actually calm my brain down instead of slightly speeding it up	Skip to next part for question: I believe I may have been misdiagnosed with Adhd Inattentive type mostly due to hashimotos thyroiditis (hypothyroidism) Nonetheless, I'm still highly interested in learning more about ADHD and how it effects the brain, the unnoticed symptoms, how people act, etc.  I want to hopefully help others with this disorder in the future Since I've learned a lot about this disorder,  <e1> I notice that when I get less than 5-6 hours of sleep </e1> ,  <e2> I have many adhd hyperactive like symptoms and my meds actually calm my brain down instead of slightly speeding it up </e2> .  On a day like this, I notice my time horizon/perception is greatly reduced and I get random urges to do this or that and its a bit hard to ignore and easy to give into.  It sometimes gives me a bit of anxiety until I've done it and then I feel relieved.  I also notice an increase in creative thinking. 
I'm	nothing?	I'm extremely nervous and I don't know why.  I feel like she won't believe me with all of the symptoms I've had for as long as I can remember.  I've heard it's harder to get diagnosed as an adult so I don't have high hopes. . . . what do I do if she passes this off as nothing?
I	get.	I have been a smoker for 3 years.  So far I have been one day cigarette free, I have been using an ecigarette to counteract the withdrawal.  Tomorrow I will be going on a hike and to the gym.  I know it's only been one day but it's one day without a cigarette.  I am proud of myself.  It only gets easier, I hope.  This is my first attempt to truly quit.  I keep telling myself the mantra NOT ONE MORE PUFF or whatever it is.  I am going to keep my mind active.  Anything else I should do? I have thrown out all my lighters and downloaded the Smoke Free app.   I truly believe in myself this time and need all the support I can get.  
I	recover?	I was wondering how long others recovery take?  Sometimes I feel bad I didnt do something sooner to feel better, but I felt paralyzed and I think I tried to move past it alone.   I finally realized I needed some help.   It's been two years and I feel like a human being again.   How long did it take for others to recover?
I	job.	I just got offered a full time cashiering job.  I have really awful social anxiety.  I stutter.  Trip over words.  Just have panic attacks while trying to socialize.  And on top of that, I'm awful at math.  When I get more anxious I easily screw things up. .  :( any tips? I really need this job.  Jobs are scarce here so it's the only one I could get.  I want to do it but I'm scared.  It's also my first job.  
For	alone.	For a very long time now any time there's a bad storm or something, it makes my anxiety go down so much.  To the point I like to put on storm sounds when I sleep at night.  I really don't get it, I was deathly afraid of storms when I was a kid.  But I check the weather all the time to see when it's going to storm.  I sleep better and even feel better and more energized all day.  I hope I'm not alone. 
Not	behind.	Not sure how to explain how I feel nor what good this text will do once I've posted it, but I'm trying my best to think rationally in my time of need.  I've been feeling kind of empty recently, or in better words, without feeling.  An empty shell that's disconnected from what's real.  As I slowly progress into a void of emotion I feel worse and worse.  Each day falling asleep, I hope I never wake.  Having to face each day knowing it will be harder and more difficult to get through.  I've had fleeting suicidal thoughts in the past, although now all I can do is fantasize how pleasant it would be to cease to exist.  All of the people I continually let down would be freed from my consistent failure to please.  I try my best to bring up everyone's spirits, while my own slowly dies.  I'm seriously thinking of killing myself and leaving it all behind.   
How	me.	How do you hold down a job, have a partner, own a car, own/rent a place and stay sane all at the same time? It just doesn't make sense to me.  I can't even do one of these things.  I'm so tired of being me.  
I	state	I learned it from Robert Sapolsky (*Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers: The Acclaimed Guide to Stress, Stress-Related Diseases and Coping*) who learned it from Joseph Wolpe (*Life Without Fear: Anxiety and Its Cure*) via Bruce McEwen (*The End of Stress as We Know It*).  Most people in states of high anxiety and anger are actually reacting to threat and experiencing the general adaptation syndrome of the autonomic nervous system.  In that state
being at the diamond for a game or practice makes me feel nostalgic and also at home	it's what's always made me happiest	(Warning: Occasional baseball or softball lingo here.  You have been warned. )I am extremely passionate about softball and baseball.  The best way I can explain it is that  <e1> being at the diamond for a game or practice makes me feel nostalgic and also at home </e1>  because  <e2> it's what's always made me happiest </e2> .  Hitting reminds me of when I was a kid and how proud I felt when I first hit a ball with enough force that it rolled to the outfield fence.  Wow
I	year.	I know y'all can't diagnose but I'm wondering if anyone can relate or has any inputJust started depakote added onto my others.  I was depressed soon after starting (suicidal thoughts I lied about) but then at my support group I was depressed but talking crazy fast but I swear I do that when I'm anxious not just hypo.  Crazy anxious for a couple days.  Few days later I went to an event with some friends and I was energized and super motivated.  That lasted all night.  Then today I got crazy depressed again.  Then super happy, insightful, felt awesome, then that slipped very quickly into depressed, helpless, and wanting to self harm which I've never seriously done.  I dug my nail into my arm hard instead. I don't know what the fuck is going on.  I don't have control over things.  I have no appetite so I don't want to eat and I'm struggling to get anything down.  This sucks.  Pdoc is useless.  He said I'm out of options after depakote which is crap.  Screw all of this, it's not fair and I can tell it's gotten worse over the past year. 
I	mind?	I returned home today from a two week trip to Hawaii only to realise that I had no one to tell I was finally home.  As soon as I walked through the front door of my empty house, I started bawling.  I couldn't stop it even though I kept telling myself to.  I feel so alone and I don't know what to do about it anymore.  What's the point of trying if I'm always just going to return to this state of mind?
I'm	trying	I'm tired of hearing this kind of thing.  In the past year, I've come out of the closet, I've started therapy, I've started on antidepressants, I drink less, stopped smoking weed, I've gotten less suicidal and I self harm less.  But still, its always more and more about getting my shit together.  Can't they see that I'm trying? I'm not better yet but fuck, I'm trying 
Hi,I	miserable	Hi,I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been feeling more and more anxious, and I feel like I have no one I can talk to.  I tried looking for suicide hotlines but there's literally not even one single hotline in my country and in desperation I decided to write here.  I'm not even sure if this is gonna help, I just know that I've never felt as suicidal as I have right now and I just don't know what to do anymore.  I don't know why I'm sad, I don't know what makes me happy, I don't know where all my friends went and I have no one I feel I can talk to.  I just don't know what's wrong with my life. . . Fuck it I can'tNothing's gonna work. I'll always be miserable
I have been thinking for the past 6 months on and off about having sex with strangers	i can fucking feel something	I am 17 and in my final year of highschool.  I have been fucking miserable for the past two years and despite seeking psychiatric help and taking medication, I still feel this sickly feeling inside.  80% of the time I feel fucking empty and the other 20% I feel like I've had my heart broken and I've hit that rock bottom sinking feeling.  Either way I feel utterly trash and hopeless. ANYWAY  <e1> I have been thinking for the past 6 months on and off about having sex with strangers </e1> , just so  <e2> i can fucking feel something </e2> .  I'm still a virgin and I'm not exactly what someone would see as a sex fiend so idk how to go about it.  I have been spending a lot of time on craigslist browsing but everyone there is old as fuck and i'm not legal - But idek if i care at this point??Have any of you encountered this weird desire before? How do you deal with this? I just want to feel something 
I	this?	I have been a smoker for more than 3 years.  About a week ago I felt dizziness, nausea, adrenaline and my heart was beating like crazy while smoking a cigarette.  I could barely move and put my cigarette out.  It felt terrible and I started hyperventilating.  I managed to call an ambulance before almost fainting and they put me on intravenous sedatives for a few hours.  Milder symptoms returned after again trying to smoke the day after and a few days later.  I haven't touched a cigarette since then but I'm very concerned about this.  Did I fuck up my lung or heart? Anyone else ever get this?
Ok,	deal	Ok, so after being a depressed cunt for a while, I've organised to see my friend that I haven't seen in almost a year now one to one, and if it goes well, the I've ruined my life feeling will be gone.  This is the real deal
Ever	this	Ever since I was 13 or 14 years old, I started realizing that life is just a useless game.  I was born into this world against my will and was forced to live a lie I never wanted to live.  I feel society has ruled our ways on how to live a life.  You have to meet certain requirements to be deemed as successful.  Regarding this
While	No	While bored at work yesterday and browsing reddit, I came across a picture that hit hard.   It was Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes as a young man, dressed in a suit and carrying a briefcase.  He looked defeated, his gaze was at his feet.   A thought bubble trailed behind him with a picture of his younger self with Hobbes, zooming down a hill in a little wagon. At first I thought, Is this what I have to look forward to?.  No
My	thoughts?	My psych's reasoning was this: give somebody a test or series of tests for ADHD and what you get out of it is data points.  Those data points are then open to interpretation and different psychs will interpret them differently. Essentially, he's saying that with tests you can send a person who has ADHD to multiple doctors and get multiple conclusions of either yes or no for a diagnosis. I quite agree with my psych.  What are your thoughts?
Just	today!	Just wanted to say thanks to this sub, you guys have helped during the hard days when I needed a boost.  The last few days have been a struggle, but I pushed through it.  If anyone out there is struggling hang in there, it is so worth it.  I am very proud of my number count and believe it or not it has also been a motivator for me to stay sober.  3 months ago I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but if a 3/4 liter of vodka a day drinker can do it you can too! I will not be drinking with you awesome people today!
I	30's.	I love how this medication makes me preform at work , but I have issues when it starts to run out.   I get angry when things don't work out , or equipment isn't working and I rage pretty hard .  I would dose up again , but then I fear I won't sleep .  It also effects my relationships because later at night I come down from it and become irritable.  How do you guys deal with this ? Or what were your experiences like ? I took this medication from 10 -15 and just started up again in 30's. 
Hello	drugs?	Hello Reddit (first post *woooo*).  tl;dr: When you've been medicated for a long time, do you retain the medicated feelings in the evening when your daily dose has worn off? Does the anxiety as the meds wear off decrease as you get used to the meds?I am in my late twenties.  I was diagnosed as having ADHD yesterday (as soon as I was diagnosed I then decided I was a fraud.  Stupid brain).  I have had issues with anxiety since my teens, with one stay in hospital due to intrusive thoughts.  I take an SSRI, which helps significantly with my intrusive thoughts, but offers a lovely emotional blunting. I took my first dose of Adderall XR 10mg this morning and didn't really notice much.  However, did find I was less annoyed by people making noise, I was more pleasant to be around and actually focused at work :O :O :O This could all be placebo, so the coming weeks will tell.  My question concerns the come down, I am feeling rather anxious now I am at home and the drugs are out of my system.  Does this spike of anxiety decrease as you get used to the drugs?
Last	tonight!	Last night, while out of town on a work trip, I decided that I'd finally had enough and was going to try to kick alcohol for good.  I made it through a whole evening without drinking for the first time in I don't even know how long.  Tonight when I came home there was the remainder of a six pack waiting for me in the fridge.  I thought about drinking it.  I even opened one and poured it into the glass.  When I lifted it to my nose and took a whiff I realized that I didn't even TRULY want it.  I dumped all three IPAs down the drain! It hurt a little, but it felt like the right thing to do. Thanks to The Naked Mind and a whole lot of courage and mindfulness, I am going to make it one more night.  I will not drink with you tonight! 
I'm	out.	I'm so tired.  I've tried to be a good person.  I think I have.  But I've never been a successful person.  I'm soon to be a two time college drop out.  I'm just so awful at being a successful person.  People always seem to take advantage of me.  I get hurt by so many people.  I know there are people who care.  That's the only part that makes me hesitate.  But isn't it enough that I've worked to help other people.  I've worked so hard to make other people happy.  I want to die so badly.  Why do I have to feel guilty about it? I just want to die.  I've done so many things to earn it.  I'm not happy I won't ever be happy.  I can't even remember the last time I was happy.  I'm never going to be happy or successful.  Why should I have to continue this miserable existence.  I have no future.  I'm out of options.  I just want to go.  I don't know what to do or say.  Thank you for reading.  If it helps, assume that everything worked out. 
I can't attend lessons	I get sick and vomit	Has anyone here been so anxious constantly that anxiety makes them sick to their stomach and they vomit and get so dizzy? It's becoming really hard to function and even when I make it to school,  <e1> I can't attend lessons </e1>  because  <e2> I get sick and vomit </e2> .  Any tips on how to handle everyday life when you constantly feel like you'll either vomit or faint and there's nothing you can do because you don't know how to get rid of the anxiety?
I am pretty sure I have avoidiant personality disorder.  I have to isolate myself	I am afraid of being akward and embarrassing myself	 <e1> I am pretty sure I have avoidiant personality disorder.  I have to isolate myself </e1>  because  <e2> I am afraid of being akward and embarrassing myself </e2> .  If I do try to talk I usually am akward because I can't hold a conversation for shit.  My blanks out and don't what to say or know how to respond.  When I try to talk I ask questions and don't know how to follow them up and If I try to force out a  statment It usually ends up being really akward or random.  I've had a couple people I've felt comfortable with but pretty much everybody else its just blank.  I've been like this since I was a kid and don't know how I can get over it. 
When you are depressed you don't desire anything(and thus don't care)	you expect nothing to result in happiness for you	It seems like in order to have drive you need to have a goal in mind that you want, but in order to have a goal you need to expect it to bring you happiness.   <e1> When you are depressed you don't desire anything(and thus don't care) </e1>  because  <e2> you expect nothing to result in happiness for you </e2> .  So how on earth can you find drive when depression takes away your desire for anything. . . . how can you set a goal when you don't really care about the goal anyway. 
So	)	So i have orientation for my new job in an hour, im super nervous and thought id make this post to take my mind off it.  I also wanted to make it to push others that suffer from anxiety to step outside your comfort zone.  It has been the hardest thing to make myself get this job, but i feel after the initial hump it will turn out ok.  Just remeber everybody gets nervous and anxious when attempting something new, you are not the only one so dont feel like an outcast.  Good luck to anyone who may be trying something new in hope of a better outlook on life, if i can do it you can do it.  Have a great day all and wish me luck.  ( i know there are tons of grammar mistakes i wrote this fairly quick. )
How did you break through the fear of being judged by someone	Cause I can barely go outside anymore	I'm honestly just curious and am looking for some advice and possible tips.  I'm struggling with all of the areas I mentioned because I'm just scared shitless about being rejected.  Aren't all people with BPD though? So how the hell did you manage to make a move? How did you manage to not feel like you need to be in control of the possible outcome?  <e1> How did you break through the fear of being judged by someone </e1> ?  <e2> Cause I can barely go outside anymore </e2> . 
I	alone.	I want to go but I'm really scared.   Can anyone advise me on how a typical meeting goes?     I went to a couple of AA meetings with a friend years ago.  Are they structured similarly?    I do want to go but am worried I won't be able to make it there alone. 
What	people.	What does it mean when your friends or family call you stupid all the time? I mean call you stupid as in you're a true blue idiot not because you said or did something funny/silly and stupid for a laugh.  But when you actually believe it and a situation comes up to where u admit that you are one ,they get angry at you for believing that you're and say that you aren't.  That you're always playing dumb and not actually dumb.  Im genuinly confused as this been going on for practically my whole life.  Can any provide any insight for me? It honestly makes me just want to stop speaking to people. 
Hey	anxiety?	Hey guys so I've been dealing with generalized anxiety disorder on and off for the past 3 years now.  I've been to therapists in the past but mainly I've battled through it alone.  I usually have a period of having anxiety attacks and then they  a stop for a while.  Up until recently, I was doing really well but unfortunately I've slipped into a cycle of having anxiety attacks as a result of some unavoidable things going on in my life.  Honestly, I've forgotten how horrible anxiety attacks can be and ever since I've started to have them again, I've not been able to eat at all or when I do, I vomit it back up during an attack.  This hasn't happened to me before and I'm incredibly worried about it. I was just wondering, is it common to have problems with eating when you suffer from anxiety? 
You don't want to go	you'll feel awkward having to talk to people you don't know very well nor particularly like	 <e1> You don't want to go </e1> , because  <e2> you'll feel awkward having to talk to people you don't know very well nor particularly like </e2> .  If you decline, you'll feel rude for doing so.  Lose-lose. 
Music	depression.	Music is very much a therapy for me.  I listen to a lot of NF and that helps a shit ton, I highly recommend him to anyone else struggling with depression.  I'm really curious if there are any other artists that make meaningful music that can help with depression.   
It's	evening!	It's really crazy how much more energy I have.  I wasn't drinking that much, but shit I would just get home and be sedentary before.  Today I came home to an empty house, sat down for 5 minutes, stood up, changed into some stretchy pants and hit the climbing gym.  Bouldered for 2. 5 hours, sent a couple projects and went home.  Usually I need somebody to want to go climbing with me in order to get my ass out to the gym, not today.  Haven't gone of my own volition in 2. 5 years. . .  I hope you're having a nice, rememorable evening! 
I've quit smoking	I can get active again and start losing some weight	I just hit 30 days and honestly I'm feeling pretty impartial about the whole thing.  I'm happy that I've quit but I know that I'm not fulfilling the list I set up for myself. Now that  <e1> I've quit smoking </e1>   <e2> I can get active again and start losing some weight </e2> !I've been sort of stagnant since I have quit smoking and feel that If I don't start making some real improvement or steps to improvement now that I have quit.  I will have a bad day and say  Fuck it
I told her on the phone two days ago	she immediately got harsh and accusatory	I deleted my post from earlier bc I felt silly but now i'm mad I told her I got approved for a Condo and I was moving.  I did this all on my own.  Earlier in the summer I mentioned wanting to move and she dismissed me and told me she doesn't want to be involved at all, probably because she assumed that I couldn't do it without her.  Well I did it.   <e1> I told her on the phone two days ago </e1>  and  <e2> she immediately got harsh and accusatory </e2>  and told me I can never afford it and I should be working way more, etc.  I was getting aggravated and said I already paid for it and she said, and here comes your whiney bitch voice.  I hung up.  There was zero contact for two days but i knew there was a storm brewing. She finally came for me tonight and it is just the most bizarre argument I've ever been a part of.  I don't even truly know why we're fighting.  I reacted poorly.  2/10 would not recommend.  I don't know why I feel like I've done something wrong
alcohol makes the anxiety worse	it gets out of your system so like xanax it requires constant re dosing	I used to be outgoing but mostly fake.  I'm a bit awkward when I'm myself, playing a better version of myself and drinking helped.  Drinking in excess helped me feel better but exacerbated the problems with anyone who knew me.  I began alienating people and felt sick most days.  You're not alone man this social anxiety shit sucks.  Good on you for getting off xanis but  <e1> alcohol makes the anxiety worse </e1>  as  <e2> it gets out of your system so like xanax it requires constant re dosing </e2> .  I'm doing my best to talk to people while sober and it seems to be helping but we need to stop drinking and force conversations.  If you don't it only gets worse. 
life means nothing	that scares me	I am not religious, I know humanity will fade, I know the universe even will go dark, so is there any point in anything except my own personal meaning.  Every conversation, every memory, adds up to nothing, we'll die, our children will die, and so on.  I don't think I will kill myself but  <e1> life means nothing </e1> , and  <e2> that scares me </e2> , I'll laugh at it, but deep down I keep thinking nothing you or anyone ever does will matter so what's the point.  Earth is just a cruel joke, and we're the victim.  War, death, and the vastness of the universe and how alone we really are.  So why live? Why continue under society's thumb? I'm sorry to rant, but nothing is starting to matter to me, and I've been surrounded by people, but I've never felt so alone. 
I	me.	I meant the final exam I was taking.  ~~Get bamboozled~~I don't think I'm hoping out of the cold turkey train.  I have a long road in front of me. 
I was very frustrated with myself	I would fail	Hey guys, you may [remember me from a week ago].   <e1> I was very frustrated with myself </e1>  and figured this time  <e2> I would fail </e2>  like every other time, but I haven't! It feels incredible.  Sleep is still a bit tough and my stomach feels uneasy from time to time, but it hasn't stopped me yet. I feel so much more clear headed.  I've already begun putting my life back together - I even started exercising! It's incredible the weight I feel lifted off of me just after a week.  I'm looking forward to the future and I am confident that I won't feel the need to go back ever again. Thank you all for the support some of you gave me in my first thread.  I hope you all are doing well on your journeys!
He only stopped for a minute	he was in my city and got lost and ended up at my place	My dad stopped by my apartment last night.  Called my phone at 10pm asking if I was home because he was outside my apartment.   <e1> He only stopped for a minute </e1>  (thankfully) because  <e2> he was in my city and got lost and ended up at my place </e2> .  We're talking a little bit, then he starts with hope you're not mad
Truly	great	Truly didn't think this day would come. In 31 days I haven't had so much of 1 puff of a cigarette.  I still have the urge to smoke but it's not strong and it's easy to reroute my thinking. I'm pretty fucking proud of myself.  Almost 500 cigarettes avoided and (according to the app I use) 7 days I've gotten back. I hope everyone has a great
I had social anxiety all throughout childhood	I never joined a sports team	 <e1> I had social anxiety all throughout childhood </e1> , and it was at it's worst for me during the time when most kids were figuring out their hobbies and what they loved to do-but I was always too anxious to do it or stick with it.  So  <e2> I never joined a sports team </e2>  or cheerleading or band or learned how to play a musical instrument or continued with dance lessons or whatever.  Some of it also came from me living in a small town with extremely limited opportunities for stuff like that, and I wouldn't have enjoyed some of that stuff anyway, but for example I love music and I really think I would have enjoyed sticking with learning how to play an instrument, but all my friends had learned years prior to me and I was afraid I would look dumb and ignorant in front of everyone else who already knew how to play.  Now I'm not a kid anymore and I feel like I don't really have hobbies that are fully developed outside of the typical introvert quiet hobbies like reading
I never start working toward	I'd have to go outside	I have had social anxiety and social phobia for basically all my life.  I've tended maintain some friends from jobs and when I was back in college.   However since moving a year ago I feel like I've lost track.  I can't seem to get out of the house most days except for maybe work.  I don't know how to make friends and even keep any of the people I do know.  I just get upset and anxious sitting at home being bored watching tv.  I don't even game much anymore.  He depression from all this has gotten so intense.  I feel like I want to be with people, and I may be extroverted but it's hidden by so much anxiety being around people.  I have dreams and goals that  <e1> I never start working toward </e1>  since  <e2> I'd have to go outside </e2> .  Has anyone had experience getting out of being a shut in? I'm so unsure at this point and afraid to do anything.  Sometimes it feels I'm just not strong enough to get over it.  Like I'm too lazy to live.  I'm at such a loss. 
Being	nice	Being dressed up, being told to stand somewhere for photos, being told how to pose, and nsister giving me annoyed or dirty looks if I don't pose the right way or do what they say.  Nice arrangements on the table that I never eat at so they can post it on social media for bragging rights.  I just wanted to do my own thing today.  I haven't had a good birthday nor have I celebrated it with anyone other than nfamily in several years.  I was content already.  They have to make a big deal out of things and then remind me that I'm only turning this certain age once to guilt me into looking nice
The little 'awwww' and pleased smile and giggle she gave	made me happy	I've been so depressed the last few weeks, but I had a pretty sweet day today and I wanted to share.  I woke up and weighed myself as I do every Saturday morning, I've been trying to lose weight for the last couple of months and as of today, I've lost 13kg! Still obese but it feels good to be making progress! I went for a driving lesson and went really well, my instructor said he would book a test gor my license soon.  I went out for lunch with my mum and her bf to a cafe with a gorgeous waitress I've been crushing on for a little while, and finally told her I thought she was pretty and gave her my number.   <e1> The little 'awwww' and pleased smile and giggle she gave </e1>  when I told her she's pretty  <e2> made me happy </e2> .  Then I'm going out to dinner latwr with my mum her bf and my brother, then movies with a mate after.  All pointless info, but I feel very accomplished today and I'm happy :)
it was so sad	how most of my OCD isn't about the actual shower, but feeling that I am clean	I normally shower 3 times each day, showering more in a week than most people shower in a month.  So, traveling to a relatives house with no power is an image of hell to me.  To those with hygiene based OCD, how would you handle this?? I poured a gallon of water over me and pretended to shower with cleaning wipes,  <e1> it was so sad </e1>  to realize  <e2> how most of my OCD isn't about the actual shower, but feeling that I am clean </e2> .  
I don't eat many fatty foods	anything I take affects me a lot harder	Just like the title says, I just started meds, being vegetarian  <e1> I don't eat many fatty foods </e1>  so  <e2> anything I take affects me a lot harder </e2> , which is why 10 mg is perfect for me. before I started taking Focalin I never had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.  Now 2 or 3 hours after I go to bed I'm feeling like it's time to wake up.  I've started taking naps in the afternoon to offset this, which seems to help somewhat. Is there some simple solution to this that I'm missing?TL;DR Having trouble sleeping through the night on a ridiculously low dosage. 
My buses are being delayed by this thunderstorm	I'm going to be late for work	I'm waiting at the bus stop, on my way to work.   <e1> My buses are being delayed by this thunderstorm </e1>  and  <e2> I'm going to be late for work </e2> .  I'm bored as fuck, but I'm not going to smoke.  I'm enjoying my ritualistic cup of morning coffee, but I'm not going to smoke. . . . cigarettes don't cure bordem, they just kill you while you're bored.  Also, cigarettes and thunderstorms. . . . don't mix.  
Ever	too.	Ever since the start of this year I'd started having very long hot showers everyday atleast three times or more each day.  I just find the warm water on my body greatly soothing and relaxing, sort of like a stress reducer.  It allows me to think and gives me a safe place for 30 minutes at a time. I don't even do it to clean myself anymore.  I just crank up the heat and wait till the water becomes cold and then I'm back to the real world.  It may have something to do with my mild anxiety.  Does any body else do this too. 
To	control?	To be honest, I don't know if this is the correct place to post this, but I'm worried about developing bad drinking habits.  I went to a family reunion and drank more than I meant to.  The reunion was about 3 days and I drank about all 3 of those days.  I usually don't drink that many days in a row, but it was a special occasion.  That was last weekend. Last night, I had 4 hard ciders.  I didn't drink anything over the week, but after last weekend, I felt disgusted with myself for drinking 4 drinks, especially after my drinking last weekend. I usually try to limit only drinking once a week, which is usually the case.  But I feel like i drink more than I want to when I start and realize it is hard to stop at just one.  I don't want this to develop into a habit.  What are some things I can do to have better control?
I'm a lot happier than when I tried	I was absolutely miserable then	i'm in my 40s now, I tried being social from my mid 20s to early 30s.  It was a horrible experience for me.  I can't say that I'm happy, but  <e1> I'm a lot happier than when I tried </e1> , because  <e2> I was absolutely miserable then </e2> .  perhaps I'm being avoidant, but I prefer lonliness to misery.  Does anyone else feel that way? I'm completely accustomed to this.  in fact, the thought of what is normal for others, having relationships, marriage, living with someone, is horrible sounding to me.  I'm at the point I can't even use the bathroom unless nobody is even on the same floor, or preferably the same building as I am.  I'm just so used to my life, my privacy. 
I	quit.	I lit my first cigarettes on new years, 2016.  It's been 18 months and I have smoked almost everyday since then.  It just felt amazing.  Not just the morning buzz, but what it stood for.  For the depressed, lost teenager, it provided structure.  For the shy introvert, it provided doors to first conversations and so many friendships.  My addiction to cigarettes is more than physical.  For the past 18 years, I've seen it as the glue to my life.  But I need to quit. I'd be lying if I said my health has not significantly diminished.  My lips are strikingly dark, 2 of my teeth are stained and I can barely run for 10 minutes without wheezing.  I'm on day 2 and it has been extremely difficult so far.  My chest feels congested, my head hurts and I can't fall asleep.  Earlier today, in a moment of weakness, I gave up and walked to the store to get my fix but managed to fight it off on the way and walked back. This is extremely difficult.  Slowly, the reason I've been giving myself, that my health is diminishing, seems to be becoming weaker and weaker.  I need motivation to quit. 
I	me.	I have had pretty bad anxiety lately.  When I wake up it's the first thing on my mind.  My mind races with thoughts like, what if I have to fight to have a good day for the rest of my life? Why can't I just accept anxiety? Will I end up having to take meds? I started exercising about 45 mins in the evenings after work.  I can tell the exercise helps so much.  But every morning it's the same thing until I can get my exercise in.  It really sucks.  I'm afraid of getting really down &amp; out &amp; losing hope.  That thought scares me.  
I'm	Please.	I'm isolated and alone as usual.  It's becoming almost too much to bear.  I just want to talk to someone who will listen.  I'm begging.  Please. 
Honestly	depression)	Honestly I don't know if what to get medication cause of my mom.  She doesn't really want me to have medication, but what can I do? Be anxious all day at school and not concentrate or have panic attacks? I'm just so lost.  I don't feel good today, I just want to be alone today and I told her that and it worries here.  I'm an introvert and there are days that I want to be alone.  I'm just so lost and honestly, I feel like crying. What's your opinion on medication for anxiety? (I also do have depression)
I'm truely ashamed	breaking	A couple of weeks ago I posted about quitting, and I have broken that no smoking cycle on several occasions since.   <e1> I'm truely ashamed </e1>  at myself for  <e2> breaking </e2> , but a habit is hard to break.  The temptations sadly don't leave right away and it screams in my head that it needs weed.  I've been clean again for a full day now, and I've taken it upon myself to get rid of the important tools and whatnot that I would need to smoke.  I'm also in my 20's and my parents are able to see my purchases.  The good thing about that is I wouldn't want them to see that I used my card to by weed, and I make sure not to have a lot of cash on me that way I won't have enough money to purchase anything.  My addiction has gone too far and I don't want to be stuck with that habit forever.  I've been sober for an entire day now, and I plan on being sober from this point forward. 
So	.	So my anxiety got worse during this last few weeks.  I think about everything, at every time, for about 1000 times.  My mind can't chill anymore.  Normally I talk to my boyfriend &amp; that will calm my mind down, but now he's on vacay with friends, which causes more anxiety.  but now i don't have him to talk with, so i am not able to chill at all.  anyone any tips? trying to think or do something else helps, but i can't 'do' something 24/7 , but i have so much trouble sleeping. .  
Went	:)	Went out to the country for some R&amp;R. . .  really doing me good! Relaxing with my family, and spending quality time together. Slept ok last night, sweating was minimal.  Haven't had any dreams since that one night. . .  can't wait for them to come back.  Eating a little better. Haven't had terrible cravings out here, but I have been stuck in thoughts about ever smoking again one day in the distant future.  I'm not tempted, but it's as if I haven't really settled with the fact that I can't smoke again ever.  I try to rationalize that it's really nothing serious, and as it becomes legal, I can one day go back without guilt. . .  as if alcohol isn't legal, and as if that was the only reason I quit.  The mind is a silly thing.  I needed to remind myself why I'm doing this, as apparently I forgot :) Reading my own journal really helped, and I'm so happy that I've been writing this in retrospect. I'm doing ok, and that makes me happy. . .  thanks all for the PMs and follow-ups - appreciate it! I would have never imagined that a bunch of strangers would be so impactful on my life :) 
(This	myself	(This is a throwaway) I'm a 23 yo male living in France, currently a student in university.  I've been having low and high points as long as I can remember.  Everytime I think it's finally over depression comes back harder after a few months.  Now every time I get even a minor disappointment the very first thought that comes to my mind is I should kill myself.   Some girl decides to leave me ? I should kill myself. Money problems ? I should kill myself  Don't know what I want to do in the future ? I should kill myself.   Not sure to pass this semester ? I should kill myself.  My thinking's blurry and I can't find a solution to a problem ? I should kill myself  I'm hungry and can't be arsed to cook something ? I should kill myself  I have a headache ? I should kill myself. Nobody's available to go out tonight ? I should kill myself  Someone I talked to looked bored ? I should kill myself  I lost in a random online game ? I should kill myself
I'm not going to say I feel great	the PAWs were absolute hell	 <e1> I'm not going to say I feel great </e1> ,  <e2> the PAWs were absolute hell </e2> , but  those subsided in about  a week and a half to two weeks for both of us.  The protracted withdrawals lasted quite awhile longer. . .  We are still experiencing gastrointestinal issues, but we have our appetite back.  I feel like we have the munchies lol.  We both lost like 25lbs in 2 weeks, but we've gained most of it back now.  I am pretty much over the worst part though, as is my girlfriend.  Just thought I'd share after both of us being strung out on opiates daily for over 10+ years.  It's a real bitch, but we are doing this.  So proud of her.  So proud of us.  :) Cheers!
I'm scared	I'll lose my job if I try to get help	I've been having more and more suicidal thoughts lately.  I don't have a plan yet but scared that this is turning into something out of my control.  I've always tried to convince myself that I'd be okay or that I was okay and I'm really not.  My husband will be devastated and I really don't want to do that to him.  I just feel like my life will end someday with me committing suicide.  I tried medication and it just isn't for me.  The worst part about this is that I can't pinpoint a reason on why I feel this way.   <e1> I'm scared </e1>   <e2> I'll lose my job if I try to get help </e2> .  I don't know what my goal is with posting this I guess maybe just to get my feelings out there.  Thanks for reading. 
the feeling is so terrible and nightmarish	I hate it	So recently I've been a bit stressed out from varsity work (basically finishing a degree I don't want to pursue a career in), starting a new part time job (which I love btw) and some family issues.  However I've notived these random occurances when I'm just chilling, it implodes in my chests, tightens a bit, I go a bit light headed and then my mind starts to think self apocolyptic thoughts, like what if I don't get a good job, health insurance, etc.  It never gets bad to the point were I have a break down and I can most often force it to go away, but  <e1> the feeling is so terrible and nightmarish </e1> ,  <e2> I hate it </e2> . 
I forgive it	it means no harm	Ya know somehow tonight I kinda had an epiphany.  Most of the time I want to kill my brain.  I want to take it out of my head and hit it with a hammer.  But really that would be no different than smashing a paralyzed man's legs with a hammer bc they don't work right.  My brain just doesn't brain right.  It's trying its best to help me and it's suffering alongside with me.  All the cells are full of stress and lacking serotonin and generally feeling awful trying to warn me of dangers.  It's in the same boat as I am.  And as much pain as it causes me  <e1> I forgive it </e1>  because  <e2> it means no harm </e2> .  It may not help me with OCD to realize this but it makes me less mad at my brain. 
I'm	time.	I'm just ashamed of my past.  Embarrassing things I've done or said.  I'm just ashamed of myself and who I am as a person.  I walk around everyday throughout everything I do with this feeling of pity about myself and I can't seem to shake it.  It's been a few years and even my neck is starting to form a slight bump from hanging my head down all the time.  
I	to.	I was arrested last week for suspicion of possession or distribution of images of children.  I am an online activist who shuts down kik groups and hack peoples Kik accounts who are known to trade these things online.  The police have siezed my phone and PC and it is being forensically analysed.  I am not into these things and I was only ever trying to do a good thing and stop these people.  I have given the police every detail into my activities and even 94 pages of accounts and passwords which we have taken.  Social services have been on the phone and I may not be able to see my unborn daughter until all of this is sorted.  I feel like the only way to end everyone else's stress and worry from this is to Kill myself.  The system and world is pushing me to it more and more.  What if I'm charged and prosecuted for being what it is I was trying to stop.  If I can't see my partner and daughter my life is over regardless.  So why not fulfill what this world has led me to. 
The	sobriety?	The Greek word paranoia means madness in general &amp; not the particular type of persecutory delusions. The noble &amp; exalted &amp; glorious state of paranoia cannot be described in words. The high level of imagination &amp; intelligence. . Docs, jealous of paranoids, prescribe meds. They cant imagine what colours &amp; sounds &amp; beauty &amp; poetic psychosis this mind can produce. This paranoid mind is natural LSD. Delusions of grandeur are just the natural state of grandeur of every free soul which enjoys its perfection. This madness is like the poetic inspiration of Blake: What saints &amp; prophets &amp; masters had when they were travelling in their celestial realms singing their religious ecstatic songs. Paranoia is intoxication &amp; dream-like state. Who could go back to dull sobriety?
I	too.	I guess I just wanted to say hello to the community.   I was diagnosed with a few personality disorders (borderline, dependant, avoidant) as well as major depression, anxiety, and PTSD last spring while in the military.   Though I didn't really pay too much attention to this at the time, I was more concerned with ending my life.   I've completed short DBT-based programs twice and started several others in between my hospital visits over the last year.   Currently I've stabilized and I'm starting a full 6 month DBT program at the VA, I'm trying to have high hopes that the skills stick this time. So. .  hello!  How are all of you holding up?  Anything you want to say to a newbie that you wish you knew?  Any advice for using skills?Also, my sister is diagnosed BPD and PTSD.   We get along. .  okay.   Any advice anyone has on dealing with BPD family members is great too. 
I have one bottle of water a day	I drink throughout the day to keep my mouth from drying up	I lost the woman of my dreams.   We had plans that were once in a life time.   They are shattered.   I'm 28 and she's the only woman ive ever let in enough to know about being raped at the age of 19. She thought I was continuously disconnected from her which I was, but not by choice.   I didn't want to be.   I didn't know how to handle her emotions while fighting my demons.   I couldn't. It's over, and I cannot go on. I haven't eaten in a week,  <e1> I have one bottle of water a day </e1>  that  <e2> I drink throughout the day to keep my mouth from drying up </e2> . I feel my body shutting down on me, my brains going crazy and I cannot block out the thought of just ending it all.   When it goes away it comes back a few hours later. The support group I have is my family and they don't understand. . . If I can't connect with someone I truly loved, how can I?
I began taking K	a back injury	Hey everyone, So before I began taking K, I was always in a good mood, no anxiety, and just an overall extraverted person.   <e1> I began taking K </e1>  for  <e2> a back injury </e2>  and just kinda kept going with it, for about a year, and here we are.  I see alot of people saying after being clean for a long time, they still feel depressed and anxious.  I feel like that now. .  my question is. . Do you think that I will go back to how I was once the withdrawals end? Would like to hear what you guys think and some personal experiences if possible.  Would really make me feel better to know that I'll go back to how I was, but lately seeing people here saying theyre still depressed so deep into it scares the living hell out of me.  Makes me think there's no hope. . 
I don't really live in a big city	although I've looked into it, I've only found things like national calls that are accessible to me	Just found this subreddit, sorry if I'm breaking any rules here.  I'm just wondering if anyone knows of any support groups/communities either online or how to find them locally?  <e1> I don't really live in a big city </e1>  so  <e2> although I've looked into it, I've only found things like national calls that are accessible to me </e2> .  I know there's a chat link for this subreddit but part of my OCD is also making me very uneasy about making an account for it because it looks sketchy (sigh). Only a couple people in my family know about my anxiety issues and lately I've just been feeling really sad and lonely about it because I'm too afraid of sharing with others around me
This	on	This is my first post here.  I am a pretty confused individual, and I have a question.  My parents were not quite as monstrous as many of the ones I read about here, but the more I learn about this, the more I see ACoN patterns in both myself and my brother.   I learned how to grey rock pretty early on
&gt;If	html)	&gt;If you are struck by the appearance of any promised pleasure, guard yourself against being hurried away by it; but let the affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay.  Then bring to your mind both points of time: that in which you will enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself after you have enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will be glad and applaud yourself if you abstain.  And even though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticing, and agreeable and attractive force may not subdue you; but set in opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a victory. Article 34 of the [Enchiridion]( mit. edu/Epictetus/epicench. html)
A	fine.	A quote I remembered reading somewhere on Reddit.  And it's so true.  I was talking to my therapist about it.  Even with my anti anxiety medication calming down the hectic noise in my head, I still have my Nrent's voices telling me all of my faults.  That I'm too sick, my husband will resent me, I deserve to be alone, I'm not smart enough, I'm not apologetic enough, I'm not pretty enough, I'm not good enough.  I'm not. . . . . enough.  I know it's not true.  My therapist wants me to acknowledge the good things I do every day, but it's so hard to drown out the angry voice of my father telling me that I look horrible in a skirt and my hair is dirty and messy and I obviously haven't combed it.  I can't remember to tell myself that I made a good meal when I have my mom's voice in my head pointing out all the mistakes I made while in the kitchen.  It's exhausting.  I know one day I'll have silence in my head.  I won't even remember their voices.  And that's what keeps me going.  I'm going to be free.  And I'm going to be fine. 
it didn't help	I'm usually taking a benzo or eat too much to compensate the stress	I take metylphenidate (retard) 30mg for 3 months now.  I have diagnosed ADHD, but to me it's mostly like an antidepressant.  It gives me a good mood, adds a lot to the motivation and makes me social, but after some hours I'm worn down and extremly nervous.  I've tried to take a little dose in the afternoon for a more smooth comedown, but  <e1> it didn't help </e1> .  So  <e2> I'm usually taking a benzo or eat too much to compensate the stress </e2> .  If I don't find a better way I'm afraid I have to discontinue it.  Any suggestions are welcome. 
Is	it?	Is it better to quit cold turkey or to wean yourself down to hardly smoking anything?I ask for the nausea symptom.  That's the only thing I struggle with really.  I won't cave from cravings or from insomnia or boredom, but I will cave from feeling nauseous literally 100% of the time.  I need help with this and am open to any advice.  Also, do you all eat a lot when you quit or do you struggle? Is it that you have no appetite, or that your nauseous? How do you handle it?
I've	tbh.	I've been sneaking pills every day from my parents so that i don't raise much attention, well not like they pay attention to me anyways, only when they have to tell me how disappointed in me they are.  I really hope this is the suicide attempt that finally kills me.   I've been attempting a lot in the past half a year, a bit more than half a year actually.  but tbh i dont even know if those can be called attempts. .  i dont even know why i did them.  i only had a couple of serious attempts, one kept me in bed for more than a week.   Huge part of me thinks i deserve to die actually.  I dont really know why im writing this tbh. 
1.	;P	1.  I haven't put my laundry away in about a month.  2.  Takes me 4 hours to do the dishes.  3.  I forget what I'm saying mid sentence 4.  I say the weirdest things (no filter) 5.  My mom starts sentences off with  Put  ____  down and look at me 6.   My boyfriend finds me doing laps around the house.  7.  It took me 2 hours to write this ;P**********Tell me some of yours ;P 
I'm going through a really ugly breakup	losing a lot of friends	I had left a long post on here a few days ago saying I was struggling and was hoping someone would reach out, but nobody did.  I tried getting a hold of my friends yesterday and they were all busy.  Or sometimes don't respond at all, even when I flat out say hey i need help.   <e1> I'm going through a really ugly breakup </e1>  and  <e2> losing a lot of friends </e2>  because of it. My mom left my family to go be a drunk a few months ago and now we have no contact.  I reached out for therapy a few weeks back
Does	another	Does anyone else feel that watching movies and TV shows and reading should also be avoided on the 90 day detox?To me, they can be lumped into the same group.  I'm on week two of my detox and just spent all day reading a book.  It was easy to notice the similar behavioral patterns when reading as when gaming.  Ex.  I skipped lunch and had to force myself to put the book down to eat much like when gaming. Edit: I feel like a person detoxing off video games and turning to books or tv is like a meth addict detoxing and turning to marijuana through the process.  Sure, it's not meth or other hard drugs, but the guy is still just moving from one crutch to another
I	pros.	I don't have the energy to type my story. I've always been fighting depression and suicidal thoughts, but never had the urge felt this strong. I'm weighing the pros and cons in my head, and the pros are winning over.  What am I forgetting? Someone, anyone, just please tell me the cons of suicide. Edit: thank you all so much for the support.  I remembered what I was forgetting, and I won't go through with it.  The cons outweigh the pros. 
I've been keeping it a secret	it just isn't acceptable to be depressed under my parents' roof	I've been pursuing my bachelor's degree gradually for a few years now and intend to stay at this pace despite my folks really getting into my head about getting up in age (im just 23?).  I hate college.  I hate it every inch of my body, and the pressure they put on me, constantly prodding, and never allowing me any other choices regardless of how little stress I can handle: makes my chronic depression worse.  <e1>  I've been keeping it a secret </e1>  because  <e2> it just isn't acceptable to be depressed under my parents' roof </e2> .  I'd get sent out to an asylum, and it's been threatened before when my mother had seen my cuts as a teen. Lol.  Asking me about when I plan on attending medschool? I'm dying before then.  I've left the girls who've asked me out, I've distanced myself from my peers, and it's the glass box that helps me sleep at night.  Sweet fucking release. 
I just wanna jump out of my skin	how disgusted I am with myself	Just wanna feel not alone for like a few minutes its overwhelming  <e1> I just wanna jump out of my skin </e1>  at  <e2> how disgusted I am with myself </e2>  as a being 
Hi	Thanks!	Hi everyone.  This is probably a really strange thing to post but I tend to get anxious if I'm uncomfortably full.  It doesn't happen all the time, but I ate something I didn't particularly like and now I'm full and feeling sort of anxious of how my body is reacting I feel kind of dizzy.  Should I take a benadryl just in case? Idk if its exhaustion or anxiety or even a food allergy but a pep talk would be appreciated. Thanks! 
That	.	That I'll feel happy again.  Feel like I have something to look forward to.  Have a positive outlook on my future/ career.  Get over the pain in my chest.  I just want to be ok again. . . . . 
I've had pretty bad anxiety and mediocre depression	I haven't been able to get any education or a job	 <e1> I've had pretty bad anxiety and mediocre depression </e1>  for the last ~8 years, and due to it  <e2> I haven't been able to get any education or a job </e2> .  It has also limited my social life, I have energy to see people for a few days in a week but I still have a lot of friends and in a way I'm happy in my situation. But I still decided to finally go and talk to someone about it when I have been having worse fears and stupid panic attacks (for example I easily get panic attack from looking at a clear sky
Even	Thanks.	Even if you know that you're being irrational, you get scared and anxious about your fears.  Instead of giving into the ocd and doing compulsions to control the obsessions, what do u do? Thanks. 
I sobbed in the shower	life	I was in the psych ward a month ago.  I'm still suicidal and always will be.  My husband means well by telling me what signs  showing that I am getting bad again, but all I hear is that I'm a piece of shit.  I have been fascinated by hangings lately, maybe due to media, who knows.  Last night, I decided I wanted to see if it would hurt.  I wrapped a tank top around my neck and pulled.  I tried it twice. . . the thing that bugged me the most was that I was looking into the mirror and could see my face turning purple.  Then  <e1> I sobbed in the shower </e1>  because  <e2> life </e2> .  I just want to feel okay again.  I'll settle for okay.  I don't even have to feel amazing. 
I	mentally.	I stood my ground, said what I needed to say.  I got beat up by a man twice my age and twice my weight, he had been trained in martial arts and I didn't throw a punch, my face is fucked up but I'm glad I didn't fight back.  I've seen the doctors and police but I don't know how well I'll recover mentally.  
I'm	better.	I'm too depressed and suicidal, I shouldn't have a dog to take care of.  I should get a pet rock.  But now she loves me and needs me. . .  I just want to die but I can't kill myself now.  A rock wouldn't mind though.  I thought I would have the strength to take care of my dog, but I'm not sure I do.  I know it's selfish but I only got a pet so I could get out of the house, I wouldn't go outside otherwise.  I just want to be in bed all day and sleep half of the day so I suffer less.  Taking care of her is the only thing I do, I don't work, most of time I don't even feel like cooking so I don't eat anything. . .  At least she always has her food and water.  She's a very happy dog and I'm a terrible depressed suicidal owner, she deserves better.  
Does	months	Does anyone have experience/advice being in a relationship, particularly with someone who doesn't have SA?I've been dating this guy [24M] for about 9 months, who's the complete opposite of me - outgoing, warm, thrives in social settings.  He loves meeting new people and is often invited out by friends/acquaintances.  He knows that I get worried and shy when meeting new people, but he doesn't truly get how insanely stressful it is for me.  We've even talked about living together in a few months
she's cheated death so many times	she can't take much more	In 2013 she got diagnosed with cancer and we're through that and she has the all clear however she's had some lingering issues.  In Feb she had some surgery and whilst it went okay there were complications after.  A nasty infection that left her thinking she was going to die, alone, in her hallway.  That got sorted but there is something that needs doing to finishing the job.  She's having the surgery tomorrow and I just have a feeling in my waters that it's not going to be okay and that she's going to die.  It's almost like  <e1> she's cheated death so many times </e1>  in recent years that  <e2> she can't take much more </e2> .  Anxiety is eating me up and I know I'm catastrophising but it really is the worst that can happen. Edit: everything went well.  Mum is fine and happy that things went well.   I'm hoping this is it now.  Thanks for the support. 
I naturally started freaking out	how awful it is for him	I get annoyed or straight up angry real quick.  Small things like not understanding a map or some software lagging can give me a physical feeling of something in my stomach.  I've known that being short-tempered is common for people who have been abused.  Not that I've known any other alternative to be. But one event opened my eyes very clearly at some point.  Once my boyfriend, a child of great parents, and I were having a lunch at a local fastfood place.  And before even starting to eat he spilled his whole drink on his pants.  In my head  <e1> I naturally started freaking out </e1>  about  <e2> how awful it is for him </e2>  and that I'm kinda glad it was not me.  If it was me I would be raging a bit, then irritated and in really bad mood that the pants are wet, the drink is gone, why does it always happen to me, I knew it I should have taken just the sandwich, etc.  Would loudly remember about it several times in a manner of omg it's so shitty that I spilled my drink
I've managed to somehow fuck things up for myself	end up giving myself social anxiety	Seriously, I remember being one of (if not the most) lively and energetic person in my group of friends, but ever since the last two years  <e1> I've managed to somehow fuck things up for myself </e1>  and  <e2> end up giving myself social anxiety </e2> .  There's nothing in this world I wouldn't give up to be my old self again; a confident
Quick	etc?	Quick background, I was diagnosed with depression at an early age.  I've been taking anti-depressants for a long time.  However, I think that some (if not most) of my depression might be sideeffects of my anxiety - which has either gotten worse over the past couple years or I'm noticing it more.  Anyways after many months of feeling down, I'm at a relatively high point right now but am feeling a bit overwhelmed with finding the right Dr to talk to and to discuss/prescribe different meds.  I really want to utilize this motivation, but quick googles make it seem rather complicated.  I'm in Michigan now, are there therapist here who can prescribe medication? Do I need to see two different doctors, and would this be a constant recurrence.  What ARE the differences between a Psychologist, Psychiatrist, etc?
Hey	happening	Hey guys. . So, I'm not sure if that's what they call magical thinking in the OCD terms.  There are times I have some intrusive thoughts about something bad happening.  OCD grabs the things I'm most afraid of and just projects these images/scenes into my brain.  Then, in order to stop them from happening
Just	Thoughts?	Just curious as to why Adderall isn't an option in the UK but dexedrine is available.  For the most part it's Adderall is 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levo. Just find this silly.  Thoughts?
I just wound up pouring into a glass and opted to save the rest for tomorrow	I was afraid of consuming more	Thought that I had a small enough amount of coffee earlier to safely take my second dose of the day after eating some food and -- nope, once it kicked in after twenty minutes or so, was sent on a trip straight to Anxiety City. Had some tea on hand that  <e1> I just wound up pouring into a glass and opted to save the rest for tomorrow </e1>  because  <e2> I was afraid of consuming more </e2> .  I'm not sure if the same likewise applies to Ritalin, but regardless, be very, very cautious if you opt to drink anything with caffeine in it.  The anxiety is just now beginning to wear off after a little over an hour. **TL;DR:** Amphetamine + Too much Caffeine = Getaway trip to Anxiety City. 
Sugary things tend to gross me out now	I need to dilute my juices	I've had a history of binging and starving, it eventually became binging and not binging, there was a binging and purging period as well (which I was very unpleasantly reminded of when my unusual method appeared in a show I'm watching). I've managed to get some degree of control by not coming off my adhd meds and keeping a mental tally of my calories consumed thus far each day.  I see the calorie value once, I have it memorized, and it's stopped me from eating certain foods altogether.   <e1> Sugary things tend to gross me out now </e1> , and  <e2> I need to dilute my juices </e2> . I've come from my peak weight to something better, but still overweight.  I go through periods of eating 1/4 what I should for where I want to be, periods of binging (eating above
I'm asking this question	Ive become suspicious that I might have ADHD	 <e1> I'm asking this question </e1>  because  <e2> Ive become suspicious that I might have ADHD </e2> .  I notice that when I try clean my room il start with my desk but my mind will drift and suddenly I'm cleaning my bed without finishing my desk.  Afterwards il begin cleaning my floor.  I end up doing multiple things at once.  I find it extremely hard to do one thing and focus on it. 
I'll	luck.	I'll have everything ready for my method of choice within a few weeks at most.  I've done the research and know exactly what my plan is.  I doubt I'll fail. Life just isn't fun anymore, and I don't care enough about anybody to stick through what I have no reason to believe could possibly end soon.  Either I have depression, which doesn't go away, or I'm just an unmotivated, overly-needy person who won't be satisfied with the type of life I'm capable of leading.  Either way, it's either decades of discontent or suicide.  I'm picking suicide.  Wish me luck. 
I	.	I know I'm not fun to be around but I feel stuck.  Sometimes I feel like I might be happy if I'm with friends but it's exhausting trying to be funny and even just trying to be part of the conversation.  I can barely keep up a texting conversation but I'm lonely.  I don't know what to do anymore. .  
Im	reading.	Im back again. Managed to quit for 12 months, and thought i could moderate my drinking at that point. 10 months on im drinking every night again till i pass out, sleeping all weekend and calling in sick to work.  Life is passing me by.  Today is day 2, been to the doc and after a couple days sleeping on the couch feeling anxious im ready to have another crack at this.  Got some valium to help the next week or two to get through the hard parts. Looking forward to getting on the wagon again.  That 12 months off drinking was both the most difficult and best year of my life, but i look forwsrd to being clear headed and motivated for life again. Thanks for reading. 
I'm	years	I'm 38.  When I was in my early 20's I was diagnosed with BPD plus major depressive disorder.  I checked off every box on the list of symptoms and enjoyed many hospitalizations.  In my early 30's the symptoms gradually began to decrease.  At this point the only symptoms I really notice much are impulsivity and occasional insomnia.  I still see a therapist regularly but don't need meds anymore.  I'm able to keep a job now.  I haven't had violent impulses in a long time.  I've been married to my current husband for 5 years
Being able to come home and work out, eating healthy	I wanted to reinforce the positive aspects of exercise	When I drank hard the next day I felt like death.  No surprise there.  So when I stopped drinking every night, it wasn't surprising that mornings felt better. What I didn't expect was the change in motivation that lasted throughout the day and into the night.   <e1> Being able to come home and work out, eating healthy </e1>  because  <e2> I wanted to reinforce the positive aspects of exercise </e2> . Well, I have been at it for a month now, and I am honestly shocked how quickly the bloat of alcohol [has left my face]( com/gallery/XxRAx). I am grateful for the support I have gotten from this sub and my friends and think that I will not be drinking with all of you for many nights to come. Cheers!
I fell down drunk last night outside of my child's door	This is embarrassing, scary, and serious	 <e1> I fell down drunk last night outside of my child's door </e1> .   <e2> This is embarrassing, scary, and serious </e2> .  I cannot just have one drink.  I cannot drink socially to blend in.  I have to stop.  I am embarrassing, mean, a gossip, and not gentle when I am drinking.  I do not want to be remembered this way. So day 1.  
I know that I don't have the kind of control it takes to drink in moderation	I'm still an alcoholic	Does anyone on here not like the word alcoholic? I struggle to use that word although I openly admit to not having the control to drink in moderation and have recently set myself down the path of life long sobriety. There seems to be so much stigma and permenance attached to this word that I find it really difficult to give myself such a label.  Once this label is stuck It seems to be incurable.  If I abstain from drinking for the next 20 years and don't ever plan to drink again, because  <e1> I know that I don't have the kind of control it takes to drink in moderation </e1> ,  <e2> I'm still an alcoholic </e2> .  I've heard the term recovering alcoholic but not a recovered one. Why is there not a term for someone that has total control of this condition by long term abstinence?
Y'allllllllll.	Spliffs	Y'allllllllll.  This is so hard.  I am on Day 4 of having no bud left, and while I threw away everything from the ashtray on Day 1, I'm on Day 0 of not FRANTICALLY SEARCHING EVERY CORNER, NOOK, AND CRANNY OF MY HOME for dropped roaches, hidden halfies, scraps of leaves, a little more tobacco, a little more bud, GOD PLEASE ANYTHING.  Rejoicing over disgusting half-burns makes me feel so low, but I did it anyway.  They all tasted awful, but I smoked them down anyway.  I think I've exhausted all potential sources of finding it.  I'm done looking anyway and can't think of anywhere else to look.  This is not how I intended to quit, but I'm trying to think of it as apering off and now I'm ready for the real deal.  I DON'T WANT IT.  I DON'T WANT IT.  I DON'T WANT IT.  Spliffs
Do	effective?	Do you guys find that going cold turkey is the best way to go? Or is every other day, then every 3, etc more effective? 
Literally	at.	Literally a rant sorry. I literally can't escape seeing people I don't want to see, it just makes everything feel so much worse than it already is.  People just have to post everything, whether I want to see it or not it comes up and back down my mood goes.  Try as I might I would love to avoid it but people care too much if you don't follow or whatever them, and all they do is complain about how shitty you are behind your back to others, and they wonder why I'm in such a mood all the time.  I don't see why I even bother sometimes, it just feels better if I wasn't around to meet them, I've only just known people for them to leave me anyway not like I matter to many anyway, must be nice having a big circle of friends that you can talk to and hang out with.  It's just making my brain hurt as to why I even think about having trusted people, I just want to not be there anymore, I don't want to show up to anything anymore, it's not worth the effort of being complained at.  
every time I'm not included in an outing for one reason or another	all those feelings feel true	I have a tight knit group of close friends who the rational me knows that they love and care for me.  But the paranoid depressed me is convinced they don't like spending time with me and don't like me.  I'm convinced that if there's a riff between us, I'll be the one exiled and alone.  And  <e1> every time I'm not included in an outing for one reason or another </e1> ,  <e2> all those feelings feel true </e2> . I also wrestle with the fact that I feel like I'm losing the enjoyment of my hobbies in order to try and like the things my friends like in order to fit in and remain friends and not feel left out.  Do I do the things that I like alone and feel lonely or do I do things I don't enjoy to have the company of others.  If i choose the first option, I feel like a selfish dick.  Just a rambling of feelings I struggle with.  Not sure if anyone else feels the same.  
I	sleep?	I slep a lil past 11 and woke up a lil past twelve, and then it was tossing and turning til 5 am.  I don't feel anxious but I know that being upset and the anxiety from that caused me not to sleep soundly.  Any advice on what to do when anxiety interferes in your sleep?
After	it	After I graduated college and started working for a large law firm in the IT department and went through a string of terrible managers who were either fired or quit I have social anxiety with bosses.  I'm always scared of losing my job and any criticism I see as confirmation that I'm going to lose my financial security.  My boss is awkward and it's hard carrying a conversation as it is.  I now work for a small company, only 7 employees.  It's so slow that my job as a receptionist is not needed right now.  The manager under the Boss told me the other day Speak louder on the phone like your job depends on it
Staying cautious	the cravings rear their head quite often at this point	A full 14 days wrapping up today.   Far from perfect but it is great to not require a drug just to function.   I'm actually enjoying spending time with my wife and kids, not just getting by until the next high.  <e1> Staying cautious </e1>  as  <e2> the cravings rear their head quite often at this point </e2> .   Before this I made it 43 days, so I'm trying not to fall into the same traps. I've been having a lot of stress at work (workplace drama with dumb people) which is causing a lot of anxiety but I'm finding different ways to cope with that. Anyways, for those of you in the first week, hang in there!  Each day is one step closer to feeling better.   And each day brings a little more calm and clarity to your life.   Keep fighting!
I	helps	I recently quit cold turkey after smoking just about every night for almost a year.  I have had problems with depression since I was 18 (I'm 21 now) but ever since I've stopped smoking the depression has been almost unbearable the past few days.  Is this common and any tips to get over it? I work out 5-6 days a week which definitely helps
And	guys.	And for those who have managed to quit for a good period of time, what was it that finally made you stick to being sober?I've relapsed many times over the years and I'm so sick of it and afraid it's going to happen again.  Longest I've been sober is about a month. Edit: Thanks for your input guys. 
I couldn't ever get comfortable, I always wanted to move around	I felt irritated in one position	I was on day 6 of quitting oxy, and I dropped a half tab of 1P-LSD (approx 70 ug).  I had a nice mentality and all, listening to music, watching stuff outside etc, but the physical side of it was very harsh.    <e1> I couldn't ever get comfortable, I always wanted to move around </e1>  cause  <e2> I felt irritated in one position </e2> , and now I even got a headache on the right side of my head.  Not bothering me too much, but since I have no means to get either any basic analgesic, imma have to wait it out.   Any similar experiences? 
i used marijuana	it made me happy day to day	As dumb as it simply is  <e1> i used marijuana </e1>  because  <e2> it made me happy day to day </e2> , even when I wasn't high I was happier when I was smoking somewhat consistently.  My girlfriend doesn't look on it fondly and I want to stop for her, but the only thing is now I'm sad all the time again instead of occasionally, and it's coming out whereas I used to keep it under wraps for the most part.  Anyone know any other hobbies I can pick up that can just give me something to look forward to at the end of the day? That's really what I need
I	therapist.	I happen to be in a bad mood, sometimes accompanied by anger, sometimes not, but when I start building hope the next day I think I'm not depressed anymore and fall back into the rabbithole.  Makes me procrastinate a lot.  Doesn't help it's getting harder and harder to maintain said hopes. What the hell is this shit, I'm sometimes so confused I don't even feel like going to my therapist. 
There is no money to continue my studies	the only thing I can see is to end it all when my family leaves for vacation in about a week and a half	In the last year my life has gone to hell.  I lost all my friends, I dropped out of University, after 5 years of studies, and I started lying to everyone that stayed in my life, mostly family.  Thing is, after all this time, I just can't see anything I could do.  I tried looking for a job, but got no replies.   <e1> There is no money to continue my studies </e1> . So  <e2> the only thing I can see is to end it all when my family leaves for vacation in about a week and a half </e2> . I just screwed up my life, and even though I've been trying to fix it for the last month and change, there is nothing that can be done anymore.  It just feels so. . .  Hopeless.  I don't even feel sad about it anymore.  It's just how it is.  I feel like it's the logical and unavoidable conclusion. 
Maybe	thing	Maybe this stupid worthless body that I am deserves some respect but I just don't care anymore.  Treat me poorly,I'll get mad but ultimately I don't care, everything's gonna end sometime.  I'm a bad girlfriend, student, waitress and intern.  Busy all the time but bad at everything.  Stupid fuckin existence thing
they told someone I'm also close with to not transition	their old abuser was also a trans man	tw:transphobia towards trans men only, suicidal ideation mentionhi! I have a friend with bpd and they did something really wrong.  like, really, really wrong.  them and their spouses both think they were in the right and they've asked me to confirm.  basically  <e1> they told someone I'm also close with to not transition </e1>  because  <e2> their old abuser was also a trans man </e2> .  the thing is they're really unstable this time of year and I don't know how to tell them what you did was super shitty without throwing them into a suicidal mindset.  I honestly don't want to be friends with them anymore because of it(I'm not they're fp so that's not much of a problem) but I'd like some advice on how to say that without hurting them to badly.  like I said
Just	again.	Just a reminder friends, hunger is almost an impossible trigger.  And yet so easy to prevent!We have to look after ourselves.  As soon as you feeling a bit hungry, address it, snack, whatever.  Don't let it get worse.  I just had a close call - but glad I have worked out another trigger before I fell.  Won't make that mistake again.  
I ran into the next-door neighbour when I left my apartment today after basically fighting her	a few days ago letting me my door close	I guess this is a follow-up to my two previous posts [link]( reddit. com/r/CPTSD/comments/6s0956/setting_boundaries_again_and_then_there_is_the/) and [link]( reddit. com/r/CPTSD/comments/6s54c5/that_is_part_of_how_my_freeze_feels_today/)I want to thank you all here for the support you showed in the two other posts - and in general on this subreddit, of course.  It was a tremendous help.  I want to share with you the unexpected outcome of all the hardship I have been through again during the last days with the freeze, anxiety, shame, hyperarousal, you name it.  Today  <e1> I ran into the next-door neighbour when I left my apartment today after basically fighting her </e1>  SO  <e2> a few days ago letting me my door close </e2>  (he insulted me as well, is much bigger) and after reporting him with the police and throwing them a leave me alone/ no contact me evr again or else - cease and desist letter in their mailbox.  A few days ago when her SO threatened me she was standing there
yea	turkey?	yea so i'm 15 and i've been smoking every day for about 4 months multiple times a day.  i haven't expierence any problems directly related to my marijuana consumption.  i want to quit but i have nothing to do all day and i think about smoking all the time .  it's hard to sleep without weed and it's hard to have fun without it.  i don't exactly want to stop but i need advice on how i can quit for a little while and let my head clear up.  any tips or advice on how to quit cold turkey?
I'm	ideas?	I'm getting very shaky and feelings of straight up fear after being on 8mgs buprenorphine a day for 2 months.  I don't understand it.  Nothing has changed with my meds except for the bupe.  I've been doing everything I can to reduce stress but this feels different and uncontrollable.  I'm in recovery for Kratom and opiates and this feeling almost feels like I'm in withdrawals.  Anyone have any ideas?
It's	it.	It's my first day out of bed in five days and I don't know if it's temporary but I feel this morning I turned a leaf and got at least a momentary reprieve from my grief.  I wrote the stuff below to keep close, to remind myself to be at peace with the way I'm feeling.  Maybe someone can relate.  Peace. Your memories, no matter how painful they appear now, are nothing but a testament to your capacity to love and to share.  Wounds will heal.  Do not ever feel ashamed of loving too much or giving too much.  If everyone did the same, the world would be a much nicer place.  Love with unabashed abandon.  Your heart is made for it.  
if I do	I'll have to live out my worthless, hopeless life again and do the same mundane things	Because  <e1> if I do </e1> ,  <e2> I'll have to live out my worthless, hopeless life again and do the same mundane things </e2> .  Life is not worth living! 
Don't be afraid of change	if you are, you will never see success in life or recovery	Quit because you want to.  Change your life.  Don't look back.   <e1> Don't be afraid of change </e1>  because  <e2> if you are, you will never see success in life or recovery </e2> .  You have the power to beat this, believe in yourselves!
I wasn't doing anything to build a safety net for myself	I want to give it my all	Hi friends.  Yesterday was my first relapse.   <e1> I wasn't doing anything to build a safety net for myself </e1> , so this time  <e2> I want to give it my all </e2> .  I want to go to meetings starting tomorrow and I have told my husband and some family members I have a problem and I am quitting.  My question is, do all the AA meetings just do 12 steps, or can you choose, or what? I'd love to hear a run down on the 2 programs.  I've done a bit of research, but it's nice to have my online community's opinion.  I ordered The Naked Mind, The BB, and 12 steps and traditions from Amazon today.  Any other studies that are working for y'all would be appreciated.  Stay strong, SD crew! 
Doing	already.	Doing labor for free all day unappreciative jerks. Found an empty powder drug baggie in the empty lot next to where I live. Shatter unbreakable drinking glass on to the floor in the dark with no shoes or socks.   Bloody toe. Fucking today just end already.

I hate my life	It's so empty without the love of my life in it	There are two reasons why I haven't made a suicide plan. . . yet.  1) I have at least $ 30k of debt (including my new at the time car)  and I don't want to saddle my parents with that.  2) I'm a pussy and I don't like pain.  I know there are ways around number 2.  Number 1 is the biggest at this point.   <e1> I hate my life </e1> .   <e2> It's so empty without the love of my life in it </e2> .  
It's disturbing	despite my career and stability, I am still getting nightmares about her	I've been NC with my Nmom for almost three years.  It hasn't stopped her from pushing boundaries, although when I wen't off at her she stopped sending me text messages.  I still get really bad dreams about her, where she has made elaborate arrangements to punish me for whatever reason.  The theme is common: the punishment has been arranged, relatives such as my aunt and father disapprove but will not stand up to her, I find out from sympathetic people that she has set me up and then I run away.  When she finds out I have run away she sets up a manhunt where I am hunted down like a rabbit.  <e1> It's disturbing </e1>  because at my age (41) and  <e2> despite my career and stability, I am still getting nightmares about her </e2> .  The person she is now can't hurt me and has no influence over me.  She certainly can't beat me or punish me anymore.  I'd appreciate your experiences or ideas about how to deal with nightmares. 
I texted a crisis line I've used	my overwhelming urges to slit my arm open and/or hang myself	 <e1> I texted a crisis line I've used </e1>  (and had a good experience with) before at 11:52 PM due to  <e2> my overwhelming urges to slit my arm open and/or hang myself </e2> .  At 11:53 the bot says We're getting a live Crisis Counselor for you.  This may take a minute.  It's now 12:22 AM and I still haven't gotten a response.  Didn't even tell me due to high volume of responses. . .  or anything.  I'm so fucking done with this shit.  Edit: At 12:39 AM I finally got a Crisis Counselor.  After 45 minutes.  God damn it.  
I think that sort of stuff is stupid	I now loath myself which is just even more of a burden	I can't remember the last time I laid down at night and didn't worry about something, It seems like my nights have always been like this and I really can't remember a time I didn't lay awake thinking or worrying I actually wonder if I've just always been this way.  I like to tell myself that one day I'll solve all my problems and sleep peacefully, but in the back of my mind I just feel like it'll go on like this forever.  The same old pain day in and day out.  I think that things like cutting yourself, hitting yourself or killing yourself was stupid but sometimes I find myself punching my leg or thinking about how I could just finally run away from my problems by ending it all.  Because  <e1> I think that sort of stuff is stupid </e1>   <e2> I now loath myself which is just even more of a burden </e2> .  I feel like it's selfish to feel this way but not matter what I can't help it.  I know there is people who care about me but I really don't think anyone understands or could help me. 
I	suicidal.	I have been going through an incredibly stressful time and have been having a lot more fits lately.  I have also been suffering from audio and pretty intense visual hallucinations.  I always get really discouraged when I can't control my mind.      I have bad insomnia and I would really like some one to talk to at night.  The night is the worst for me.  When I am all by myself in the dark, I get suicidal.  
so	do)mother	so as I discovered my mother was a narc I went low contact.  I didn't try and set any boundaries I would just ignore/ghost her.  now I want to get rid of one thing that connects us - her stuff at my place.  she has approximately a whole room of things here.  I want to send a clear message that this is not okay with me. I was thinking sending her a text (so I'm not caught JADEing over the phone which I tend to do)mother
I decided to quit	I recently made a huge decision	Hello everybody I have been debating quitting for a While now and just reading this subreddit has been inspiring.  I have been using kratom for two years ( I quit once ct last year for a couple months. )  <e1> I decided to quit </e1>  because  <e2> I recently made a huge decision </e2>  to take a huge pay cut to further my education and  life couldn't be better; furthermore I didn't want my kratom addiction to hold me back.  As of now , I just got of work at about 3a. m and I couldn't sleep at all .  I have a full day of interning then class in the evening with work following that over night .  It's gonna be a tough day , but I MADE a decision and I'm not turning back now.  Thank you everybody for creating this awesome community , it really does make a lot of people hopeful . 
I try to have this persona as a hard and cold and generally unfeeling person	I'd rather just not deal with it	I've always known one of my most pronounced personality flaws is jealousy.  That combined with my need for acceptance and an inferiority complex. . . . it hasn't been easy.  Well, these tend to rear their ugly head in the form of anger and impatience.  If I were to psychoanalyze myself (which i'm in no way qualified to do, btw) I'd say it's a defense mechanism.   <e1> I try to have this persona as a hard and cold and generally unfeeling person </e1>  because  <e2> I'd rather just not deal with it </e2> .  People I love tend to be the victims of my anger.  I'm honestly just mean sometimes.  And I don't really know what to do anymore. I recently started therapy for my social anxiety (see: inferiority complex) but I honestly don't feel like it's helping.  I have such a hard time admitting to myself how I feel, let alone other people.  At this point, I don't feel like progress is a possibility.  I kind of just felt the need to vent.  I don't even expect any replies.  Thanks for reading.  
Everything	die.	Everything is wrong with my so called life.  Misery, poverty, hopelessness, family woes, being alone all the time.  All feel unsolvable despite me having done everything correctly and right growing up.  Each day I wish was the last.  Yet I don't even have it in me to put an end to my miserable existence.  All I can do is hope that I luck out and die.  
I know it's not an affect from cold meds	I don't usually take any cold meds, more often than not because I forget	This has been pretty consistent for me all my life.  I study/work slowly (which is still more progressive than a distracted day) and it's annoying that I have to sit upright and do things I don't want to when I can't breathe or hear properly, but the cold symptoms are like background white noise that help me stay on task and be productive without any of the regular restlessness (due to drained energy levels).  I'm even singularly motivated by the need to finish so I can lie down in peace. Too bad it only lasts 1-2 days and I never get sick when I could really use this.   <e1> I know it's not an affect from cold meds </e1>  because  <e2> I don't usually take any cold meds, more often than not because I forget </e2> .  Although now that I'm thinking about it, I wish I had some sinus meds on me now. Anyone else?
I actually feel at peace	I'm in control of ending my own suffering	I've already picked out a date before the year ends and I actually feel very at peace with my decision, as well as relief knowing that I won't be tortured with horrible depression every single day.  I've suffered from horrible depression since I was 13, therapy and drugs never helped me at all, and now I'm at a point where I can't even afford it anyways.  My family doesn't want to have anything to do with me, all of my old friends have moved away or have new lives and have cut off contact.  the only good thing I had was a relationship that ended a couple months ago, and the breakup really fucked me up mentally, and I know I will never feel better.  I know no one else will want to date or associate with me and I'm just done with trying.  My life doesn't have a meaning and there is really no other reason for me to be here.  I just waste people's time and resources and take up space.  For once in my life  <e1> I actually feel at peace </e1>  knowing that  <e2> I'm in control of ending my own suffering </e2> . 
Seriously considering just going back to smoking despite being determined	I don't want the stress to kill me and hurt my relationships too bad	I never thought it was going to be this bad.  I used to smoke pretty regularly but not ridiculous.  Maybe an eighth a week tops.  I always knew it hindered a lot of aspects of my life and I would quit sometimes but eventually come back writing off quitting as stupid as my withdrawals weren't really that bad.  Finally I bought my first ounce to 'sell' on the side and started smoking way more.  After that, I stopped on a dime.  I'm 2 weeks in, with 1 small relapse, and my insomnia and depression are both killing me.  My depression is really scaring me though, suicidal thoughts are coming up from really diagnosing the point of life and thinking how people live they're day to day is really pointless and I'm really scared.  I love my family even if I feel like a retard to them and I don't want to hurt them.  Is this going to get better? Has anyone had a similar experience with a success story?  <e1> Seriously considering just going back to smoking despite being determined </e1>  because  <e2> I don't want the stress to kill me and hurt my relationships too bad </e2> . 
If	bottle.	If I have a half bottle of water and I shake it really hard so that it makes bubbles, I am then disgusted to drink it.  I imagine someone drank it and then spit it back into the bottle.  
So	this.	So I've been kind of sick for the past couple of days and it's made me have so much more time to obsess over things and just lay there exTREMELY anxious and scared. It starts with North Korea (I'm not even in the United States), it then goes to health anxiety and why I'm feeling so bad (not congested, I'm a bit nauseous and extremely exhausted and my eyes feel very warm.  People say it's gonna be a cold but I'm not sure and I obsess over it and become terrified about it).  I then thought that I was poisoned with cyanide and was slowly dying, i've been very conscious about how pale I look these days to see if I'm dying.  NOW I can't look out the window or through my door and I feel like there is somebody outside waiting or looking at me with a gun or something and I'm HORRIFIED,  i AM PANICKING and all I want to do is cry, yet I can't cry for some reason. I hate this. Now I'm laying in bed exhausted, feeling a little bit sick and panicking. When will this enddd??? I will so tell my therapist about this. 
.	panicking.	. . .  and I'm dreading it.  I've looked forward to moving to a dorm room, out of this hell hole I've lived in all my life, with my nightmare parents.  Hell, they're still bugging me about those damn passwords (I'm on mobile and don't know how to link posts, but it's in my history).  But I'm still so anxious to leave.  I've only ever been the child of narcissistic parents.  I dont know any other life and god knows they haven't prepared me for anything else.  I'm scared shitless I'm going to fail in college, I'm scared to leave my parents' home.  It's ridiculous.  They abuse me, they expect me not to react in any way to stress, they put me down every single day. . .  and yet I'm so scared to move to a much better, safer environment.  These feelings aren't fair.  I should be exhilarated.  But instead I'm panicking.  
I've	system	I've been obsessed most of the summer with a memory of a woman who shared stolen glances with me last spring most days on a campus shuttle.  I'll be looking out for her this fall and have been looking forward to the opportunity to actually talk with her.  When I have some manic upswings I end up getting a little obsessive about what we could be poetry helps me kind of get it out of my system
It's just become the thing that I do	I don't know what else to do	Hello everyone.  I discovered this subreddit recently and decided to make an account participate a little bit.  I've been gaming for a long time and I've come to realise that it is serving no purpose for me anymore.   <e1> It's just become the thing that I do </e1>  because  <e2> I don't know what else to do </e2> . I decided to make a list of reasons why I want to stop gaming: - I impulse buy games on Steam, waste money, and never play them - I become angry and frustrated when gaming then say and do things that I regret - gaming isolates me - gaming prevents me from discovering new hobbiesAnyway, I'm giving it a go. 
The	listening	The last time I saw my mom alive was my 21at birthday. She killed her self two weeks later. She was 48. I recently found out her father (my grandpa) killed himself when he was 52. I'm 38 today and although I'm not suicidal or struggling as bad as others I'm definitely in pain.   I have no love in my life.   A dead end job that most likely i can only do for another two years.  Plus this weird feeling my family tradition is inevitable and realistically I'm enter the final 12 years or so of lifesanity. Thanks for listening
Sorry if this has already been asked	I couldn't find it with the search function	Hello !  <e1> Sorry if this has already been asked </e1> ,  as  <e2> I couldn't find it with the search function </e2> .  I'm just really curious as to how you would react if a GC apologized to you. Would it make you feel better ? Would it be too little too late ? Would it even matter ?
How	effects?	How long should my cold shower be? I was reading 5 minutes is the approximate time for the most beneficial effects?
So	trigger	So I've decided to go to college and asked my doctor for add medication to help me focus.  She was very very worried about me considering I have such a severe case of anxeity and depression caused by ptsd.   I started taking the medication aboiut a week ago (it's a daily one, not as needed)  and I've had such a surprising reaction. . .  It's almost as if it cured my ptsd. . .  the week before I would start bawling when I encountered a trigger
In	everyone!	In my fucking dream! To me, that's a testament to how sad and fucked up porn addictions are.  I actually had a wet dream in which I *fucking watched porn*.  My brain is so conditioned into watching porn that when it's dreaming, it would rather dream up a scenario where I'm **watching porn** instead of dreaming up a scenario where I'm having the real thing. It's hilariously fucked up to me. . .  Like what the fuck? You'd think my brain would come up with actual sex in a wet dream. . .  But my subconscious clearly preferred porn over the real thing. Thankfully I still haven't watched porn IRL and my streak is still going strong.  Fuck this porn addiction.  We're better than this!Stay strong everyone!
I	relate?	I want to express myself in social media but I always psych myself out and delete my post right before I hit send.  Sometimes if I'm brave I'll just hit send but then I'll immediately over analyze how people may interpret my message, worry that I offend somebody or just in general fear the permanency of that post being out in the internets foooorrrrreeeevvvveeerrrrr.  I want to share my life and all the cool things I experience but why is this such a struggle? It's an internal debate.  I wish I could just post freely but I get uncomfortable and clam up.  I am a little more open on my Snapchat but that's mostly because it's my super close tribe and also just random people I don't know.  Anyone else relate? 
Please be sure to include any effects on your weight	it is one thing I'm really anxious about	Hello. First of all, I want to say that I'm very proud of everyone who has gotten help and tried antidepressants, therapy, anything really.  I know that it's hard to do. I'm going to be meeting with my physician to talk about getting on antidepressants soon, and I wanted to know people's experiences with them.  How did they make you feel? Did they work? What was your dosage? Any side effects? How long have you been taking them?  <e1> Please be sure to include any effects on your weight </e1> , since that  <e2> it is one thing I'm really anxious about </e2> . Thank you for your time and help.  If anyone ever wants to talk, they can send me a message as well.  I like to listen. 
I've	it	I've already polyurethaned four cabinet doors, am tidying up, drinking iced coffee and listening to NPR. My biggest stressor is. .  is there enough time today to get everything done that I want to do?To anyone starting their Sunday with a hangover, feeling crappy, regretful.   I was you.   If you have been worried about your drinking, wishing something would change but nothing ever does.   Just.  try.  it.   Go one week.   After one week you can drink 10 million beers.   Today can be the day you decide hat's it
i took an official iq test when i was a little boy and scored well above average	i don't think i am stupid	I also posted on r/socialskillsI struggled with social anxiety all my life but I've made some significant progress and happy with the results.  Lately I've been on some assertiveness training and seeing its results. I speak my mind a lot, i gained a lot of confidence and don't hold my opinions for myself anymore. However, when i speak my mind; give my detailed opinion on a subject/choice/decision, i feel people don't like it, they look at me funny or don't respond for a long time then respond with a weird attitude. By people i mean people i know, my friends, peers etc.  Not strangers.  Whether it's just they don't like me speaking my mind or I'm stupid(which sometimes i do feel stupid but  <e1> i took an official iq test when i was a little boy and scored well above average </e1>  so  <e2> i don't think i am stupid </e2> , still there's always a possibility) or they think I'm being stupid and i say weird things or I'm just being paranoid, i don't know.  I feel like we're missing on communication when i speak my mind clearly they don't respond clearly enough or they hide some things. Can anyone relate? How should i deal with this?
I've	Thanks	I've felt like this for a while now and I don't know what to do.  The problem is that I don't want to do anything.  All kind of work, no matter how important it would have felt a few months ago, now seems pointless to me.  I've ended up spending all my time playing games, watching films and TV shows, not because I enjoy them but just to pass the time.  I think I am depressed but am really not sure.  I've talked to a few people about this and they seem to think that I am.  Either way I would really value anyone's input.  Thanks
I've been on both sides of this cautious communication dance before	your story stayed in my thoughts all day	I don't know if you saw my comment before deleting your post, but [here it is in case you missed it]( reddit. com/r/rapecounseling/comments/6t8t60/am_i_alone_in_this_is_this_common/?st=J6B2YETY&amp;sh=e4739f80).  Your post was literally deleted while I was responding to you.  And  <e1> I've been on both sides of this cautious communication dance before </e1> , so of course  <e2> your story stayed in my thoughts all day </e2> .  I just want to make sure you know that you should be proud of yourself for moving forward and getting the help that you need to holistically heal after your incidents.  My heart goes out to you.  I can't imagine what it would be like to be ignored my by SO during an event.  
If the argument gets too out of hand I automatically start to self harm	I know he'll stop fighting and try and comfort me	To start off. .  I'm doing so much better.  I can really see progress now and it's amazing, but I still go back into my rage modes sometimes when things get difficult.  Typically it starts with my SO doing something that pisses me off (real or imagined).   <e1> If the argument gets too out of hand I automatically start to self harm </e1>  because  <e2> I know he'll stop fighting and try and comfort me </e2> .  It's so messed up because I'm aware of what I'm doing.  I don't want to hurt myself anymore but it's like I turn into a desperate animal that will do anything it can to get what it wants.  Does anyone else struggle with using self harm as a method of control? How do I stop this?
constant	letdown	constant anxiety mixed with depression I am weak and never have gotten help or told anyone in my life apart from people I barely know that i wont see again or internet strangers. I think theres something wrong with my brain that makes me think this way but I'm too weak to fight a battle to get myself right and live out life , a life that may be good or bad or ok.  I don't care which it is its just too complex and I cant understand anything and don't think I want to try anymore. nothing makes sense to me and I cant rationalise or explain anything and I know I will be hurting people by doing it and I'm so sorry for it but I'm not happy anymore and I'm selfish and a scumbag and a letdown
Just	help?	Just at that overly emotional point in my depression where I feel like I am the problem and people would really rather I just go off somewhere to die and stop bothering them with my sad mood.  Suppose im wondering if others feel like everyone else just thinks it's a ploy for attention and not a plea for help?
Hey	Goodnight	Hey everyone, Depressed yet again on everyone's favorite time, Sunday night. And as I use music to fuel my depression I often listen to reasonably sad or close to home hitting songs during this time, but I don't really have a lot. That's where you guys come in, any suggestions? Anything honestly, but if it helps I like classic rock and things relating to my parents ongoing divorce from 12 years go get me every time ;).  Please share yours too, even if unrelated, I'd like to see how others cope. Thanks and Goodnight
~~Pain	alive.	~~Pain is only going to keep coming.  There's no reason to keep experiencing it.   I have no one.  And if I did, they'd eventually hurt me. ~~Edit: I really REALLY appreciate the comments and concern.  It doesn't make me feel as lonely as before.  I am so glad you guys took the time and effort into reassuring me that there are people that want me alive. 
I'm	future.	I'm writing a number of notes.  One for my family, one for my boyfriend, and one for each of my best friends.  Four notes in total.  I don't think I'm going to try anything now, I'm generally too much of a pussy to attempt my life.  I'm not really depressed or anxious for once.  I'm just numb.  I think I'm doing this as a way to cope.  Or maybe so I have something if I ever decide to do anything in the future.  
I have also been extremely nervous leading up to my first day	I was really in my own head	Hi everyone.  I feel embarrassed posting about this at all but it's been eating me up all day.  I have longterm anxiety and depression issues that can at times be debilitating, but have improved over the past couple of years. I had my first day at a new job today, which is in a building on a university campus.  It's a really good fit and all around great job, so I've felt really happy and excited that things are looking up.   <e1> I have also been extremely nervous leading up to my first day </e1> , so  <e2> I was really in my own head </e2> . Today I walked across campus to get to my building, and noticed some people sitting on some steps I needed to use to get where I was going.  I registered they were sitting and talking, but just kept walking through to get up the stairs.  One of them was talking more animately, but then went quiet as I walked past.  He said something like Well thats. . . .  but otherwise silence
Hi	anymore	Hi everyone,Im 17 years old and only a month ago my father passed away.  I thought giving it time would make the pain more bearable and that i would be able to continue with my life.  Its been a month and i feel the same if not worse than the day he passed away.  Ive struggled with depression before and this has come so close to pushing me over the edge.  The only thing stopping me is my mother and the thought of how sad she would be if i did indeed commit suicide.  Im not sure why im posting this here, just. .  i dont even know how i can carry on anymore
Hey	affirmation.	Hey reddit,need some advice on why it happens/how to manage feeling these fleeting feelings of tense anxiety and (i think jealousy/envy???) when i see a trigger, be it a peer who is experiencing a form of success in one way or another. I feel crippled with anxiety often when this happens and I dont know how to start to think my way out of it.  How do I develop patterns to combat this response so that it no longer happens.  I do not want to ever feel this way with people; i wan't to feel happy for them, positive, i want to lift them up.  i don't want t feel as though I have to one-up or compensate them with any sort of positive affirmation. 
Also,	otherwise.	Also, I don't know how to tell my husband that I'm struggling with these thoughts.  They're worse in the mornings, where I fantasize about jumping off of a short building or stepping in front of a car, or a new idea last night was taking just enough pills to get sick but not too much to actually die.  At what point does ideation become a true danger to self? I'm a little afraid my husband will freak out if I tell him, and drag me to the ER.  I've been keeping my therapist and psychiatrist in the loop, though, and we're trying to manage it otherwise.  
I've	do?	I've been more honest with her than I thought I would, but there's still one thing (that's important) that I just don't think I can bring up.  And I think it might be a part of my social anxiety.  One part of me that I absolutely *hate* is my voice.  I can't properly pronounce certain words (anything that starts with an 'r' especially).  And apparently I have an accent.  I've had people mention my accent and how they can't understand what I just said to them *hundreds* of times.  I'm so embarrassed of it that I don't know if I can bring it up to her.  What am I supposed to do? 
I'm	reading.	I'm a 21M and I suffer from ADHD and Depression/Anxiety.  I feel like a fucking child all the time.  Everything I say or even think seems so childish and people treat me as such.  I feel like a man child and have gotten so self hating about it that I've been suicidal for a while.  Is this the ADHD? Is this the social anxiety combined with it? Is this just who I am? I feel like I've made no progress and I feel so alone in this.  Thanks for reading. 
I'm	outcomes	I'm a couple weeks into CPT (cognitive processing therapy) at a trauma center and so far I think it's really stupid tbh.  Not trying to be difficult, I just think that worksheets alking back to my thoughts are silly and I end up just using them to reinforce my negative thoughts anyway.  My therapist said that people who come into therapy feeling hopeful have faster/better outcomes
Decided	afterward	Decided enough is enough.  Did not go and buy the usual bottle of wine or the liter of beer.  It feels good.  I was so afraid of what would happen when I stopped drinking but nothing happened.  I am the same old me, except clear-minded and not regretting getting tipsy like I usually do.  Looking forward to a good night of sleep afterward
I'm curious about this	due to my anxiety disorder I sometimes have times of extremely high anxiety that can build for days if I don't take anxiety meds and I worry that the anxiety might trigger another episode	Do chronic anxiety disorders often co-exist for people with schizoaffective? If so, does the heightened anxiety pose a threat of triggering an episode?History: Diagnosed with schizoaffective two years ago (still not convinced I have it) I live medication free (aside from my take-as-needed anti-anxiety meds) and have a decent career.  I have had major anxiety since I was around 19 (panic disorder, OCD, generalized anxiety). I have had 3 psychotic episodes, each lasting around 2 to 4 months at ages 19, 27, and 36.  They all came on very quickly, seemingly for no reason other than I was very anxious and stressed before each one.   <e1> I'm curious about this </e1>  because  <e2> due to my anxiety disorder I sometimes have times of extremely high anxiety that can build for days if I don't take anxiety meds and I worry that the anxiety might trigger another episode </e2> . I'm also curious how common it is for other people with schizoaffective to have anxiety disorders as well. Thanks for your responses. 
It was such a foreign feeling to me	whenever my mom would see me, I'd be drunk	I decided to pay my mom a visit during my lunch break.  It's been the first time I've seen her since I've stopped drinking.  I walk in and she comments that I've lost weight.  I told her of my decision to stop drinking and she gives me the biggest hug ever. I spent my hour lunch eating some of her delicious cooking over good conversation.   <e1> It was such a foreign feeling to me </e1>  because  <e2> whenever my mom would see me, I'd be drunk </e2>  and she would go off on a lecture about how I'm killing myself; me being drunk during said lectures, I would go off on her about how it's my life blah blah blah. It felt so good to be able to formulate complete sentences with a completely clear mind.  I can't remember the last time she told me that she was proud of me but it feels so fucking good. 
That's so nice	the rest of the time I can't seem to want anything strongly enough, for long enough, to get it done	Just a weird realization I had the other day.  First I had to realize I actually enjoy feeling compelled to do whatever it is I'm drawn to at the time (information addiction has replaced about a decade of my life, but there are a couple of other things too).  Feeling that gnawing hunger to consume makes me feel excited and alive.  Then I realized I so rarely feel motivated to chase anything the rest of the time that my compulsions sort of make me feel productive.  I want something, and I'm chasing it!  <e1> That's so nice </e1> , because  <e2> the rest of the time I can't seem to want anything strongly enough, for long enough, to get it done </e2> .  Yeah, depression's been in the picture, but it's more than that.  I'm finally happy the majority of the time these days, which has made it obvious what a chasm there is between what I say I want and what kind of concrete steps I can manage to kick myself into taking to get there. 
it felt quite right	this exchange eventually ended when she hit me	A year ago, about this time, I told my n-mother the truth that I just *don't* care about her feelings anymore.  I had never thought about it like that until I said it, and  <e1> it felt quite right </e1>  because  <e2> this exchange eventually ended when she hit me </e2> .  The next morning her only apology to me telling her in tears to never hit me again and that I was sorry for saying I don't care was, You just made me *so* mad.  I still don't care if she's mad.  That's her fault by that point.  It's her problem if she's angry
till i finally quit	how badly they interfered	my parents did a number of mental and physical abuse towards me primarily and be used reverse psychology that it was not them that led me into a really depressed suicidal state but was my own.  and that i should learn how to move on, when clearly i was a wits end in trying to fix what they had either ruined or completely destroyed left and right and even do damage control because of gossip that both my parents spread just to get what they wanted.   be it project planning for software programs to social contacts with programmer friends that i knew well.   <e1> till i finally quit </e1>  because of  <e2> how badly they interfered </e2>  and be given really bad excuses.  .  .  and every time i DID try to move on, they pull off the guilt trip and shame me in front of everybody including women i try to be friends with. well at least my aunts and uncles know the reason why i am in this weird behavior and including my grandparents, was actually given an advice by them which was  until this behavior of theirs stop
I've	can.	I've been a 2-pack smoker for 35 years.  Using the patch and gum.  So many benefits to doing this, and it's starting to get easier.  Better late than never.  I used my cig $  to join a gym.  I read a book called The Power of Habit that's been really helpful.  Haven't been afraid to lean on my support people, and have the Smokefree app as well.  If I can quit, I'm pretty sure anyone can.  
Why	right	Why is everything my fault.  I hate going down this road again but I think I won't amount to anything.  I'm sorry for everything, having the wrong opinions, I'm sorry for stealing oxygen from those more deserving, I'm sorry for existing and being born.  Why anyone would consider me a friend is beyond me when in reality I'm human waste.  I hope I go to sleep and never wake up, maybe then I'll find peace and be useful and not a disappointment to my parents.  At least they got the second one right
I	appreciated!	I have a close childhood friend who has developed schizophrenia in her late teens/early 20s.  We're both 25 now.  When I visit my hometown I often catch up with her and she has come to visit me in the city overnight a handful of times. Next week I am planning on a couple days on the coast with my younger brother who she gets along with well, and I'm floating the idea of inviting her along.  She's not very independent and often finds joy in things that remind her of our childhood. I'm worried that the 6 hour car trip and 4 nights away from home might be a bit much for her, but am unsure.  I would love to spend the time with her if I knew she would enjoy it. I know that every person is different, but if anyone here has had similar experiences or wants to weigh in on my situation with advice, that would be super appreciated!
I love music and I don't know whether if I should quit smoking weed cold turkey	I would smoke almost everyday but I would like some of the stuff I make	Do you think your more creative when your high where it's a big difference?  <e1> I love music and I don't know whether if I should quit smoking weed cold turkey </e1>  because  <e2> I would smoke almost everyday but I would like some of the stuff I make </e2> . . Do people who smoke weed and make music have advantage over people who are sober? (Creatively) 
Anyone	up.	Anyone else tired of doing your best, whether it's work or school or a relationship or whatever, but it's never enough? It never gets you anywhere in life? I've always tried to be optimistic (no easy task)  and think that things have got to get better, but they never have.  I don't think I have the strength to do it anymore.  It hurts more and more each time I think I'm getting somewhere in life, only to be perpetually dragged back.  I always feel like I'm drowning and I'm starting to reach the point where I can't take it anymore and I just want to give up. 
I	better?	I only smoked for 2 years. .  Weed must really have messed with my brain chemistry.  Im not really depressed anymore, i just feel stressed out all the time and my anxiety has increased SO much.  I also have a stutter which is mild but now its almost severe.  Please tell me things will get better?
if I am weak at something, I'm afraid to do it in front of anybody else	they might judge my whole entire character by that one behaviour	I feel like that's how strangers judge other strangers.  The standard of whatever they happen to be doing at a given moment gets applied to all things they could ever possibly do.  So  <e1> if I am weak at something, I'm afraid to do it in front of anybody else </e1>  because  <e2> they might judge my whole entire character by that one behaviour </e2> .  
Honestly,	Spelling	Honestly, I think I'm 80% cured.  My therapist says I am getting better and he even reduced my dose tremendously! I haven't felt depressed in almost a week, which is honestly a great achievement for a previously massively depressed guy.  Thank you everyone for posting on this subreddit, and reassuring me that I indeed am not the only one.  From a recovering patient, I'd like to say to everyone that it does get better.  Seek professional help and just know that if you really try, your life will get better.  The way I see it, even though I have a shit ton of disadvantages, I won't let them hold me down and try to make the most of my life, as it's the only one I have.  Edit: Spelling
Like	it.	Like whilst taking the train back home, on wednesday evening, listening to some chill tracks.  I always feel so relaxed, worryfree and inspired.  Only to come home, open up my computer and slowly wither away as the night progresses.  Then it always feels like I don't deserve to feel confident and chill for a bit.  It never lasts long enough to actually do something with it. 
I've worked out	I have some more glute muscle now	So, I have a sister and she lives very far from me and is older than me.  Based off some things she's said to me, pictures she's sent, her attitude towards weight, I'm worried she might have an eating disorder or very close to risk of getting one.  The type she shows symptoms of is anorexia. I don't believe she throws up purposefully, that I know of, but she tries to maintain a body weight that is below normal weight for her and she's very strict on her diet (also, it's not much based off what I've been told) and seems to exercise a lot (which I know isn't bad, but I think it has to do with her push to be abnormally thin) Sometimes she skips a meal like lunch or breakfastShe shows an obsession with being hin.  Most people would call me skinny.  I'm naturally skinny.   <e1> I've worked out </e1>  so  <e2> I have some more glute muscle now </e2> . 
Sometimes	again.	Sometimes I get into such dark places, that I write the most heartbreaking posts about wanting to die, or crying till I feel nothing.  Then a bit later, I'm meditating and feeling connected to the universe.  Smiling as I realize that I don't have to give a fuck about such petty shit.  Life is too short bro.  I need to keep reminding the little person in my head to think happy thoughts.  Or I'll start spiraling down into my little hole of despair and my posts on this subreddit will start piling up, and then getting deleted, again and again. 
Which is extremely painful to me	I do love him	This is a sensitive subject for me, but wanted to get it out and see if anyone else can relate.  Since childhood I remember associating strong negative emotions about certain people.  So, for example, one person that I have negative emotions towards is unfortunately my brother who I really love, but nevertheless can't stand for no apparent reason, it's just like I really wish I never saw him again in my life. . .   <e1> Which is extremely painful to me </e1>  because  <e2> I do love him </e2> .  Can anyone relate, or I am just a very bad person? Of course, I would never mention these feelings to him, but still, I feel extremely guilty about it. Honestly I don't know if it's related to my OCD or not. 
I	feeling.	I did my first ninth step today with an old employer and friend.  I hadn't seen him in years and he had no idea that I even betrayed him.  I made arrangements to meet him at his home the day before which gave me plenty of time to think about what I needed to say and also to pray.  I sat down with him and told him I was a drug addict, that I was sober now and working on becoming a better person.  Then I told him that I had stolen from him, that he treated me like family and I betrayed him.  That I was selfish and regretful.  Then I returned the amount that I had taken, and told him I needed him to accept it which he did. We talked for an hour, he was very understanding and forgiving.  I left feeling a little cleaner than I did when I woke up this morning.  I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to become a better person and I want more of this feeling.   
I have had a very hard time watching new movies, or paying attention to serious tv shows or binging tv shows	I always get distracted or bored	I have had ADD since I was a kid, but when I was retested as an adult, it turned out I had gained even more traits.  The last few years  <e1> I have had a very hard time watching new movies, or paying attention to serious tv shows or binging tv shows </e1>  as  <e2> I always get distracted or bored </e2> .  About a month ago I started binge watching breaking bad, and we put captions on for an episode randomly.  It changed everything.  I can now watch almost anything, and am able to not only pay attention but also pick up more details than ever before.  I think listening and reading allowed me a way to multitask and keep myself from getting bored! Not sure if anyone else has ever done it, but it's worth a shot if you struggle with that too!
I'm thinking this will be a good catalyst for my quitting	I'll be fully occupied and around good, healthy people	I've been on this sub for years.  I've had some successful long time quits, but fell back in to daily smoking again about 6 months ago.  It's been miserable and quitting has been the worst for me this time around.  I haven't been able to gather the courage to go even one day without.  It's in my house and easily accessible in a legal state.  No excuse, but it's what's happening in my life right now.  So my plan is this.  I'm going to a yoga retreat this weekend for 3 nights and I'm not bringing weed and there won't be any.   <e1> I'm thinking this will be a good catalyst for my quitting </e1>  since  <e2> I'll be fully occupied and around good, healthy people </e2> .  I'm honestly really anxious thinking about trying to sleep around other people while I'm not high af, sleep is my major issue when quitting, and it causes me irrational anxiety.  Anyway, just looking for advice about the quitting using the yoga retreat as my own little rehab weekend.  Thanks leavers!
I	bodies	I believe there are only 5 reasons we want to reach over for that pull:A) Boredom - Weed makes me less bored. B) Fear/Anxiety - Weed will calm my nerves.  C) Anger - Weed will chill me out some.  D) Grief - Weed numbs my grieving heart.  E) Enhance good feelings.  I believe reason E to be the only good reason to ever light up.  However even E can be a slippery slope.  Just like a hungry person needs food might end up over eating and harming their bodies
I	Thanks	I have taken citalapram previously and the side effects wore off quickly except vivid dreams and acting out in my sleep.  My doctor wants me to try effexor but my research and the pharmacist are pointing me toward zoloft/setraline.   My doc says we can try Zoloft but she is worried about the sexual side effects.  From your experiences Zoloft or effexor for least sexual and sleep side effects? My research is leaning toward Zoloft just want to hear first hand experiences. Thanks
I felt like I'd made a huge improvement in my mental health	I'd been able to apply/interview for a job	Hi all, I started at a new office job today and it's the first proper job I've had in years.   <e1> I felt like I'd made a huge improvement in my mental health </e1>  just by the fact  <e2> I'd been able to apply/interview for a job </e2> .  I even went in feeling ok and not seeing it as a big deal.  The day wasn't too bad but I feel like I know nothing and I'll never fit in.  It's my first wave of depression in quite a few months and I just want to quit and go to bed for a week.  I can't tell why I'm overreacting so much, I just feel a sense of being trapped.  I have to continue otherwise I'm letting people down (including myself) but I just feel so tired and awful.  Can anyone relate? Anyone able to talk me out of being irrational?
Today	tapering	Today I got a bit strange of a headache, a weird pressure on my left side of my head.   I know deep down it's probably nothing,  but I am taking a shitload of supplements right now and was curious if anyone has had bad interactions.    I'm taking multivitamin , taurine, l tyrosine, potassium gluconate, fish oil, gaba, l theanine, 5htp, vitamin b-6, vitamin d3, SAMe 400mg, ksm 66 ashwaghanda,  calcium, and vitamin c.  While tapering
I've never been happy	I've never even had the freedom to explore my own small town	I'm starting high school.  all everyone seems to want to know from me is what I want to do after high school.  I know I want to try to get into a good college, but I really can't see myself doing anything technical or crazy important.  I just want to see the world.  thats all I've been dreaming about.   <e1> I've never been happy </e1>  because  <e2> I've never even had the freedom to explore my own small town </e2> .  I want to be the perfect, smart child, but I literally have no interests except travel.  everybody says that you can't make travelling into a career.  but if thats so then I can never be happy.  would life even be worth living if thats the case?
Ever	:/	Ever since I quit, I've lost all desire to pursue my hobbies.  Mainly the desire to play/record music, but I don't even want to do something simple like play video games.  I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that I used to smoke weed to make acivities fun.  I'd always play music high, video games high, go outside high.  In a way, I'm afraid doing these things will trigger me to smoke again.  Right now, my number one priority is to stay clean.  The clarity in my head has made my software development job way better. Luckily, the same isn't true at my job.  I've been way more proactive, communicative with the team, and overall happier.  It's after work that I can't seem to do a thing other than watch TV. Has anyone else experienced this? How long did it take to subside? I don't even have the desire to see friends, my family, even my long distance girlfriend.  :/
I've	control.	I've not had sugared candy in years and I'm having the most happiest day today.  Twizzlers, i tried coca cola regular as well.  I haven't had these in a year at least.  I've seen the sugar documentaries where everything is sugared and corn syrup'd.  I did have McDonalds as well.  So what have you all been eating? I don't believe in dieting myself.  I usually have one big meal but I've found out I'm just getting more depressed not allowing myself things.  I'm now eating whenever I can in small doses.  I believe I have the right to splurge once in a great while.  I weigh 200, and I'm not huge thanks to getting rid of risperadol.  I have a major problem with drugs just created making people who take the drugs very fat with an uncontrolled hunger.  Luckily an old generic Perphenazine curbs my urge to splurge without control.  
I'll	violently)	I'll start at the beginning. . .  When I was younger I was pretty much a social outcast, heavy set, idiot kid that had very few friends and I ended up spending most of my time playing video games.  I spent many years religiously dieting, lifting, growing friendships, and studying to sort of blossom but my past left me extremely insecure about myself.  The anxiety of trying to maintain the facade of being this perfect guy builds and turns into anger.  I get extremely jealous and I lash out (sometimes extremely violently)
why i have found that having a guided journaling experience is of great help	i wanted to share with you 10 writing promts that can help you focus and explore on your thoughts and emotions	there are a lot of resources and studies that have demonstrated the power of journaling and the benefits it can have specially for those struggling with mental issues as depression or anxiety. though journaling might seem simple and straight forward, when you stare at the blank piece of paper you might start to feel like you don't know where to start or what to focus on. that's  <e1> why i have found that having a guided journaling experience is of great help </e1>  so  <e2> i wanted to share with you 10 writing promts that can help you focus and explore on your thoughts and emotions </e2> . so - if you want to start a new journal entry today, here are 10 things you can think about:write down your biggest challenges you are facing right now. last time i faced a problem in my life, i (write down how you really did had the power to change your circumstances)recall a time or situation when you helped someone.  how did you feel?what keeps you moving when things seem tough?three of my best qualities arewrite about your achievements this week/month. one of my favorite memories is. . . what is your patience level with others on a scale of 1-10? why? how can you improve it?how can today become better?3 things you are gratefull for
im afraid to stop it	it helps me be motivated/less exhausted but god damn	fuck this drug, seriously.  half the time i feel like im on adderal, barely sleep, cant eat.   <e1> im afraid to stop it </e1>  because  <e2> it helps me be motivated/less exhausted but god damn </e2> .  i hate this medication
i've	way.	i've been experiencing anhedonia, depression, derealization, and brain fog for the past 6 months which i link to the use of both ru58841 and finasteride.  (never again. )5a-dhp is a precursor to allopregnanolone, which is a neurosteroid that tends to be low in the brains of people suffering from depression, anxiety, and mood disorders. you can purchase 5a-dhp from ideallabsdc. com/lab/5 drops taken orally of this was almost like a switch that instantly turned my brain back on.  seemingly able to focus on the things i enjoy and not feel as if i'm stuck in a constant dreary dream state of displeasure.  can actually think again, words come to me more easily, more desire to socialize, range of emotions returned. i'm not sure how much they contributed, but i had also recently begun supplementing n-acetyl-l-cysteine, acetyl-l-carnitine, and agmatine a day or two ago, but it was the 5a-dhp that really had a profound effect. can't guarantee it will solve your anhedonia, but i thought i'd post in hopes that someone will get some relief from it.  anhedonia is the worst mental state i've experienced and i couldn't imagine going the rest of my life that way. 
my	adhd.	my doctor says hes never seen someone respond so poorly to every antidepressant and that my body seems to hate serotonin. even after starting on baby doses of liquid prozac and slowly titrating up, i am absolutely crushed by the side effects (severe nausea, heart palpitations, headaches, insomnia, worsening depression, etc). ive done this now with every single ssri, snri, trazodone, otc things like 5-htp and l-tryptophan, and a tca which was the worst experience by far. given my track record, what do you think is going on biologically for me to respond this way?and would i have any luck with ketamine or microdosing psychedelics, or would this be a big no?meds that work for me are adderall and xanax for my severe anxiety and adhd. 
replace self medication with proper drugs	i'm trying to get off the caffeine	recently diagnosed with mixed depression and anxiety.  possibly also adhd.  or all focus issues could be attributable to the depression. for years i self medicated with coffee which solved my low energy and focus issues for the most part but had a high price in terms of causing / exacerbating anxiety and screwing up sleep. the problem is that my fatigue issues have actually gotten worse since starting zoloft a few weeks ago (to the point that staying awake for an entire day is hard!). my goal, in getting treatment, is to  <e1> replace self medication with proper drugs </e1>  so  <e2> i'm trying to get off the caffeine </e2> .  is there anything that specifically helps with the fatigue aspects of depression that could replace the caffeine if required? maybe concerta or  another stimulant? i'm hoping things will get better with the ssri (including fatigue and focus) but if they don't, i'll need to add something to the regimen. 
i started to have really bad sleep cycles	not being bound to mandatory attendance	is a disregulated sleep cycle / schedule a contributor to mental illness?i remember back in highschool i've had a great schedule / sleep cycle and was way less depressed than later in college.  in college  <e1> i started to have really bad sleep cycles </e1>  due to  <e2> not being bound to mandatory attendance </e2> . 
it	question)	it is well established that most antidepressants take 6-8 weeks to start working. but when a drug's steady state plasma levels are achieved in 8 days for example in the case of bupropion, what needs to happen between this 8 days and the suggested minimum treatment waiting period of 6-8 weeks?since the drug has accumulated in the body and its concentration in the bloodstream stays consistent, shouldn't a patient start experiencing the effects by the second week of taking it every day? what causes this discrepancy of 8 days and the suggested minimum trial period of 1 month?(the 8 days in this case is just an average, it can vary by 1-2 days, but that doesn't change anything relating to my question)
i've finally decided to just buy it	i hope to see some sort of improvements	got it done for vitamin d, b12 and b9, and magnesium plus another set of panels. i've also made a purchase for a tdcs device that i was looking at for the longest time.  it's been 3 years and  <e1> i've finally decided to just buy it </e1> .   <e2> i hope to see some sort of improvements </e2>  from either that or finding out my vitamin levels and supplementing for it, or both. i'm staying optimistic while keeping expectations low.  i'd be happy with any sort of improvement. update: got my blood test results two days after.  the thyroid, vitamin b12/folate, and magnesium seems fine.  my vitamin d levels have dropped from 46 ng/my (6 years ago) to 23 ng/ml.  could've been a lot worse, but still worse than before.  i'll see how things are once i try kicking it back up. 
hi,so	that?	hi,so im currently 18 and right now my depression has reached its peak. i feel very sad and tired all the time,i cant sleep,i have panic attacks from time to time,i cant eat,i dont want to socialize and do anything at all except lying in my bad. and that has been going on for awhile. i dont really know how to stop it and start acting like a normal person again,i dont remember myself not being depressed,but i can see that my depression has developed through years somehow. do any of you have the same problem?and how do you recover from that?
its	learning.	its hard to run almost every day and not have your shit together. videoi'm going to explain some physical and cognitive benefits, but first of all let me explain how a simple jog most days improved so much of my life. i was always into lifting weights and i saw as cardio as something which just opposed this.  i was wrong.  running is meditative, it's peaceful and once you break through the uncomfortable pain of starting, the pain begins to become a pleasure which is rewarding on so many levels. modern humans and our immediate ancestor homo erectus have several adaptations which make us incredible long-distance runners. with long, springy tendons in our legs and feet, like large elastics, we store and release energy with each running stride. the endurance running hypothesis tells us that humans would chase an animal for 5-10 miles until it died from heat stroke. however, take this with a grain of salt if youre going to make the claim that we evolved to run long distances. fossil records make it very clear for much of our history we would sprint, climb and crawl to scavenge.  5-10 miles per day runs an irrational risk of depleting glycogen levels and without a kill falling victim to predation through the vulnerability of fatiguea study done at the university of british columbia found that regular aerobic exercise increases the size of the hippocampus.  the hippocampus is an area of the brain responsible for verbal memory and learning. 
long	basis.	long story short. serious actual depression.  inpatient, ssri resistant.  8 month episode.  biological/endogenous. ham-d score average was 20/30.  at points, as low as 18, at worst as high as 24/30.  most days were spent crying / suicidal until 5pm when mood would lift a little bit. i decided to self administer ketamine, tired of being so depressed.  if it didn't work, i would seriously proceed with ect, then suicide.  take that or leave it. bought on darknetstested with kit from amazon -90%+ puredilluted 100mg (crystal) in warm watertookwaited 2 hours for ketamine experience to passnext day, improved mood4 days later, depression gone. ham-d score now 4/30.  complete return to normality.  unprecedented. will redose on weekly basis. 
it difficult for me to make friends	for the past 3 years i have been getting severely bullied	hi i want to keep this anonymous, every night i cry myself to sleep that makes me sound stupid ino but we all have our problems, a long with my depression i have  glot one which is a shortage of sugar to the brain and it makes me not be able to walk long distance not be able to speak or write properly this has made  <e1> it difficult for me to make friends </e1>  so  <e2> for the past 3 years i have been getting severely bullied </e2> . my depression is destroying my life i cant get out of bed i cant find the energy to go to school or even try and be happy anymorei go to councilong but even that seems like a long shot from being happy again this horrible miserable feeling is hanging over me and it wont go away no matter what i do if anyone has or has had depression or can just be someone to talk to please do comment, i feel so so alone ?thank you x
i	time.	i have depression that manifests as irritability and lack of motivation, its probably atypical.  ive tried prozac, zoloft, wellbutrin, pristiq, and cymbalta.  prozac was the only one that worked but with massive side effects.  has anyone tried other medications that helped when others didnt? im open to herbals, supplements, anything.  i just started therapy so that may help but will take time. 
after	better?	after some research.  ive seen that medication mainly helps those who have the sad depression and not those like me that are apathetic and have anhedonia. all the side effects i read are being numb.  i dont want to be more numb than i already am. so is medication out of the question? would therapy be better?
okay,	insane.	okay, so i'm on zoloft and it caused anorgasmia.  to that this, my psychiatrists put me on 300mg wellbutrin.  here's the issue.  i have a ridiculous sex drive now, but i still have anorgasmia! it's driving me nuts! do you think i should discuss going up on my wellbutrin to help with anorgasmia? i'm down from 150mg zoloft to 100mg.  i also take buspar 30mg.  anyone that has experienced this and found relief, please let me know.  i'm going insane. 
my	:=))	my psychiatrist is going to prescribe mirtzapapine to me and i am curious to read your experiences, my fellow redditers! did it help you? pros and cons? how long did you take it at what dosage? did you combine it with other drugs? (what condition(s) were you treating with it?)thank you for your input :=))
the more i am alone, the more i lose my hope or happiness and get stuck thinking bad things and suicidal etc.	now im just afraid of who i am and being alone	so much self hatred and suicidality.   <e1> the more i am alone, the more i lose my hope or happiness and get stuck thinking bad things and suicidal etc.  </e1>  so  <e2> now im just afraid of who i am and being alone </e2> .  i always spend time now with coworkers or parents and sisters.  i dont have friends, ive tried
in	lol	in my case it's most likely hormonal, but i'm feeling more sad and depressed than usual today.  i wonder if there's a supplement or something i can take that causes happiness the same way that drinking coffee can give you energy.  like a happy pick-me-up for when you feel sad.  does anyone know of something like this?other than weed, btw.  it makes me anxious and makes me ruminate too much.  not what i want at all lol
im also pushing them away accidentally	i get into such deep emotional states that im basically impaired and say or do things i dont mean to	the pills arent helping.  ive tried so many and im just at the end of my rope here.  i dont think ill ever get better and i told myself when i was younger that if i wasnt better by 21 id just end it.  but now thats come and gone and i just dont know what to do.  what other pills can i take.  i just wanna feel better and not feel of be like the fat pathetic piece of shit i am. im always depressed and always contemplate suicide.  but its escalated to brief moments of dissociative episodes, horrible ocd stuff, and just a feeling of anxiety all day.  im just scared.  ill tell my doctors all of this but i just cant do it anymore. btw im not calling the suicide hotline im not waiting on a 45 minute wait time.  and the last mental hospital i went to for a night was honestly evil and the most detrimental place for a persons mental health ever. i just feel alone and its getting so hard to pretend that im okay around my family.   <e1> im also pushing them away accidentally </e1>  because <e2>  i get into such deep emotional states that im basically impaired and say or do things i dont mean to </e2> .  wtf am i supposed to do?. 
i'm so fed up of waking up on a morning	that means another fucking day has started.	 <e1> i'm so fed up of waking up on a morning </e1>  because  <e2> that means another fucking day has started.  </e2>  i'm struggling with everything from housework to washing, even speaking with my partner and eating.  i'm worried it will cause a drift between us, but i am in so much mental torment, all i feel is pain.  i worry about everything and honestly can't see how my life is going to get any better. 
i always make things about myself	i'm such a selfish ass hole, stuck in perpetual self loathing and pity.	idk what i'm doing.  i'm trying to validate myself, i guess.  i've got it soo easy and yet i still feel like shit all of the time.  i've got nothing to worry about but yet i'm literally mid break down typing this, i'm such a peace of shit, i wonder why i have no one but i make everything worse.  so much worse.   <e1> i always make things about myself </e1> , cause  <e2> i'm such a selfish ass hole, stuck in perpetual self loathing and pity.  </e2>  i hate everything about myself i'm such a shit person
just	<3	just feeling really bad about myself and overwhelmed right now.  i'm home alone, there's no one to talk to, and i don't feel up to doing much, especially if it involves going outside.  does anyone have suggestions? i've been trying not to let bad feelings ruin my day today but it's not looking too good right now.  thanks in advance! <3
for	advice?	for me i think i overthink every single part of the day.  every little thing anyone says i overthink it and i dont know how to stop.  its really affecting my mental health and i have no clue what to do to stop it.  the worse part it every thing i overthink i always think of the negative outcomes of every situation.  ive been writing my feelings, worries, and thoughts down since the beginning of may and it seems to work only a little bit.  any advice?
job	head?	job hop, the first few months of a job make me thrilled to be there, and then i slowly start to feel like its mundane and makes me sad,i also jump when i hear random knocks and bumps and car doors outside,i dont feel like i can relax and i havent had a genuine laugh since. . . . . . i cant remembercan anyone give me advice on how to live outside me own head?
it was this year when i didn't want to go to face to face	last year i would want to break down for no reason in front of everyone at school	 <e1> it was this year when i didn't want to go to face to face </e1>  because  <e2> last year i would want to break down for no reason in front of everyone at school </e2>  and i never this to my mom and i didn't want that this year. so what my mom did was make an appointment with a therapist. i started waking up in the morning earlier and changing ways i eat and before coming to class , i would take go to the restroom and take deep breaths. the urges to cry isn't that bad anymore but i still need to work on some things. like thinking bad things are going to happen or having thoughts of bad things happening. 
i	pass.	i don't want to die, i don't hate my life.  i'm just scared. i've seen the way i handle pretty much everything in my life, and it seems that no matter how hard i try i can never quite get the handle of things for any substantial period of time.  sort of like a dream, where everything is in my mind, but i have little to no actual control. sometimes i get so anxious about the future that i just feel like i should just quit prematurely while things are sort of ok, before i screw up my life any further.  and yes, i know that life is full of good moments too, but i always feel like i don't really deserve them.  i don't want to die, i just want to stop living, if that makes any sense.  like i wish i could become a mountain or a river spirit or something, that way i can exist and i can just watch other people enjoy their lives and let time pass. 
i'm insecure	i've never been on medication before.	my doctor has prescipted those to me, but  <e1> i'm insecure </e1>  cause  <e2> i've never been on medication before.  </e2> nothing too scary please, i'm very vulnerable right now. be honest but not too vulgar. 
im	stressed	im a lonely person with depression and anxiety, i keep panicking for no reason and i have a heart issue (heart beat acceleration) i genuinely dont know what can i do to calm down , i get chest pain when im feeling like this and sometimes i get distracted and it works for a bit , but what do i do when i have 0 people around me, does anyone know how can i help myself im very stressed
theres	time.	theres days where i dont want to get out of bed.  i want to lay there and cry, sleep, and cry some more.  i make myself go to work.  i wake up sometimes, thinking, whats the point?.  today was different.  i woke up with hope.  i also had my first therapy appointment today. i feel excited for the future for the first time in a long time. 
traveling with my husband and mil (who are probably my best traveling companions	they make me feel safe and brave) for family stuff	i don't think i have posted here often or at all, but i thought writing this out here might help me not feel so crazy.  <e1> traveling with my husband and mil (who are probably my best traveling companions </e1>  because  <e2> they make me feel safe and brave) for family stuff </e2> .  it's been awhile since i last traveled let alone left the apartment since the beginning of the pandemic and lockdown over a year ago. since the beginning, my 2 cats have been really helpful with my anxiety and depression.  i even made up a saying with them: 'if they're not afraid.  then, neither am i', which somehow works for me.  it's probably pretty weird. the oldest cat seems to always know when i need some cuddles and purrs.  the youngest  just seems to know how to make me smile with her antics.  even more so since the pandemic. it's the 2nd night and i can't help but immensely miss them.  i talked about it with my husband, which helped me a lot.  still, i just wanted to write down my feelings to see if anyone understands this. 
were	subside?	were you incredibly angry when you came off of it? like just all the time? and if so, how long did it take to subside?
we	fragile.	we both have depression and anxiety, but i think he is furthur in his treatment than i am.  for the past year i've been saying things that had made him angry, frustrated or just feel shitty or insignificant.  i never wanted to make him feel like this, but it's like i don't recognize the boundries anymore.  to me we are still joking around, to him it's invalidation and disrespect.  i can't seem to do anything well lately.  i think i'm hurting him and he deserves better than sb who disrespects him and his trauma constantly.  i always apologize and try make it up to him, but i think he might be done with my shit.  i don't know folx, everything seems so fragile. 
i just realized it less	i was always at school or gym and forced myself to not realize	are ppl really happy?  is there a way to be happy?  what did they do? studied well eventhoght their parent pressured? never got sad cause no one was on their side. . . ?or even tried to be.  i don't know how some people manage to ignore haters.  i swear i tried i just care so much.  well i have zero motivation or i get some for like, 15 minutes and then i don't see it as motivating.  i think i've had depression from before covid.   <e1> i just realized it less </e1>  because  <e2> i was always at school or gym and forced myself to not realize </e2> .  well quarantine tore me down. 
i	to	i wish i could show you the pain. if it was physical. it would be so clearly manifested. a broken arm that bleeds at the gash created. a face twisted in agony with imaginary tears,the pain too great and clean,writhing at the mercy of hurt. but this isn't physical. and i can't tear myself open in half for you to
i didn't	i have been scared	i just started taking abilify with my 20 mg lexapro.  i suffer from ocd, anxiety and depression.  i have been afraid to try it but my psychiatrist has tried so many other medicines which haven't helped and he really thinks this one will work well with my lexapro.   he has been trying to get me to take it for months and  <e1> i didn't </e1>  because  <e2> i have been scared </e2> .   i just took my first 5 mg dose and am really looking for other's that can let me know their success stories.   thank you and take care ?
i	better!	i recently got anxiety like last month and i have been on lexapro for about 2 weeks.  i feel much better, but i keep having shortness and breath issues.  is it normal to feel out of breath everyday? i want that symptom to leave.  can someone help me with some techniques to calm my shortness of breath.  i want to start feeling better!
moving	<3	moving forward.  moving fast.  how does this happen? by being still, release, keep going. todays world has conditioned us to feel envious, jealous of other peoples success, exposure and what they have received, after putting 1000's of hours into it.  why is that?insecurity, lack of gratitude, lack of patience, lack of self awareness & lack of faith. when we create, when we follow, when we believe deep down & i mean deep down, that our path is solely for us and no one else's, thats when life really gets happy, when life really gets bright. here is the thing; if you know that everyones time comes that puts in an overwhelming amount of work, then whats the worry? would we judge? of course not.  would we compare ourselves? of course not. keep clapping.  keep working hard.  your time is coming, as is mine, as is every single person that puts in relentless work. release expectation and just be. today: listen to this weeks podcast, number 29 on accountability.  on all streaming platforms. i love you. drey <3
anxiety is always the same	tired of waiting for no improvement	since two years now im anxious af 24/7 that don't make me able to get out of my house for other thing than supermarket . . . . my day is about lying on the floor and try manage my breathingi've tried cymbalta for 2 months in 2019, in 2020 i've decided to see psychiatrist again and he prescribed me lexapro over 3 month at maximum dosage and i'm now on 10mg of lexapro coupled with 75mg of effexor (it take this one since 1 week now)i've also never have any withdrawl or noticeable side effect on medication (good point but i'm ready too manage if something can finally work for my anxiety) <e1> anxiety is always the same </e1>  (gad and social anxiety don't go away)so  <e2> tired of waiting for no improvement </e2> 
i had one	the boss booked a meeting in a few days	does anyone else feel exhausted after a spike of anxiety? <e1> i had one </e1>  because  <e2> the boss booked a meeting in a few days </e2>  to go over the job and any additions to my workload (not phrased in that way) and all i could think of was i'm in trouble and about to be firedfinally calmed down and now just want to take a nap. 
i	started	i just have no motivation to do literally anything or talk to anyone.  at the same time im lonely and want someone to talk to but as soon as someone reaches out i lose the desire to talk. . .  im so overwhelmed and stress from school im starting to shut down but im terrified of getting bad grades.  i was talking to my therapist and trying to describe how i feel and i described it as if a brain is a whole egg mine is currently and scrambled egg.  its either i feel all emotions at once or absolutely nothing.  i thought my anxiety and depression were getting better and now i feel like im back where i started
after	sorry.	after four years of not working i have my first job interview tomorrow.  i am scared.  i'm not even sure if i want this job, but the money would be good.  it would be perfect if it it was part time but it's not.  a friend of mine told me to be honest and tell them about my issues with depression (which is partially why i haven't worked in a long time).  maybe he's right.  the anxiety is killing me though, i don't know if i'm able to work 8h a day, i'm afraid it will soon end with a nervous breakdown.  which is probably what i need for doctors to take my issues seriously.  anyway, i just needed to share this rambling, sorry. 
heart	<3	heart pounding.  scared.  anxious? protecting ourself.  the ups, the downs.  they matter. it starts slow, it starts with constant work and then everything happens.  with hard work, with dedication, the light is already ours, why? faith.  keep going.  keep pushing. blue sky out, blue sky inside, refreshing.  today, try something new.  try something that you have been wanting to. with each day it gives us a new opportunity; whats the point of focusing on what we don't have? its apart of being a human. we learn through the process, we learn through the waves, we learn through the highs, the lows and everything in between.  keep pushing and whats meant is already ours, on the way. i am proud of you. i love you. drey <3
it	<3	it starts from inside.  that is where the good, bad or the ugly will come.  it isn't what is perceived, it isn't what is seen but only, what is felt. the ups and downs, they can all be ups, perspective.  through the tough times lately i have been embracing how i am feeling, exhaustion, not good enough, the waves, treacherous waters or still rivers, it all matters. something that i am proud of is the connections that i have made with my inner being but then being able to express it to others.  the beautiful conversations, interactions, experiences, even if sometimes they don't go the way i expect, they still go. expectations.  the root of most of our anxieties, pains of a human being.  subconscious conditioning of what we have felt, lived through prior and now what we are bringing to the present moment. release, let go. i love you. drey <3
i	.	i feel very lost at the moment.  ive tried reading online about ways to overcome but havent found anything really or anything too helpful.  my biggest issue which really irritates me is how awkward i am and this has really f**ked me up.  my biggest problem is that im better in groups but when 1 on 1 am useless.  i cant have 1 to 1 conversations with people, cant even message people privately.  its really messing with my ability to have more meaningful friendships and even relations (gf).  ive no idea what to do and this is really killing me inside.  the problem isnt that i dont talk enough or i see others as more (neither are the case), its that i genuinely have no idea what to say (please dont say act yourself - i do).  would really appreciate any advice or useful things to do to overcome. . . . 
ive	me.	ive recently discovered live bird cams, theyre 24/7 streams of bird feeders in areas with high wildlife activity.  when im starting to feel a wave of anxiety i put on one of these and it helps bring me down, especially post panic attack.  its so relaxing and makes me momentarily happy to just watch the songbirds pecking away at seeds and the squirrels eating peanuts.  my favorite has to the be cornell feederwatch ( allaboutbirds. org/cams/cornell-lab-feederwatch/) also, many zoos now have live feeds of their animals.  hope this works for you like it did for me. 
i believe that once we start following our heart	thats when the universe will choose us to move forward	we say one thing and then don't believe in it.  less talking, more doing.  here we are.  in the 21st century, living our life as we please, as we choose to. remember that we have all the capabilities to live the life we want to, by doing what we want to, the only thing is, is that we have to have a deep level of patience, persistence, dedication, consistency and work ethic.  remember though, we will have to work hard either way to make it through this life, it will be for someone else or it will be for ourself, with us working for someone else for a brief time, which do you choose?i chose working for someone for a brief moment, while working fucking hard with what i love to do.  here, i am.  its possible.  everyone can do it. i believe that every single human being is multifaceted, that every human being can do multiple things, i don't believe that certain people are chosen,  <e1> i believe that once we start following our heart </e1> ,  <e2> thats when the universe will choose us to move forward </e2> .  we are all already chosen.  follow your heart. i love you. drey <3
its	feel.	its my 27 birthday.  in all honesty its nothing to celebrate.  another year of anxiety, another year of losing family, another year closer to death.  im shaking, my whole body is trembling.  i know i need to act a certain way and it sucks.  surrounded by people who love me but i feel like i cant tell them how i feel. 
change	<3	change is inevitable.  change will happen either way, if we want it or not.  we as the human must be open to the change.  the change is where we will find our true self, lose a part of our self that is no longer needed, what is needed though is the will to keep going. over the past year of my life, and all of our lives, change was forced onto us, we didn't choose to be where we are now, nor did we even know that it was going to happen, we changed.  change happens if we want it or not. i am proud of us.  some days may be difficult, but what am i learning is that the struggle comes from the eye of the beholder not from the actual situation itself.  watching rather than judging.  taking a step back when needed, instead of rushing in.  rushing in when we feel like we need to. life changes & when it does, that is the universe showing us that we are ready for that change, the sole thing we have to do, is embrace it.  do so, life will get good after. i love you. drey <3
anyone	today	anyone ever feel like they are not good enough for their kids. ? just lost my job and now can't do easter just feel so down today
i'll have more on my list tomorrow	i can't just sit here watch a video	this is probably generic af.  but after every day, every job interview, every picture taken of me - i don't like it.  i don't think i did anything good at all.  the only thing that helps, i believe, is to just keep myself busy.  move onto something else, a task, cleaning, dancing.  or journaling.  sometimes i keep on going, suppressing the rumination and wake up at 4 am with major anxiety.  i feel a bit like i'm burning myself out.  especially when i'm sleep-deprived - take a nap or push through? take a day off? but then  <e1> i'll have more on my list tomorrow </e1> .  <e2> i can't just sit here watch a video </e2> .  i feel like i need to work work work.  others work harder.  but you can't pour from an empty cup.  or can you? is it better to deliver fast or to take time and deliver quality but risk being too late?
i hate my life	im tired of feeling humiliated and thinking everyones talking about me	 <e1> i hate my life </e1>   <e2> im tired of feeling humiliated and thinking everyones talking about me </e2>  and i wish assisted suicide were real and i could kms with my childhood tv show characters so i wouldnt die aloneill delete this later
we have a very loving community	i'd love to see you there	so i started streaming recently with the goal being to create a place for anyone who is depressed, anxious or struggling with anything to hang out and have someone/a community to talk to.  please come join if you ever feel lonely or need to hear someones voice!  <e1> we have a very loving community </e1>  so  <e2> i'd love to see you there </e2> :)
in	<3	in this moment, whats right for you? thats only something that you can tell. we live in a world where we can choose, light or darkness.  light takes more time to work on with ourselves, where darkness can be more fast to connect with. when you know whats right for you, then follow it; no matter what the noise around you is trying to tell you different.  its what is in your heart. if someone hasn't told you this lately i am proud of you, so keep going.  with the constant shifts of life, we have been shown that we can make it through everything that is thrown at us, together, separately. if you feel something different from the energy that you put out, then remove yourself from that situation, from those people and know that its ok provide space for yourself.  when we allow the universe to close the doors that are desperately trying to be closed, thats when abundance, people and experiences will be brought to you. i love you. drey <3
im just happy im not falling into anxiety	attacks or a depressive episode	i didnt really cry today and felt less broken hearted today.  it got easier, and its still hurts a lot and it will take time, but im finally moving on and thats wonderful.   <e1> im just happy im not falling into anxiety </e1>   <e2> attacks or a depressive episode </e2> 
i'm	again.	i'm having a really hard time right now, i've just started to develop a lot of depressive symptoms (sleeping a lot, apathy, irritability, etc).  i've always been incredibly anxious and i've mostly managed it but these new symptoms are the complete opposites of how i normally feel and i just don't know how to handle it. i'm medicated for my anxiety and am regularly seeing my psychologist but it's slow.  i've been really inattentive lately and it's something that really bothers me.  it was a really big important day for my partner today and i literally did not have any recollection of even being told about it.  and not only that, but they hinted at it multiple times today and i didn't even notice. i just want to be myself again. 
well,	alive.	well, this is one of the times i have felt the most depressed in my life.  theres so much tension in my life i cant escape from or solve right now and its eating me alive. 
so,	take?	so, i have always been too proud to take any meds (prescribed to me) or walk in and ask for meds but. . . .  at this point i think i need something.  i hate looking at myself and seeing the same piece of crap every day.  nothing changes and nothing absolutely nothing makes me happy.  i get anxiety for no reasons or maybe their is a reason and i'm not looking close enough.  point being is that i am fucking tired so tired of being me.  i would love to just leave my body and never come back but. . . . .  like isn't like black mirror.  what do you guys take?
i	stressful.	i made an appointment with a new primary care doctor.  my old one told me that she does not usually allow depression/anxiety patients to take short term disability.  i got my therapist to sign all the forms instead luckily, but ever since that convo with my old pcp i have hated the thought of going back to her.  im on short term disability now and probably will need to extend it. making progress! i just hope the new doctor is more open minded about my care.  all of this is so stressful. 
we	<3	we all have many things that we love, in our own way.  we have passions we want to focus on, things we want to try, goals we want to accomplish, but then we get scared & sometimes shy away? why is that? divine timing & insecurity. we are all insecure with something.  it is all valid.  when we make peace with these insecurities by even acknowledging them and allowing ourselves to feel it, thats when we can begin to untangle the tension, stress, anxiety, depression etc. , that we have fed into for such a long time, or has been projected onto us.  we learn, we grow and together we thrive. through the past several years i have really begun to connect with the universe and with the divine that we are all connected by.  now what you believe in is up to you to decide, god, source, the universe, divine etc. , we are all connected. allow yourself to be present with the emotions of life.  the ups, the downs and everything in between, we learn, grow and heal through the wave learning growth theory. i love you. drey <3
every	know.	every day is a pain my heart beats so fast, it's almost as loud as my thoughts.   i feel like i'm not doing enough for my group for our thesis paper, but i'm too afraid to talk to them.  i don't know what i'm doing. . .  help me i don't know who to go to.  i'm taking meds and seeing a therapist but i don't know. 
i	general.	i always feel like im on the verge of tears and so vulnerable and sensitive and very often do break down into tears.  im scared of everything.  scared of going back to work.  scared if i find a job thats better for me i wont like it.  scared of making choices.  just scared in general. 
on	went.	on a saturday afternoon of all times, wow.  never thought i would but my sister needed help buying groceries and just said yes without thinking.  i exhausted but glad i went. 
was looking at it just now	some anxiety just hit and i'm panting like a dog	keep this on my phone,  <e1> was looking at it just now </e1>  because  <e2> some anxiety just hit and i'm panting like a dog </e2> .  thought it might be useful for others. that thought isn't helpful right now. now is not the time to think about it; i can think about it later. this is irrational - i'm going to let it go. this is not an emergency.  i can slow down and think clearly about what i need. this feels threatening and urgent, but it isn't. i don't have to be perfect to be okay. i don't have to figure out this question; i can just drop it. it's okay to make mistakes. i already know from past experience that this is irrational. i have to take risks in order to be free - i'm willing to take this risk. it's okay that i just thought or felt that.  it doesn't mean anything, and i don't have to pay attention to it. i'm ready to move on now. i can handle being wrong. i don't have to suffer.  i deserve to be comfortable. this isn't my responsibility. this isn't my problem. i've done the best i can. 
me and you are gonna make it through one day at a time	thats all we can do	from one stranger to another, i love you and im proud of you.  youre pushing through and youre doing the best that you can do every day.  you are beautiful, you are worthy, you are amazing.   <e1> me and you are gonna make it through one day at a time </e1>  because  <e2> thats all we can do </e2> . the world is so oddly shitty and beautiful at the same time.  some things and some people have so much to offer you.  stick around and see what this is all about.  well be okay, my friend. 
i just want to feel even worse	its so comfortable	im constantly waiting for someone closer to me to give up or get annoyed with my situation and to leave me.  once someone does that, ill finally feel like every negative idea i have of myself is true.  im just waiting for something to push me off the edge.   <e1> i just want to feel even worse </e1> , because  <e2> its so comfortable </e2> .  i know this is dark but im so tired. 
this	this?	this has happened to me a few times; ill be in a really bad place and start typing how i feel to post it, but stop myself and delete the draft at some point.  i usually feel self-conscious and anxious, but i dont know about what.  anyone else ever done this?
i	chore.	i just feel like i don't have anything left in me anymore.  no motivation and everything is a chore.  i also feel like a limp, listless rag doll.  lots of lethargy and fatigue.  i just don't want to do anything anymore. i mean, how difficult is it to get a simple shave, make a cup of coffee or send someone a text message?.  and yet, i have to really psych myself up, get myself in the mood and force myself to do even the smallest of things and even then, it feels like a huge chore. 
and	come.	and because of that, you just get so depressed and wondering what is the point of all the struggle? why does life have to be so bad sometimes? im just scared of whats to come. 
sometimes	?	sometimes when i want to sleep i am so restless and extremly angry without a real reason.  and then i get so fucking angry at my boyfriend for no reason, even everything he wants to do is help me.  it's like the anger consumes me and i can't stop it.  have you ever experienced anger like this ?
past	again.	past 5 years have been a mess.  i've literally messed up everything.  lost the almost-won battles.  overall, i've been a failure in all aspects of my life.  the status quo is that i've completely isolated myself.  i've zero friends.  i've zero self confidence.  i've zero strength to make efforts and try anything new.  i've a few options which are basically of do or die level and i'm too scared i'm definitely gonna die and will be back to square one. i've been under the assumption that may be i'm just lazy to actually put an effort into something.  but the truth is that deep down i'm just scared as fuck.  i'm scared of letting everyone down again. 
i've	ok.	i've been dealing with the same shit in my head since i was 14(i'm now 26) and i just want peace.  i'm tired of fighting with myself.  there's a war going on in my brain and all i want is quiet.  i don't feel like it'll ever stop.  i wish my constant suicidal thoughts would stop.  i wish my anxiety would stop holding me back from doing the things that i want to do.  i just want to be ok. 
i find myself sitting up all night	being afraid of the next day	 <e1> i find myself sitting up all night </e1>  due to  <e2> being afraid of the next day </e2> , having so much to worry about constantly on my mind that sleeping just feelings like its just going to bring all that closer.  there's something soothing about the 3 am time span where i can be completely alone without feeling guilty for doing it.  going to sleep feels like i'm bringing the pain closer, all my worries closer, and that these things can't hurt me if i just don't sleep! maybe that's the procrastinator mindset, pushing all my problems away and delaying as much as possible.  or maybe that's just depression working it's magic on me. . . 
this	??	this has been a very stressful and anxious day for me already and i just wanted to send love and support to others! we got this.  ??
i	solutions?	i seem to get most depressed when the sunset starts and then it just spirals from there.  does anybody else have this and if they do, do they know any solutions?
i	right?	i guess it's to trick my brain into thinking that the anxiety isn't a part of me.  this is probably a bad thing, considering, well, i'm always anxious most of the time.  i don't want to make it seem like the anxiety is mine, and that it's just not there.  but, i may as well be denying it altogether, right?
does	you!	does anyone else experience this? how do you overcome it?edit: i made it inside yall! though i sill felt anxious about tasks when i sat down it got better and i saw your responses.  thank you!
has	?	has anyone experienced this? i (45f) have been married for 23 years.  i have gad, ocd and bouts of depression.  my husband (46) has never been sympathetic or patient.  ive basically had to teach him how to understand and help me.  hes an arrogant person, and doesnt like to be questioned.  weve been together since we were 16 and have two kids (18f, 21f).  im pretty new to the concept of gaslighting - eldest is studying psychology and said her dad is doing this to me.  its all beginning to make sense and i just dont know what to do.  i am feeling so stupid and humiliated.  i dont know what to do ?
i	tired.	i called the suicide hotline today.  they didn't really help me at all.  i just told them what they wanted to hear so i could get off the line with them.  i took extra medications to help with my suicidal thoughts and panic attack, now i'm a vegetable.  life, marriage and my mind is getting to hard to deal with.  my husband dosent appreciate me for all the hard work i do, i work all the time, and i'm tired and don't sleep.  there are so many voices of me in my head, i've even recently started seeing shadow figures around my home out of the corners of my eyes.  i wanted to end it all today, but i suppose that's the wrong thing to do.  i'm just so tired. 
it frustrates me	i feel like some people are ok with you struggling as long as you dont help self harm or are suicidal	ive been dealing with depression and anxiety for about 7 years.  for a majority of that time i was never suicidal and never had suicidal idealization, i wanted to live, to get through itnow i basically have suicidal thoughts everyday.  but one thing about dealing with mental illness is that people treat it like its not an illness.  and if a mentally ill person is suicidal or dies by suicide then people are concerned.   <e1> it frustrates me </e1>  because  <e2> i feel like some people are ok with you struggling as long as you dont help self harm or are suicidal </e2> , they never mention the quality of your life.  when they say how do we prevent suicide i think about changing that persons life and addressing their concerns rather than just making sure theres nothing that can harm them.  or taking someone with mental illness seriously without them having to harm themselves or die. just ranting ?
i	it?	i miss intimacy tbh hugs especially, were into lockdown again and im low-key craving some intimacy and i dont know how you cope without it.  its sad isnt it?
bit of a sneaky trick on my monkey brain	i will have to stay longer while it gets cooked and i eat it	i was invited last week and i was so close to going.  at the last minute my anxiety and ptsd got the better of me and i drove home instead.  felt pretty stink over the weekend.  got down and beat myself up.  took a bit to pull myself back out of that. today i want to be different.  today i want to go, despite feeling anxious. ive decided to buy myself bacon and eggs at the cafe if i make it.  ( <e1> bit of a sneaky trick on my monkey brain </e1>  as  <e2> i will have to stay longer while it gets cooked and i eat it </e2> . ) i do love bacon and eggs!
i	negativity	i am sorry if this is not what you wanted.  i am sorry if i can't cheer you up.   i am sorry if this is not what you expected things to be and i am really sorry for just being a disappointment and being the way i am but this is how things are and how i am and i really understand if someone drifts apart because of this i have lost a lot of people because of this and do have the courage to lose more.  i am sorry if i am just like this.  and i told you before too that most of the people don't like to be around people who are struggling with their lives or are going through a tough time in any way it can be frustrating and difficult to keep up with them and if at any point, you feel like pls i know you are a human and everyone has limits.  so, u can walk away.  your mental health >>>>>>>> anything any person i'd rather see you happy with someone else than be stuck with my negativity
eventually, you just give up and stop trying	nothing good ever happens in your life	1 step forward. . . 2 steps back.  sometimes it feels like being on a sinking ship out in the middle of the vast ocean during a violent storm. it's kind of like that in real-life.  you have all of these hopes, dreams and goals and yet they only get crushed on a regular basis as life keeps taking (but never giving).  as life keeps piling on you and you get that sinking feeling that everything is stacked against you and no matter what you do, it will fail.   <e1> eventually, you just give up and stop trying </e1>  because  <e2> nothing good ever happens in your life </e2> .  never a light at the end of the tunnel.  not so much as even the slightest ray of hope.  just all of the good things you hoped for in life are replaced by only bad things. . . leaving you feeling gloomy, hopeless and depressed. anyone feel like this?.  like it's never going to get better?. 
being anxious at work all day	i come home and crash	hey people.  i sleep so so much.  sometimes i sleep for 14 hours.  i honestly love it.  nothing better then to relax and forget.  whenever things that stress me out happen my mind whispers  go to sleep and i do.  and  <e1> being anxious at work all day </e1>   <e2> i come home and crash </e2> .  but i believe my anxiety and depression has gotten better.  and i want to live.  i'm also obese no shit hahah.  and would love to get healthier.  so how oh how do you stay awake. 
been	that.	been dealing with a lot of things lately with work, life and relationships.  i easily get angry and overwhelmed with all the real problems plus thoughts and worry that don't make any sense.  i sometimes just burst and scream at the top of my lungs.  i don't talk to anyone about anything and don't have an outlet to cope with everything in my head.  anyone feel the same way at times?i've been told that i have anger management issues but i think it stems from all the crap in my head.  its depressing for people to think that. 
does	?	does anybody else constantly feel tired and just foggy even when they arent consciously feeling anxious or in a depressed mood ?
how long will i be running away from people	i can't face them like this	i fail consistently at whatever i try to do, plan to do, would like to want to do.   that job, that college. .  it has never happened the way i've wanted to.  i know it doesn't have to. but i feel ashamed that i have no ambitions in life.  the urge to achieve something- nothing of that sort.  this has been happening for years now and it gets me all the more crushing my confidence and spirit or whatever little will power that i have. i further go on to avoid people feeling guilty i'm like this and also shameful.  they look at my failures with pity letting me know how pathetic all of this is.  i don't know how long my life will go on like this.   <e1> how long will i be running away from people </e1>  because  <e2> i can't face them like this </e2> . it's just a sad reality that gets difficult to deal with. 
and	depressed!?	and i just said no i don't know why i just felt like i wasn't in the mood if that even makes fkng sense and she was little aggressive about it like are you depressed!?
so	voice.	so i started streaming recently with the goal being to create a place for anyone who is depressed, anxious or struggling with anything to hang out and have someone to talk to.  please come join if you ever feel lonely or need to hear someones voice. 
im this anxious	i startle so easily	i start grad school tomorrow and im an anxious wreck.  when  <e1> im this anxious </e1> ,  <e2> i startle so easily </e2> .  my boyfriend was sitting near the bathroom and seeing him when i walked out startled the shit out of me.  my body is on constant high alert and i hate it so much.  i hate taking my benzos. . .  but today might be a xanax and chill day ?
after	doctor.	after over 6 months of insomnia, i finally went to the doctor.  i've always been at least slightly depressed and my anxiety has increased the past yeat and a half. as the nurse asked me questions about depression, i thought, jfc, i am more depressed than i thought.  not suicidal, but it wouldn't necessarily take much to get close to it. anyway, he put me on trazadone and celexa.  we'll see how the celexa works, but last night i slept the entire night - first time in many, many months. not looking for advice, just wanted to encourage any going through s similar to the not put off going to the doctor. 
i	afterwards.	i find it really emotionally overwhelming for some reason to go out of town for a couple days.  i absolutely love traveling and seeing friends/family.  but even if the weekend is fantastic, i find myself crying on the way home and just generally overwhelmed with nostalgia and depression for days afterwards. 
does	heightens?	does anyone else get excessively cold and start to shiver uncontrollably if their anxiety really heightens?
at night i'm just suicida	i dont know how to deal	well tbh i havent acomplished anything in life,but  that's besides the point.  in quarantine, i've been hearing about people creating art, taking  online classes,changing their life, etc.  and i havent been doing shit.  other than my daily workout and walking my dog, i've literally been sitting on my ass for months playing videogames.  i'm just too depressed to do anything else. everytime i try to focus on the real world i end up having a fucking mental breakdown.  as a severe germaphobe and hypochondriac, a pandemic is my worst nightmare.  everyday i wake up in my worst nightmare.  i dont know how to cope,  <e1> at night i'm just suicida </e1> l, because  <e2> i dont know how to deal </e2> . my already sickly grandmother got the virus and hasn't been doing to great.  my uncles are conspiracy theorists and my dad is a respiratory therapist trying to help c*vid patients.  oh well, i guess because the u. s.  is run by idiots, i guess i have a while longer to accomplish something during quarantine (if i dont die first). 
tired of being told to exercise	it will help	i'm so tired of this.  tired of going to bed hoping i do wake up.  tired of people leaving my life.  tired of trying to convince myself i want to keep going.  tired of taking pills with miserable side effects to try and help.   <e1> tired of being told to exercise </e1>  because  <e2> it will help </e2> .  tired of depression, anxiety, female hair loss, diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome.  i'm so fucking tired. 
vaping	anxious	in the commercial the girl says  <e1> vaping </e1>  made her  <e2> anxious </e2>  where she wasnt before.  that was scary for her so it should be scary for me, right? except, me having been anxious my whole life, when i found recreational drugs like cigarettes & vodka, the anxiety went away.  i found that it helped with my insomnia.  it helped with my social awkwardness.  it helped quiet the voices in my head.  of course that only lasted so long.  sleepytime tea only works every so often too.  so, its a one sided message that is trying to be all encompassing.  i kinda wish it would address the reason she picked it up in the first place.  but then, it would be an after school special, not a commercial or psa or whatever. 
wake	.	wake up with anxiety.  palpitations.  feel like something bad is about to happen.  smoke.  shower.  get dressed.  office.  work my ass off.  thankful for the distraction.  no appetite.  smoke instead.  get of work.  exhausted.  suicidal thoughts.  sleep or at least try. wake up with anxiety.  palpitations. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
most people in my life misjudged me for who i am	it has become my instinct to say unwelcoming words to protect myself from getting hurt from others	 <e1> most people in my life misjudged me for who i am </e1> .   <e2> it has become my instinct to say unwelcoming words to protect myself from getting hurt from others </e2> .  i cannot bring myself to open to anyone.  now life has been really tough, and i just want to fade away. 
i'm feeling a lot of guilt	my last manic depressive episode	woke up this morning more depressed than i've been in a long, long time.  trying to focus on the positives and find things to be grateful for. . .  which i know exist, but i'm totally blind to when i'm in this state. my therapist forgot to schedule our session and  <e1> i'm feeling a lot of guilt </e1>  over  <e2> my last manic depressive episode </e2> .  i nearly destroyed my marriage, i did destroy a really close friendship i had built and deeply hurt my friend by doing so, and i burned bridges with my extended family.  top that with other on-going health issues. . .  it's a lot.  and most days i feel i can carry the burden, but today it's just too much. sorry for venting.  thanks for reading.  just getting this off my chest has helped a little. 
people are so vulnerable at night	they are willing to spill out their souls to anyone willing to listen	 <e1> people are so vulnerable at night </e1> .   <e2> they are willing to spill out their souls to anyone willing to listen </e2> .  they have desires to do things that never cross their mind when the sun is in the sky. 
i moved there	i could not get a job	hi.  this is my first post on reddit.  i'm 31 years old, and past 10 years i have been living in my mom's basement.   <e1> i moved there </e1>  because  <e2> i could not get a job </e2> .  and now i can not get out.  it's awful here, it's a little village, me against the village.  people stare at me from behind the curtains, not kidding.  i spend most my days in bed, 10 years in dialogue with the suicidal thoughts.  anyone here in a similar living situation? it's so hard, it's so profoundly painful. 
realizing that it doesn't get better is the first step	i don't need the cheer up responses	probably should be on a suicide subreddit but i have tried so hard in life to be a loving, caring person to be around but all i have found is heartache, heartbreak, hate, and lies.   <e1> realizing that it doesn't get better is the first step </e1>  so  <e2> i don't need the cheer up responses </e2> .  i know that there are plenty of people that understand without sympathizing with me.  this world steals and takes blindly and doesn't care what will happen the next day.  time is bought and people are hurt.  the saddest part is i have felt this way since my younger teen years, and though i would not consider myself old, i have had ample time in my life to seek love, kindness and all the qualities deemed as good.  the wiser i become, the worse i feel and at this point, being depressed has become a part of life that i have accepted. 
i cant see myself ever having a future	im not sure if ill make it	why is it that even though i have good things in my life and good people, i always come back to the thought of not having a future,  <e1> i cant see myself ever having a future </e1>  because  <e2> im not sure if ill make it </e2> .  i smile and find joy in life but it all gets overwritten by the bad things that have and have yet to happen in my life.  sometimes i just want to go ahead and end it all but then i think of what that would to other people in my life.  im torn between a world where i have people around me who love me and a world where i dont know how i still even exist.  ive come very close two times now.  someone please help me.  im too tired to be ashamed anymore.  i just need help.  please. 
i	you.	i work for my families business.  my position (which is fairly new - i started this position in jan 2020) directly affects the production of the business.  when i dont do well, my family cant pay bills and we all get stressed.  ive never had this much weight on my shoulders and i dont know how to cope.  when i was younger, i coped with self harm.  when i was a fresh adult, i coped with substance abuse.  i cant use either of those methods now as i have to stay functioning and cant have a breakdown.  what do i do? when i get home i am so tired and depressed i just sit there.  i am starting school back again in the fall and i dont know how i will be able to realistically work full time and leave for school two days of the week.  plus have time for homework.  i am really worried about all this and need some help finding ways to cope with this stress.  thank you. 
okay	face.	okay so these days i don't get sad phase ,i get phase where i'm happy for like 2 mins.  and then again sadness and numbness.  i'm stuck in loophole of depressive thoughts.  everytime i wanna start something i see all the time i've wasted.  i just don't know anymore.  no motive.  no results.  overthinking is getting the best of me.  i had not laughed genuinely for idk remember how long. . . . . my face is always like it doesn't matter and idc type.  resting b i t c h face. 
never been much of a social person	celebrating things have never been something i do	so many well dressed and smiling people enjoying their day while i sit here and ponder how i got to this point.   <e1> never been much of a social person </e1>  so  <e2> celebrating things have never been something i do </e2> . but i can`t help being jealous on all the smiling people on the tv that is genuinely smiling, not the fake ass smile i always wear out in public. hope the day is going better for you guys. 
nobody	choices.	nobody really understand what is like having this disgusting mental pain.  they don't know what is like waking up in the morning and having suicidal thoughts and voices that stresses you so bad.  drugs over drugs, my condition is getting worse.  asking for help but nobody really understands even professionals have given up on me.  i am at the edge of life and nobody gives a fuck until i have tramadol and xanax enough to kill myself.  shit life is so much pointless for me.  really. . .  there's nothing and nobody that can help.  i need balls to overdose for real.  i don't have any choices. 
yeah	know.	yeah as the title says.  i disclosed everything including my gender dysphoria, but i still feel empty and blank inside.  i still feel resentment and jealousy towards the opposite sex as well as disgust towards myself and the male sex. yeah, i don't know. 
i came out to my best friend and she completely accepted me	ive never been more grateful	ive been depressed for a couple years and i just had the most amazing day ever.   <e1> i came out to my best friend and she completely accepted me </e1> ,  <e2> ive never been more grateful </e2> .  ive also been getting a lot of attention from my art, and i just wanted to remind everyone out there that the good days still exist.  im currently taking prozac and seeing a therapist, and every day gets a little brighter.  smile ?
hey	this?	hey yall.  just curious if anybody has ever undergone non traditional treatment for depression - not medication or therapy.  i saw some info on tms and vns, and was wondering if anybody had personal experience with treatment like this?
most of my friends ghosted me when quarantine started and the ones i have left are nice but i dont really enjoy being around them anymore	i feel so alone and depressed all the time	im 14m and just dont know what to do with myself anymore.  i dont have any motivation to do anything and i feel lost.  nothing i do brings me any enjoyment anymore and i just feel so sad.   <e1> most of my friends ghosted me when quarantine started and the ones i have left are nice but i dont really enjoy being around them anymore </e1> .   <e2> i feel so alone and depressed all the time </e2>  and even when i do get happy i feel like i dont deserve it.  i just feel like im worthless and that ill never be enough for anyone.  my parents are very nice to me but i dont really want to tell them that i feel this way.  i was wondering if anyone here knew anyways i could make my self feel better. 
i cant act on them	i have a daughter and i'm going to be there for her	i have no friends and i dont feel the need for them i dont see the point and human interaction anymore i dont see how i'm gonna go about fixing things i dont have the enegy to leave my house anymore and i'm just always down i'm trying to imagine my life down the future even if i'm having suicidal thoughts  <e1> i cant act on them </e1>  because  <e2> i have a daughter and i'm going to be there for her </e2>  i just dont know what to do have any of you felt this way and pulled yourself out of it
i made it to adulthood	my life just got even more shitty	congrats  <e1> i made it to adulthood </e1> .  oh  <e2> my life just got even more shitty </e2> .  seriously why should i be happy about this? more responsibilities, more shit to do and more bullshit.  i dont look forward to it.  i really dont.  i have bad depression already and now this gonna make it worse.  i dont have a bright future.  i dont and i even laugh at it.  lollet me sleep forever and never wake up.  plz just end it plz
i hate	they ask about the reason im sad or dont care anymore	 <e1> i hate </e1>  when  <e2> they ask about the reason im sad or dont care anymore </e2>  .  there is none its just how i feel. 
it gets hard	i cant do or talk about everything with her	i (m26)  have been depressed in the past.  it lasted 12 years ish and i have been way better the last 3 years.  last time i got out i just bit myself together and faught away from it by myself.  but that wasnt a cake walk and im not sure i can do it again.  and i am currently falling back in my lonely hole. i havent had anyone but my fiancee for the last 3 years and  <e1> it gets hard </e1>  because  <e2> i cant do or talk about everything with her </e2> .  and its killing me from the inside. . 
she was wary of it	some insurance doesn't cover it	i am on zoloft maxed out and welbutrin 150 ex release and i still feel flat with no real libido.  my med doc suggested tms therapy (magnets on your head) and if that doesn't work ect (aka shock treatment).  i suggested to possibly do a whole system reset with ketamine therapy, and  <e1> she was wary of it </e1>  because  <e2> some insurance doesn't cover it </e2> .  i don't want to keep on being the guinea pig for all of these meds.  i've been on and off them since i was 8.  any suggestions on what choices are the best next step?
so,	be	so, this is my life.  and i want you to know that i am both happy and sad and i'm still trying to figure out how that could be
i want to do something bad	college and my ex	every morning i wake up feeling sad and i'm never happy always feel like everything is on top and that nothing matters and think about doing something bad like i have really dark thoughts every day one of reasons  <e1> i want to do something bad </e1>  is because of  <e2> college and my ex </e2>  and i few more reasons i think i might be depressed not sure and i never had a happy moment since september which is how long i've been feeling like this
i	stuck.	i moved to the east coast away from my extended family 3 years ago.  i was depressed pondered ending my life and went through therapy for a long time to accept my new home.  i just found out were moving to the east coast.  right after ive made friends here accepted this was my new home and fell in love.  i dont understand why life hates me.  everything ive built is being taken away from me again.  no one seems to care or understand.  all i wanted was to stay in one place why is that so hard?? it felt like a joke from life.  right after i overcome moving here they move me somewhere else .  i feel like giving up.  ik i cant kill myself and i shouldnt and so i just feel stuck. 
im irritating myself	being a terrible person and blaming others	my life is perfect.  amazing parents, stable living, i have nothing to complain about.  yet for no reason im still depressed and suicidal when theres no reason.  my life has never been shitty.  i lost some internet friends ive never met? big deal, i dont even know them.  getting bullied? im not, i think i am but  <e1> im irritating myself </e1>  for  <e2> being a terrible person and blaming others </e2> .  i take from the title of depressed and im just an edgy teenager wholl get out of this phase.  the only reason youre reading this is because im such a goddamn piece of shit that doesnt shut the fuck up.  youre reading this instead of someone who needs help, thats my fault. 
ive	happens.	ive been accused twice now for being mentally abusive.  my ex-wife told me i used her as an emotional punching bag.  i reached out to an old girlfriend and she told me the same.  i dont want to be alone, but i dont want to hurt people, traumatize them.  it took me thirty years to admit to myself that i was depressed.  i destroyed those around me with those unchecked emotions.  emotional honesty is the most important part of our lives.  i blew up old friendships for the same reasons.  i look back and ask myself why did you do this? no rational reason exists.  im hopeful that one day ill be able to have an intimate relationship with someone and not damage them with my own problems.  at this point though that is far off; an undiscovered country.  i choose to be alone now so i dont contribute to the suffering anymore.  my apartment is silent and empty and this is the way it will remain until i get better, if that ever happens. 
how	around.	how the hell am i supposed to go one today? today is supposed to be a day of remembrance for a loved one, and i think im supposed to be happy and loving? yet all i have inside of me is anger and rage today.  ive been trying hard to not get into a fight , which typically isnt an issue for me. . im a hot head but easily calmed.  ive been running rapid all week already.  lets see what today entails of, hopefully things turn around. 
i got a dark face that looks like serena williams color but a light body like halle berry	im depressed over this	fuck life.  am i really stuck with this dark face? forreal?! <e1> i got a dark face that looks like serena williams color but a light body like halle berry </e1> .  people tell me and treat me less attractive now. i have tried peels, sunscreen, and hydroquinone.  im still dark!! <e2> im depressed over this </e2>  and i want to jump off a bridge. you dont know what it feels like to be pretty for years then all of a sudden ugly because youve gotten dark. 
the rainy days	it just makes my rather sad and inclusive thoughts increase	for the books, entirely.  to set the mood it has been raining off and on in my area for the past couple of days.  i either love  <e1> the rainy days </e1>  and often use them for house cleanup days, or  <e2> it just makes my rather sad and inclusive thoughts increase </e2> .  its one or the fucking other.  ? ontop of this, i have been getting utter shit for sleep as of late to add on another layer of bullshit.  and then today happens. . .  i get the call right after dinner that my mother, (recently suffered two strokes and a hip replacement ten months prior and a lifelong diabetic) has a few days left to be on this earth.  my mother, my best friend and mom wrapped into one person.  my mother, the woman i stopped everything in my life for seven months, i bathed her.  fed her.  took for strolls in her wheelchair any chance i could.  gave medicine and insulin shots three times a day, daily. . . is about to leave my life forever. its like my brain refuses to believe its happening already. . . my siblings and i all go to say our goodbyes tomorrow morning. . . it'll probably be my last time to see her. 
kept me here for so long	im muslim and offing yourself is a big sin and youre promised to go to hell	how do you know if youre depressed? i dont know if im depressed or theres something wrong with me but today has been really tough and emotional day for me.  i remember taking a bath a couple hours a go and sitting in the tub and now i see i have all these scars on my thighs.  i dont even remember doing this to myself but i just remember just playing with the razor.  i feel like i have been depressed for as long as i can remember but at the same time i feel like im faking everything for attention but no one knows so im just confused.  tbh im tired of living in this world and im ready to go.  the only thing that  <e1> kept me here for so long </e1>  is that  <e2> im muslim and offing yourself is a big sin and youre promised to go to hell </e2>  and at this point im ok with that.  also im broke so i cant even get diagnosed or get a therapist
i dont want help or need any help anymore	i dont deserve it	so i want to send a message to my therapist but worried its going to come across wrong.  i need to send it somewhere to get it off my chest.  sorry if its nothing. i wish i was dead.  i realised i cant form bonds and now pushed people away and just become a toxic person towards people so they dont get close.  im more self aware that im a terrible person and hate myself even more.   <e1> i dont want help or need any help anymore </e1>  because  <e2> i dont deserve it </e2> . 
what's	.	what's the point. . .  no one cares about what i think anymore. . .  i'm just their pawn in. . .  their big game of chess. . .  one wrong move. . .  and the bored stops. . .  the only way to win. . .  is to get to the end. . .  but even then i'm just a copy. . .  of what they already have. . .  a wall. . .  just to save them from check. . .  so they win the set. . .  as i stand in the rubble. . .  see this isn't a game. . .  it's life. . . 
i	better?	i hear people saying im working on myself what the fuck does that mean? ive been depressed forever and dont want to hurt anymore.  is there like a process for getting better?
maybe ill just never open it	i know im never going to deserve it	i feel like i dont deserve it its got a mug and two t-shirts in it  <e1> maybe ill just never open it </e1>  because  <e2> i know im never going to deserve it </e2>  update: i opened it the stuff is nice but i still dont feel like i deserve it
i havent ever felt the connection to talk about my emotions with them	i figured that i could tell my sister	well today was the day that i finally confessed my struggles to my older sister.  im a 20y/om in college and ive been dealing with horrible depression and anxiety basically since i started college, im a junior now.  i wish i could say i knew the cause of this but there are so many factors that make me feel like im not supposed to be on this earth.  i tried to commit suicide almost 2 years ago and ive been battling suicidal thoughts pretty much everyday since then.  well today i finally found the courage to tell my sister my struggles, i told her how i have felt for the past 2-3 years and i could tell that it shocked her but i felt like she needed to know.  my parents are still in my life but  <e1> i havent ever felt the connection to talk about my emotions with them </e1>  so  <e2> i figured that i could tell my sister </e2>  in hopes that she will relay the message and maybe i will be able to discuss the issues with my parents now.  im sorry for the rant but i felt like i just needed a place to tell someone. 
i	need	i will be happy i will be positive i will make it i will find happiness i will find someone life does get bettertoday i woke up and thought i dont want to live like this anymore so these are the way im going to look at it every time i have a bad day!im hoping that this might help other peoples motivation as it is what some people need
my	none.	my whole lifes been a failure and its my parents fault.  i can point countless mistakes they made during their lives but the biggest one was to have a kid without being able to raise them properly.  i mean if ur poor, why tf having kids ? kids have needs, kids demand attention, kids are expensive. . .  so if ur not ready to give your kids what they want and need, then close your fucking legs.  were not supposed to pay for our parents mistakes.  and to make things worse we cant choose our families.  its something that is imposed to us.  if i could choose, id choose a rich family without a single doubt.  cuz all the problems i have now are cuz i dont have money enough so yeah, money is all need to be happy and i have none. 
nobody cares about my health anymore	i'm at a healthy weight now	i feel like i'm living a nightmare, i can't recognize myself in the mirror. . . after forced recovery from anorexia i've been weight restored and relapsed into bulimia which is making me gain unnecessary weight.  basically my worst nightmare has come true and i see no way out of it.  i don't even want to walk cause i'll feel my body moving and get overwhelmed with panic.  my body isn't mine anymore. i'm always home alone and  <e1> nobody cares about my health anymore </e1>  cause  <e2> i'm at a healthy weight now </e2> .  but the reality is every day has become a struggle, i can't go on living like this.  i'm so done i don't even feel like trying anymore. any help? please :(
sadly i cannot kill myself	it would destroy my gf and probably she ll never recover	no, this won't be a post about how i've been a good boy and how i took my happy pills.  this will be about the fact that i hate improving myself in any way.  i play cs go, but i hate to properly learn spray patterns, or how to throw grenades, etc.  that's an example for everything in my life.  i just hate effort.  every time i have to do school work i will end up with anger, frustration and suicidal thoughts.  speaking of,  <e1> sadly i cannot kill myself </e1>  because  <e2> it would destroy my gf and probably she ll never recover </e2> .  also, my concentration ability and memory are long gone.  what the fuck am i even supposed to do? be forced to live a life that i don't want? i never asked for this. 
im a disappointment	not staying	i hate who i am, i hate what i stand for, i hate every little thing about me. . .  im 19, and have been mentally abused for years by my step mother and was forcefully (by my own methods that ended in her calling a bitch and a little shit) removed from that home. . .  everyday i think to myself why didnt i just stay there and take the abuse and torment.   <e1> im a disappointment </e1>  for  <e2> not staying </e2> . . . my gf tries to help she just doesnt know how when im far gone in my mind. . . . .  i dont know what to do anymore. . . . .   living hurts more and more. . . .  what is wrong with me, why cant i just be happy with life. . . .  why does everyone want to fix me by pretending im faking my life. . . i cant be happy, i cant be ok. . .  everywhere i go im reminded of what ive fucked up in life. . .  all i hear is her saying look at how much you fucked up this timewhy should i stay if this is what im going though. . . .  why me. . . 
covering the full mirror at the entrance closet	the more often you see yourself the more you hate the person you see and the more it reminds you that you are stuck within that person forever knowing you will never be happy again	putting away mirrors, and also  <e1> covering the full mirror at the entrance closet </e1>  because  <e2> the more often you see yourself the more you hate the person you see and the more it reminds you that you are stuck within that person forever knowing you will never be happy again </e2>  - it just sabotages to destroy yourself unknowingly, up to the point of thinking of suicide. 
like	man?	like there's people that look in the mirror and like what they see?? that don't feel heaviness in their chest every single second of their lives?? that smile all the time absolutely sincerely?? that hang out with friends and never once feel like a nuisance or feel insecure for how they talk?? that can study and work without feeling completely stupid and useless??how man?
i	on	i dont find joy in shit anymore and the world continues to let me down time n time again.  i dont have much energy left to pick back up the pieces of my life even though im currently unemployed and dont have much else going on
i finally cleaned my room after months	i was so proud i showed my mom	 <e1> i finally cleaned my room after months </e1>  and  <e2> i was so proud i showed my mom </e2> .  it was embarrassing to be proud of just having something that normal people already do but it made me feel a little less hopeless
title	complicated?	title pretty much says it all.  i want to be with friends but get annoyed so fast whenever im around them.  i want to be in a relationship with the girl i like, but also cant wait for it to not work out.  i just want to be alone but im tired of being lonely.  whys this gotta be so complicated?
i	to?	i feel like theres nothing left to say.  everything is horrible and theres no changing it.  does anyone else ever just stop talking because theyre too depressed to?
imagine	bullshit.	imagine there was no stigma around death and depression, and our future generations had a store or a service that sold pain free death. . . i think if we had this choice to live, people will act more responsibly in how they treat others - cause now there are real consequences to them treating others like shit.  then its not on the depressed person to just feel better, its on the society to treat each other well and give everyone a life they cherish. i want to see a world where we make sure everyones life feels good and like a gift, instead of this ill treat you like shit and you just have to live with it cause you have no other option bullshit. 
i've been struggling with my weight ever since elementary school	feel very insecure about my body	i went to church today a woman decided to tell me that i shouldn't be wearing a dress if i i have chubby arms and stretchmarks because i don't look beautiful enough  <e1> i've been struggling with my weight ever since elementary school </e1>  and i can't seem to lose that 27 lb i'm not obese i'm just a tiny bit chubby and yet people like this make me  <e2> feel very insecure about my body </e2>  people like this are the reason that i wear jackets in the summer to school people like this are the reason why i like wearing masks because it hides the double chin and the thing was she said it in front of everyone(edit: thanks to everyone who tried to make me feel better it means alot)
i do something and it makes me happy i feel like ive been lying to myself about being depressed	it makes me feel so sick to my stomach	sometimes when  <e1> i do something and it makes me happy i feel like ive been lying to myself about being depressed </e1>  and  <e2> it makes me feel so sick to my stomach </e2> . 
i am crying	i am so proud of myself	i have been suffering from depression from about 3 months now.  i have gone through breakup of sort.  my anxiety kicked in .  from the past few months i didnt even have had energy to wake up, shower or eat.  i stopped cleaning my room, doing laundry or any basic things.  i never even opened my window blinds.  today after a long time i felt okay .  i opened my blinds, cleaned my room and did my laundry.  these may look like very basic things but somehow  <e1> i am crying </e1>  because  <e2> i am so proud of myself </e2> .  i hope this continues and i feel okay again.  i gave up on feeling happy or joyful a long time ago.  all i want is just to be okay.  hope everyone else is doing good. 
ive	everyday.	ive never been so depressed in life.  and i hate it.  i havent felt like myself in forever.  and im so hopeless and tired of feeling the same way everyday. 
i just dont like communicating	there is literally no point in talking, especially if everything i say is gonna be ignored or criticized	whats the point? hows it gonna help me.   <e1> i just dont like communicating </e1> .  its not like im afraid too but  <e2> there is literally no point in talking, especially if everything i say is gonna be ignored or criticized </e2> .  now that i think about it.  i honestly hate talking to people and hate people in general.  im that talkative anyway, everyone especially my family says that im more quite.  when im around my friends i talk more than when im with my family, but even with my friends sometimes i just dont see the point in talking.  i hate talking.  :/
im scared to meet people in person	i know theyre judging me	i hate how i look.   <e1> im scared to meet people in person </e1>  because  <e2> i know theyre judging me </e2> .  im the ugliest one in my whole family and i just hate it.  no guy ever likes me for me they just like the one decent quality i have (my butt) it feels like both my looks and personality are never enough to keep guys around.  plus im just a sad virgin whos only been kissed by some dude who ended up biting me and leaving marks all over me.  i hate myself ill never ever find love. 
yall	man	yall ever just sit down and think bout how youre wasting the time you have? if someone killed me right now, my life would have meant nothing.  nothing to me and nothing to others.  day by day goes by and here i am, an 18yo with few friends, a fucked up family, no skills, no passions and no motivation.  i cant even recall the last time i was truly happy.  life honestly isnt worth living for the few highs you have once in a blue moon man
i feel way better	typing this	every since school closed and my friends kinda just abound me.  i feel like different i no longer feel like i use to.  i bought a new pc and a lot of new video games and i still feel down.  life has just gotten so boring i have no one to talk to.  covid changed the person i was and i dont like it.  i dont know i feel just hella lonely no friends nothin to be happy about and nothing to look forward to.  i think people see me as a fat wired  kid i never talked as a kid.  probably why i have issues talking with people.  i dont know maybe i just need friends. i need to get my life going again i cant keep feeling like this.  thank you to whoever read this  <e1> i feel way better </e1>  after  <e2> typing this </e2> . 
my	:)	my ex broke up with me months ago (back in march) and i still cant get her off my mind, i care about her way too much.  im just attached, my emotions are starting to overwhelm me.  i told her how i felt and she rejected to get back together.  i just wanna feel loved, i miss the only person that cared if i existed or not.  i miss having her wrap her arms around me and tell me that she loves me, i miss her so muchedit: damn 0_0, alot has changed since then.  ive moved on way past her and actually got another girlfriend.  me and my ex dont talk anymore, and i think thats a good thing.  im very happy with my girlfriend and very happy with where i am in life right now.  thank you to everyone who dmed me asking if i was okay :)
i don't have any friends	sad seeing my boyfriend with his friends and i'm all alone with no girlfriends	 <e1> i don't have any friends </e1>  and it makes me  <e2> sad seeing my boyfriend with his friends and i'm all alone with no girlfriends </e2> . . 
hi,	in.	hi, my name is stefan and ive been suffering with mental health issues for a very long time.  i am now 32 and have absolutely nothing to show for my life except extreme depression accompanied by frequent drug use to escape reality.  i never sleep and feel like im alone in a dark void that i cant escape from.  i cant talk to people in person and feel like its all going to come crashing down any time now.  i dont know if writing this will help or not.  guess im just scared and trying to reach out as some sort of last ditch attempt for any info that can help bring a little hope and light into this living hell i find myself in. 
they know that they don't want to shoulder your burdens	so you're left shouldering them yourself	you're always deemed as complaining, whining, being dramatic. how are you supposed to let out negative thoughts and feelings if you're always discouraged from talking about them?people will say aww, whats wrong? but  <e1> they know that they don't want to shoulder your burdens </e1> .  <e2> so you're left shouldering them yourself </e2> . . . as always. just an endless cycle. 
me	day	me and my mom had a talk at my depression and it felt really nice.  i felt like something was actually listening to me and what i had to say.  this is my first post ever and i just wanted to say that my mom is awesome for understanding and sitting down with me when i was crying.  i just let all my bottle emotions out. thank you mom and for anyone reading thisi hope you can open up as well anyway have a amazing day
just	it.	just sat at the side of my bed for a half hour with a knife, i kept putting it to my wrist prepping myself for what comes next but i couldn't. . .  i couldn't pull the knife down my wrist and i don't know why.  it's what i feel like i want, i didn't feel fear or anything. . .  i felt ready but in the end i just put the knife down, got into bed and that was that. i don't understand why, i keep thinking about it more often than not, i keep justifying it to myself, why it would be better amd why it's okay to do so, but in the end i still put the knife down.  i hope it means that i don't want to and that apart of me has reason to stay but in that moment there wasn't thought or feeling just the bliss of being ready to put an end to it. but i. . .  couldn't do it. 
i'm	posting.	i'm bipolar and it's not what some people think it is.  i'm 51 and have dealt with my mental illness since i was 13-14.  i've never had any real happy mania.  my mania is call mixed episodes or dysphoric.  mix depression with mania and anxiety an times that by 10.  but depression is my main issue.  just posting. 
im just sad	i dont think he thinks abt me anymore	its been two years and i still miss them, does this pain ever go away? i just feel so empty.  i dont feel like anyone will ever make me feel that make again, but hes moved on.  i should be happy for him, but  <e1> im just sad </e1>  and  <e2> i dont think he thinks abt me anymore </e2> .  i dont think life is worth it without him. 
i'm	loved	i'm slowly starting to accept myself but its not been easy.  i keep doubting myself.   i feel insecure about my body i just wanted to feel comfortable with myself.   i want things to feel natural and to feel loved
i	much?	i hate everything.  i hate my life.  i hate my job.  i have no friends besides online friends.  nothing i do to try to better myself works.  i try to reach out but no one actually gives a flying fuck about me.  i just feel so done with everything.  i wish it would all just stop or a piano would just come crashing down and crush my body into a death pancake.  i dont understand why people hate me so much?
im	happy.	im not happy often.  hardly ever.  but when i get a little of bit joy out of nowhere the demon inside my head just snaps at me and says no you cant be happy. 
i make everyone feel just as i do	how sad i get	one emotion after another.  i can never get a break from myself.  im either crying or raging in minutes.  my head is so cloudy and empty, so much confusion for one person.   <e1> i make everyone feel just as i do </e1>  because of  <e2> how sad i get </e2> . .  even after im done with all that intense sadness im quick to recover and things are back to the way they were before.  but things can quickly collapse too.  i dont even know how to properly function anymore, i dont even feel as if i exist but yet i feel like i take up too much space with being around. its so helpless to even be here anymore, to even try, to even just breathe. . .  i want my last days to finally come so once and for all i wont feel so much all alone over and over again. . . 
all my relationships have ended	they get bored of me	ive had a lot of shitty things happen to me (as has everyone else), but i feel like sad things just keep happening over and over again for the past 6 years.   <e1> all my relationships have ended </e1>  because  <e2> they get bored of me </e2>  even though i have so much love that i give them that i dont understand why im so undesirable after they get to know me.  ive had an ectopic pregnancy that nearly killed me.  my living situation with my parents is unhealthy and they dont respect my privacy or my opinion. bottom line is that ive had hope after all of these things that something good is coming, but i just end up disappointed constantly and i dont know how much longer i can live under the illusion that i will be happy.  because at this point it feels like im being delusional to think that life will get better, because so far it hasnt. 
i talked to the text helpline im not sure if the people are bots on it	im really down	i attemped suicide and it didnt work.   <e1> i talked to the text helpline im not sure if the people are bots on it </e1> .   <e2> im really down </e2>  rn and if i dont get support im gonna attempt again. 
you	feelings.	you know what? fuck depression.  fuck anxiety.  fuck all those negative feelings.  it's like when i try speaking out about my feelings i feel a noose tightening around my neck, but i won't let it stop me this time.  ill push those feelings back, i cant let them control me this time.  i will be fine.  i am okay.  there isnt a need to panic.  i won't let the devil take control of me anymore.  i am me.  i am not my depression.  i am not my anxiety.  i am young, i have potential, i have family, i have friends, i have a boyfriend.  i can get through this.  and i swear to god i will not let those negative emotions get the best of me and destroy me.  when they push me down i will get back up and scream a big ol fuck you to those emotions.  so, moral of the story is fuck negative feelings. 
i	trip.	i made the tremendous mistake of smoking by myself during one of my depressed states and i can say i definitely almost fell of the deep end.  my mind started to race a mile a minute thinking about how much i fucked up, and how much i hated other.  i cried and cried during the puffs.  just when it couldn't get worse i started hearing voices, whispers, people screaming in my head telling me things trying to drag me down. .  holy shit that was a trip. 
i	me.	i am the emotional support in my group of friends.  they always text me when they feel depressed and i text them to ask if they are ok every time they havent texted in awhile.  so im sitting in my room waiting for a text just that one question.  i just want someone to genuinely listen and not just to feel obligated to ask me. 
what	help	what i mean by that is. . . . i have told my boyfriend multiple times that i want to die and that i am hopeless and feel completely empty.  i know he is going to leave me.  he looks at me with cold, disgusted eyes now.  about ten minutes ago, i reminded him that that is how i still feel and told him how goddamn sad i am.  he replied, i think you're just being dramatic. is he right? or is he an asshole? i'm losing my mind right now and need some fucking help
someone	well	someone came up to me and said hey what are u thinking about you got a serious face on, i realized i dont think at all my brain is completely shut down anyone just not think or is it just me? or maybe im just not creative? idk what id want to be thinking of but i know a lot of people are always constantly over thinking i just dont have that ability may be a good thing im also emotionally numb as well
not	feelings.	not gonna make a novel about my life, basically i had a group of friends that i had for a pretty long time and i opened up to them about my suicide attempt and my depression and they pretended like they cared for a bit but a few weeks later they started making jokes out of what i had told them and i feel like it's my fault for opening up in the first place and i feel like the world is just telling me to bottle up all my feelings and that i should be cynical but i don't want that.  now i have a new group of friends that really do care about me and while i still don't feel happy i feel like i have people to talk to about my feelings. 
if you dont expect anything you wont get disappointed	i just dont give it hope anymore	dont worry.  i just decided to give up on getting better. i know its a cliche.  everyones saying that  <e1> if you dont expect anything you wont get disappointed </e1> .  so  <e2> i just dont give it hope anymore </e2> . i wake up and go to bed everyday hopeless, knowing exactly im still trapped in this shithole.  everyday is the same.  im suicidal but i have been like this for so long its becoming like one of my characteristics now.  i dont and i cant do anything to help me feel better and im okay with it?im sorry that my post is a mess.  i guess all im saying is maybe this is normal, maybe nothing is normal.  so just keep going?have a normal day everyone. 
its	.	its past 4 in the morning again and im just staring at my ceiling praying silently in my head to a god who may or may not be there maybe im just crazy.  i think ive cried in the bed for 8 years all throughout high school and even now . . .  i dont know what to do at this point when i cry i dont feel anything i just have tears running down no emotions whatsoever.  constantly replaying regret after regret in my head.  i just want to be happy and i dont know how to be im always feeling so lost. . . . . 
how	timeframe.	how can i overcome daily suicidal thoughts that last 1 to 4 hours.  every day i have 1 to 4 hours where i have extreme suicidal thoughts.  but after those 1 to 4 hours i feel fine and can moove on with my day.  but they do come back if i dont go to bed in time.  so my question is what can i do to survive those 1 to 4 hours and not kill myself so i can have some peace after that timeframe. 
i feel sad	it could've been avoided	 <e1> i feel sad </e1>  bc  <e2> it could've been avoided </e2> .  they could've gotten help and lived, it wasn't their time.  but i also feel like i wish i had the courage to actually pull the plug like they did. 
i cant control my emotions	when ever i am with them its just not me its just some unknown one	i like to sleeep all day long and do nothing else but now that i am in my home its sooo i dont even know how to describe it.  my parents want me to sleep and wake up early, but how can i explain them that i dont sleep coz i cant, even if i say them i know their response , becoz u use phone a lot or becoz u sleep in the evening.  i do want to end everything but i cant its hard maybe i am a coward oh i think i am.  i cant study its more like i cant concentrate.  they are the best parents someone can have but just not me.  i dont want to do anything i just want to sleeep all my life but thats impossible without me ending.  i try to stay calm and listen to them but  <e1> i cant control my emotions </e1> .   <e2> when ever i am with them its just not me its just some unknown one </e2> .  i dont hate studying but i dont even like it. 
i	understand.	i don't really talk much about being low or troubled.  it doesn't really feel like anyone would understand.  but people expect me to either tell them or get over it.  now, i see where they come from, i act weird, cold and distant a lot.  they are obviously tired of asking me.  what do i do? is not telling them 'bout it selfish of me? or do i pretend to be alright for their sake?i would tell them but i really don't want all the pity that would follow.  i just want someone to understand. 
i	welcome.	i have been alone and unloved for as long as i can remember.  my friend started dating a girl he met out of the blue and is so punch-drunk in love that when he came over for board games last night, not a single minute went by when they weren't giggling, touching, or flirting like children.  it has been ages since i have been touched that way intimately. . .  and i just don't know how long my body can physically go without that.  i want to check out of this miserable hotel, i have overstayed my welcome. 
im	do.	im no longer the person i used to be or i dont want to. i dont want to be bubbly anymore. i dont want to talk to anyone and vice versa. i want to become so cllosed off,. im basically feeding my depression, but depressed me is way better than happy me. i dont want to be who i am anymore i want to change for the worst.  well not worst but you get my point?i hate it when people say i should be myself, truth is myself is absolute shitim going to sink een deeper, believe every voice in my head, heck i deserve the pain anyways,i deserve to be depressed, so thats what ill do. 
i	goes.	i won't lie and say i've got a ton of relationship experience.  i'm a bipolar shut in who stays inside as much as he can.  i've been in 2 major relationships in my life, both of which cheated on me within the first 3 months.  i just don't really see a point in staying open you know? i just think that i would be better off sticking to my normal ways.  i've got anxiety and depression to top it all of so i guess the best decision would be to give up on relationships until i figure out the rest right? it's just really hard for me to make progress without seeing an endpoint for myself.  i pride myself on being logical so i can't help, but believe that there's just no point to working on myself.  honestly, this wasn't supposed to be a rant, but you know how it goes. 
ive	me.	ive always been told that the meaning to life is to have someone you love and have children but i dont believe it.  i tried for so long to find someone to love but everyone has turned me down or just faked being a friend.  it really hurts when i think but that meaning.  i dont think i can do this any longer.  it really feels like i dont belong here and should just end it so people dont have to deal with me. 
.	away.	. . . but then i open my eyes just to realize that i'm still here.  i'm still stuck with no way out.  no happiness. people tell me it doesn't have to be this way.  how can you be so sure?. . . i just don't understand why i can't just fade away. 
why	mode	why do poor people have children and make them be doomed from the start? i'd rather have not been born because life is always on hard mode
when	this???	when i was in highschool i tried to kill myself, obviously it didn't work but i was still hospitalized.  i was asked if i was depressed/suicidal and i just told them i tried to kill myself because i was bored.  afterwards my mother just took me for a shopping trip at the dollar tree and never spoke about it again.  i am so angry about this outcome and blame it for too much of how i'm doing right now, it's hard for me to let go of things and letting go of this specifically is even harder.  it was years ago but i still feel so disrespected and swept under the rug, by my parents, medical professionals, etc.  how do i cope with this???
let	move.	let me start off by saying this isn't a sad post.  rather, it's one coming from someone whose been revealed to the purposelessness of life and how meaningless it all really is.  there are only a few things that happen if i die tonight.  some folks will be sad tomorrow.  someone's going to have to water my plant.  i will be replaced in all regards by someone i am sure is me 3. 0.  i've gone out of my head and seen the void that is existence.  like god wanted me to see how insignificant i really am.  i could lay here and do nothing, or do anything, it really doesn't fucking matter.  play it out, the next action you take, all the way to the end.  change my mind, tell me there is a reason to move. 
i	understands	i cant connect with people anymore.  or maybe people cant connect with me.  i cant help but want to stay in bed i dont really have any reason to leave.  im 25 and have not felt romantic or friendly love since maybe 20/21.  i feel like giving up.  no one understands
doc told me it might cause some tiredness	i always took it at night	so i started taking double my dose after i researched if my body could handle it.  (max dose of fluoxetine is 80mg).  so i was taking 40mg of fluoxetine per day) now the  <e1> doc told me it might cause some tiredness </e1>  so  <e2> i always took it at night </e2> .  after a little while of 40mg, i was still fucked up.  i was getting more and more depressed and less and less anxiety.  i was getting suicidal and had my phase with self-harm. 
i	me.	i have no friends, no family, no job, no hobby, no obligations, no motivation, no drive, no desires, no excitement, no wishes, no hopes, no dreams, no wants or wills.  just nothing.  no reason to get out of bed, and i dont want any. what am i suppose to do when i have nothing and want nothing but also have no drive or motivation to change any of it?iv been to therapy, iv done the drugs, iv tried everything im suppose to and yet here i am, still with nothing. its been over a decade now, when will i finally get the courage needed to end it? will i ever? maybe im doomed to live like this until nature does it for me. 
im constantly battling in my head	part of me wants social interaction	i have always struggled with making and keeping friends.  i recently moved back in with my parents, but they live 15 minutes from the closest small town, and 30/40 minutes away from the city.  even before covid hit i didnt really try to meet new people, but now its almost impossible.   <e1> im constantly battling in my head </e1>  because  <e2> part of me wants social interaction </e2> , but i also dont want to put forth the energy and effort it takes to build and maintain a relationship.  idk, sometimes i feel extremely lonely, other times im happy being completely alone. 
i	world.	i am bipolar, 20m and have suffered sexual abuse.  i do have something to look forward to, but im not sure i can see the light.  its a matter of how much are you willing to take in the short term? my current state is that i am isolated at home no friends in my immediate area, neglectful and casually abusive parents and my abusive brother.  he was the one who sexually abused me.  my parents dismiss my mental health and i feel detached from a girl i love so much.  i honestly dont know how much more i can take.  im currently thinking about suicide.  i dont know how much ill be missed, but people get over death.  it just happens.  im not worthy of love or mourning if im a burden to everyone and the world.  im not meant for this world. 
when	help.	when you feel something other than regret, hurt, loneliness, self-contempt.  days like today where i just feel something thats good for once, like every once in a long while, i dont mind being stuck in this body.  its a liberating feeling that comes and goes like wind, makes me feel happy even just for today, i know ill feel awful again tomorrow.  but at least for today, i felt great, with no one elses help. 
today	worry.	today a friend texted me to ask if i'm okay.  she said i seemed a little off for the past weeks and it was true.  i said yeah just worried about my grades bcuz my midterms were pretty messed up so betting everything on my finals now.  then i typied a whole paragraph explaining that there are other things too, like being away from home for too long (international student studying in the u. s. , haven't been able to go home since sept.  2019), loneliness, sensitive personality, gaining weight, financial issues, etc.  then i deleted the paragraph bcuz who gives me the right to bother others w/ my unhappiness.  i'm now scared to see or hear someone says: let me know if there's anything i can do.  seriously, i can't thank you enough my friend, but there's litterally nothing you can do and i'm sorry that i make you worry. 
i	weird?	i was diagnosed with clinical depression in my teens (my family doesnt know i went to a private clinic for help). since then things just keep going downhill.  but whenever the suicidal thoughts come in i just need a wave of anger to push it all away.  just anger at everyone who ever doubted me, offended me, anger at my miserable rotten luck, and anger to prove them wrong just one more time, to just keep going one more step to prove everything wrong. i dunno if anyone else feels the same way.  perhaps this anger is a symptom of my depression but its the only thing keeping me going at times, and i am strangely thankful for it.  does this sound weird?
well	for:)	well today i finally got the balls and took some days off for my mental health.  kinda excited considering these past few months have been rough for me. hopefully this can be a start for change in my life.  gonna try out some the things i used to really enjoy and used to live for:)
it's	day.	it's weird, i constantly think of killing myself and i hate everything, but i'm okay.  i feel like i'm faking depression.  i can't explain it properly, but it's basically this i'm at rock bottom, but it's fine since i have a house there. usually it's just nothing at all and that's okay, but sometimes i also feel like i'm bottling everything up, because the bottle gets very close from opening.  most of the time i don't even know if the bottle is real, but whenever i get a minor inconvenience i am much more sad then i should be. idk if this even makes sense but i feel like if i can, usually, live normally and be okay, those times were i can't must be my fault, like somehow i am letting it happen when i shloudn't be.  rationally i know i'm not choosing to go down the depression hole, but i can't stop thinking that if i tried hard enough i could stop and just be okay like every other day. 
since being stuck at home for over a year i havent been able to make any friends at school	i feel isolated from society and disconnected from friends and family	1+ year of online school my only socialization comes in the form of work (department store) which is dreadful all my friends are at uni while im doing cc fully online due to covid.  i have no motivation to start let alone finish assignments.  i feel like my life is no longer worth living.  i used to be a real social guy but  <e1> since being stuck at home for over a year i havent been able to make any friends at school </e1> .   <e2> i feel isolated from society and disconnected from friends and family </e2> .  i think about dying every day just to escape the dreadful cycle.  anything helps
im sad	i look at this sub and see how many others feel the same way as me	 <e1> im sad </e1>  when  <e2> i look at this sub and see how many others feel the same way as me </e2>  its terribleno words
i	years.	i feel like ive developed worse depression since last year.   it was bad last year but its on a different level now.  i feel. . .  literally like a few major lights went out inside.  i feel impending doom frequently and unnecessarily.  ive almost given myself heart attacks from anxiety.  i constantly feel like something very bad is about to happen.  im drained of energy and life.  i sleep 8 hours a night but that honestly doesnt help much.  my ability to feel joy has been significantly reduced.  i mean significantly.  im almost emotionally numb at this point and even paralyzed at certain times.  the thing is good things have recently happened but for some reason i dont respond to them the same way i wouldve used to.  i just used to have such a spark.  i had so much energy and a lot of people told me i was a light in their life.  not the last few years. 
it's been getting worse	the stress of me coming out to my family as lesbian a couple months ago	i've been depressed for i'd say around 6 years now.  and i'm starting to get really worried about the brain fog.  it's been getting so much worse the past few months.  i think that  <e1> it's been getting worse </e1>  due to  <e2> the stress of me coming out to my family as lesbian a couple months ago </e2>  and them not accepting me at all.  i've been very forgetful and learning anything is just extremely difficult.  so i guess i was just wondering, is this a normal thing that happens and will it ever go away?
how	die?	how do you handle being depressed or suicidal but too scared to die?
i	time	i don't want to keep trying to live the same miserable life, and there's not even a point anymore.  never has been.  if i go to sleep and don't wake up it'd be ok with me at this point, that way no one can be disappointed that i took my own life.  i'm sorry.  have a good time
tears	sees	tears flow down your cheeks behind closed doors where you hide from those who do not cry.  you are afraid of no one else shedding tears as often as you.  outside closed doors no one cries, outside closed doors everyone is afraid of tears.  you do not cry in front of anyone else.  everyone thinks you are like them, they do not cry and neither do you, but behind closed doors everyone cries. we all cry where no one sees
i	dying.	i feel empty inside.  i have friends , get girls although nothing meaningful, get above average grades, my family is upper middle class and cares about me.  i just dont feel anything anymore.  i can have fun, joke around and so on, but when i eventually end up by my self in the evenings i feel empty.  thought about ending it, but dont want to put a burden on my family by dying. 
m16	german/russian	m16 here.  i genuinely believe that im just a lazy piece of shit that fakes depression to get some excuses and attention.  im going to a mental hospital in a few weeks so i guess according to my therapist i am mentally ill.  i feel so empty and useless all the time and hate everything about every day but i still feel like ive just faked my way into it, as if im just making this all up, making myself feel bad on purpose.  its to a point where my mind doesnt allow me to feel any joy because. .  well idk. i also dont have any benefits from acting like that, my grades dropped from fairly straight as to ds.  but probably im just making up that im making this all up. sry for bad english im german/russian
i	existence.	i am so tired, depressed and lonely.  i dont even have one single person irl i can talk to.  have abusive family.  zero friends.  this is such a miserable existence. 
for	future.	for the context, i'm an adult in mid 20 that fails being an grown up.  are there people out who's just like me a weirdo? my family doesn't care about the fact that i am slouching my life away.  bad decisions in life to not take action or responsible had led me to being a useless good for nothing person.  i don't know anyone could help except myself, just really embarrassed of myself. i wasn't good at anything like literally even passing, and it's that bad.  the only strength i have is being kind.  i can't help but feels hopeless about my future. 
if	treatment.	if a person has a physical illness it is completely fine but apparently if you have a mental one you're not trying hard enough.  can you tell a person with a walking disability to try to walk better? no.  it would be considered irrational and rude.  how can you tell a person who's dealing with depression to try harder to be better, to do things, to be more social.  i dont even want to try to do anything.  im just so sick of it.  you should be trying harder be more positive others have it worse.  same goes for anxiety.  like i'll be in the middle of an anxiety attack and they'll be like just calm down, go socialise.  try harder.  like, there's literally 0 logic.  so sick of this treatment. 
its	relate?	its got to a point that even writing down how i feel is just no.  anyone relate?
i've	pace?	i've always had this fantasy that maybe i can create something that helps people.  i don't mind sinking my time and even sacrificing my life if it means i can significantly help just one person. but i feel like games that heavily features the topic of depression are self-indulgent and don't actually help people in the bouts of it.  i guess i could code an app but i'm not sure what it would be?i'm not here to get app ideas.  i just wonder what can be done for all the depressed people.  i wish i could be of use.  in what form would you like to see help? ever thought about that?if you can't think of anything that you need then that's okay.  perhaps this thread gave you pause to reflect on your needs.  maybe that's something that you've neglected.  maybe you could break it into manageable pieces and try to pursue it at your own pace?
for	guys?	for me it's mostly my vision of a better tomorrow.  i daydream a lot about getting to a certain point in life.  getting out of my longtime depression, optimizing my life in the best possible way, possibly even finding a proper girlfriend.  i'm really looking forward to the vr technology evolving, for example.  other than that, currently i'd say i enjoy music, porn (lol) and drugs the most.  three things that help me the most getting through life at this moment.  oh, and internet of course.  it's an amazing distraction overall. how about you guys?
i'm	frightening	i'm in the darkest place i think i've ever been you can see from the scars on my face i'm not where i'm supposed to be all alone why have you forsaken me? all alone you make it hard to believe i'm in the darkest place and i don't just mean this jail in my mind there's a darkest space trapped in an even darker cell you got to see it to believe it's true that's why it's so hard to believe in you stay real, but you got to have faith but i wondered where you were when i needed you when that girl was telling lies in the court with her hand on the bible, where was the lightning? the great vengeance, furious anger that samuel.  l. j.  made sound so frightening
about	way	about 4 months ago i hit a walli left my brand new friend group straight up.  i told them i was having a depressive episode and ghosted. they tried to reach out but i couldn't.  i'm afraid i caused more drama by dipping or than if i'd just shared with them what was going on. in the last month i've reached out to 3 of them. i'm also one of the oldest of the group so i feel like i should've had my shit together.  but, i didn't.  so here we are. i feel okay now, but i also feel like i've burned the best, strongest bridges i've built in a long time.  which is threatening to send me spiraling again. i'm so fucking tired of getting in my own way
you	home.	you are a disappointment and will never amount to anything. i should have bought a porsche instead of having you. my dad drank when i was a kid and put me through hell, now you get to deal with it, because you deserve it. sorry your friend died, maybe if you hadn't been grounded you could of been there for him. you're girl left you? maybe if you weren't such a fucking bitch she'd have stuck around, no one wants to take a pussy of a man. i had to quit school and start working because you were born, and you're the reason i'm not successful. maybe if you worked out you wouldn't be so fat and a lazy piece of shit. you're the reason i drink. you're the reason i hate my life. i dread you coming home. 
so	life	so this is probably gonna sound dumb but can life get any worse? so basically my whole life my father figure was just an abusive drunk and my mom i have trust issues with.  i dont trust anyone since that got ruined by my family, and im failing in school too.  i have been depressed for 4 years and while that may not be as bad as some of you i can still relate and understand what this shit is like.  so to go back to my title is life ever getting any better cuz the way everything is goung rn i feel like i'm just gonna end up working a minimum wage job and life in a shitty apartment my entire life
hey,	???	hey, im not here to advertise meds lol i just wanted to check in on my new account:) i feel less suicidal and less in my head all the time.  lets hope i can keep it up! i always thought that i was going to die before i reached my 30th birthday and that might still be, but as of right now i feel good about life ???
at	agree?	at this point in life i've just begun to believe that happiness is just a lie that adults teach kids in order to let them live out their childhoods and let them believe that good people that care about anything other than themselves and their selfish desires actually exist in this world.  like bruh i haven't been happy in over 8 years and you just want to tell me that that's actually thing that grown adults actually feel? am i alone here or do y'all agree?
i	here	i miss the old me so much. . .  i never dealt with suicidal thoughts/depression this hard.  i hate it here
i	this!	i don't know if i can post this here, but does anyone else feel a little better after flipping their pillow to the day side after crying into the other side and making it soaking wet? i'm just curious if anyone relates to this!
i	writing.	i recently made this account just to ask for help.  im a 16 year old male and things have been going down hill.  i had a big crush on a girl for 6 month, i enjoyed every moment i spent just talking to her, i talked to her every day feeling like i was making progress to have something more than a friendship.  anyways she got a boyfriend who seemed everything that she wanted that i wasnt, for 2 weeks i was super sad and it was hard for me to live life with a clear mind, that was 3 months ago tho but for some reason today i feel lonely and that girl comes in my mind often and i start to overthink how ill never get a girlfriend or ill never become anything.  sorry if i wrote this badly im not good with writing. 
i've tried connecting with her emotionally but i am not a very emotional person myself	that's difficult for me	hello my wife suffers from extreme depression and here recently it's been really bad.  she has told me that one day i will come home and she will just no longer be alive.  she broke down exactly what happens when somebody overdoses on tylenol to me last night.  she said that everything disappoints her and that the only option that she wants is to end everything.  i have tried helping her i have tried doing everything that i can think of.   <e1> i've tried connecting with her emotionally but i am not a very emotional person myself </e1>  so  <e2> that's difficult for me </e2> .  she doesn't want to seek professional help anymore because she's done that in the past and it has done nothing for her but disappoint her.  i don't know what to do.  i've tried giving her the best life that i can give her and making sure that she has everything that she could want or need but none of it seems to help and i don't know what to do.  i need a device. 
i	thread.	i woke up just now with this thought.  it's 4 am and i'm not looking forward to the day at all.  i never am.  i'm tired of waking up.  i wish i would just slip away in my sleep.  it's too hard to live and try to get better, i have no hope i'll ever get better.  i've been desperate to die since 2018 when i was actually in a mental hospital for 2 weeks, i realized those people can't help me.  no one can.  i realized during my time in there i'm too far gone, even the other depressed people there didn't share my same sentiments or thoughts.  even in a mental hospital i felt like an outcast and misunderstood.  this world holds no answers for me.  but i just can't bring myself to kill myself.  my family holds me back.  honestly sometimes i think what if i just killed my folks and then myself, that'd be the best outcome. . .  thoughts like these have become normal and i just don't want to try anymore.  i don't want to get better.  i just want to pass away at this point.  i'm hanging on a thread. 
i have crippling depression	why i couldnt come to the party, thats why i couldnt get the work done, thats why i look like shit today, thats why i was late because i had to pick myself up off the floor, cover my bloodshot eyes with makeup and put a fake smile on to pretend im doing just fine and thats why im finally responding to your message 2 weeks later	it would be such a nice break from the pain and from letting people down and from being so tired running on empty from keeping the secret from everyone around me that  <e1> i have crippling depression </e1>  and thats  <e2> why i couldnt come to the party, thats why i couldnt get the work done, thats why i look like shit today, thats why i was late because i had to pick myself up off the floor, cover my bloodshot eyes with makeup and put a fake smile on to pretend im doing just fine and thats why im finally responding to your message 2 weeks later </e2> . its not going away, i get teased by a week or so of being the normal me and think everythings fine again.  i can be so funny and so happy and creative and cool and then i can be the exact opposite.  it makes me feel like im 1000 pounds when im reality i cant remember to eat and dont really care. so would a break from all this really be that bad? this isnt a way to live, my mind is ruining my life and it just doesnt feel worth it anymore. 
i fucking hate my life	i have like 2 friends, who dont even really respond to my message.  everyone looks at me like im a stain on this planet.  also im adopted so i was thrown out like the fucking trash.  birth mom just left me in the hospital, lmaooo.  should have just swallowed or aborted me.  my adoptive parents just constantly judge me for not doing good on a test, going to college etc	im a senior in hs and  <e1> i fucking hate my life </e1> .   <e2> i have like 2 friends, who dont even really respond to my message.  everyone looks at me like im a stain on this planet.  also im adopted so i was thrown out like the fucking trash.  birth mom just left me in the hospital, lmaooo.  should have just swallowed or aborted me.  my adoptive parents just constantly judge me for not doing good on a test, going to college etc </e2> . ive been low key suicidal for awhile, too pussy to do it tho. 
there's	this.	there's nothing that causes my depression to just explode out of control more than things in my life being negatively impacted by circumstances outside my control.  i completely got shit on recently (in another post, i don't feel like retyping it lol)now here i am, surrounded by a bunch of boxes and shit all over the floor in the house where i was supposed to be living with my friends for the rest of the year, before getting a chance to do bigger and better things.  but, because of circumstances outside my control, i have to pack up my shit and leave again. feeling completely out of control and helpless is the literal worst feeling out of anything.  oh, and this also all happened right after i decided to stop taking the antidepressant i had been on for two years (with docs permission), but given that i was still in the hugely unstable phase, it was a fucking disaster.  i think i was more upset the past two weeks than i've ever been. fuck all this. 
i feel so alone not having a friend a family or a gf	i can't sleep well, i can't concentrated at all on all my stuff, my anxiety keep drowning me, my thoughts keep making me over think everything, i get desperate about my future	is been so hard for me to make friends, to fight, to learn, to keep up with myself. . . .  love being alone cause i don't need to hear all that bs everyone say about me but  <e1> i feel so alone not having a friend a family or a gf </e1> ,  <e2> i can't sleep well, i can't concentrated at all on all my stuff, my anxiety keep drowning me, my thoughts keep making me over think everything, i get desperate about my future </e2> , i want to do great but i can't  is like having a million rock on me, doing one thing good but having a hundred step back. i look for someone to share how i feel to make memories or anything, to be better but no one wants to be there, how can i fight if no one can't help me, where is the help when you need it? this is bs, i hate life, i hate my life, i hate everything, this is fu. . . . .  hard, don't you get it!??? is not the same, is not the fu. . . . . . .  same!!!!!
i've	anymore.	i've been depressed for so long now.  i don't enjoy things like i should.  i don't have hobbies, i don't go out and have sober fun.  nothing really makes me happy.  my boyfriend makes me somewhat happy.  he's supportive and hes probably one of the most saner and logical men i have ever been with.  i love him.  i love how he treats me, i love his morals, i love how smart he is.  but sometimes i question if i'm happy with him because i'm just never happy in general.  i catch myself becoming super irritable and i've finally found my voice so when something bothers me instead of being a push over i voice my issues which may make me blow things out of proportion and half the time i can't tell if i am or not anymore. 
my therapist and i realise that theres a very real chance of me never being able to be treated for my depression	so in that case id always have to cope	hello i am luna.  i have struggled with depression ever since i was ten or eleven.  im eighteen now and it has gotten worse.  i am more stable and think more rationally than before.   <e1> my therapist and i realise that theres a very real chance of me never being able to be treated for my depression </e1> .   <e2> so in that case id always have to cope </e2> . if i look at my life id maybe give it a 3 out of ten.  its not like there arent any times when i feel okay.  there are some but mostly i just feel like shit and i am really unmotivated to do anything.  everything i achieve is done because of stress. if im gonna stay as miserable as i am now i just dont see the point in living.  right now im alive for my friends and family only.  im unhappy and i might never truly be happy again. 
i'm just jealous they're so good and i cant keep upare there any methods i can use, or like thoughts or something to help with this	its pretty frustrating	i'm always so tired from being depressed, i just cant do art anymore, its really frustrating seeing my friends improve, and i should be a better friend, but  <e1> i'm just jealous they're so good and i cant keep upare there any methods i can use, or like thoughts or something to help with this </e1> ,  <e2> its pretty frustrating </e2> 
i	cry	i live with my boyfriend and i live him dearly. . . . but im beginning to feel so so depressed that i cant even clean the apartment (i tend to do it more than him now) and i just cant bring myself to go to work somedays even though its an amazing job and i love it so much. my bosses told me to come talk to them tomorrow and im seriously even more messed up now because i just have this feeling that im gonna lose my job or that im gonna fall apart in the meeting and i wont be able to keep it together and be professional. i just found out my abusive dad that i barley see or talk to anymore has cancer so now i have mixed feelings about that, and it just feels like the only thing i can do is eat and sleep.  but i have barley eaten. not to mention that i just feel like shit because my bf isnt really affectionate and i just. . . . i need help. . . i seriously fantasized about just disappearing into my bed sheets all day today.  just wanting to die. . . . . i just need to be held while i cry
hello	others	hello redditorsi just realised that i'm now finally starting to feel better.  i started to take the recommended medications seriously and not taking them random. though i honestly find it strange to feel better and i ask myself why am i happy and if i merit it.  i'm still hard on myself and have my down days and especially in the evening.  i still find it hard to accept that i have depression even if my therapist is telling me. now i doubt if i really have depression and that it was all made up as an excuse and attention seeking. my therapist still wants that i go in a psychiatric clinic, since there is still a lot of work to do but i tell myself that i shouldn't, i'm an impostor for asking so much help and that i should handle it alone. so just wanted to tell you to keep battling, that there is an ending and to listen to experts even if it sounds difficult to rely on others
im	everything.	im a simple guy.  i just wanted a decent job.  a roof over my head, and not live to pay bills.  if theres rock bottom im there. i came to the realization that im an alcoholic recently.  i drink everyday and i dont think drinking half a bottle then taking some adderall so that i could drive to buy more drinks is what a normal person does.  im completely filthy right now and so is my living area.  i havent conducted any hygiene for days.  i dont care about anything anymore.  im not even disgusted at my own behavior.  i have nobody.  i just want to run away but theres nowhere to run.  its getting bad.  i barely have any motivation left.  its hard to keep trying and failing at everything. 
im	else	im on 40mg fluoxetine, was on 20mg but on first month of higher dose, been taking it a year but recently im feeling really hungry all the time to the point if i havent eaten for a couple of hours i get that shaky weak feeling, im craving sweet things when i didnt used to, would it be the medication causing this? im getting more depressed about how i look than anything else
i	way.	i am having a very terrible day dealing with depression as a result of these fatalistic indicators of inferiority such as a high 2d4d ratio and weaker physical traits.  i have the dread that i will never be good enough in a technical field or an artistic field.  quite frankly, i feel so useless, like a genetic failure.  why must i keep on going?call this absurd.  i sure wish i could see it that way. 
that's been delayed	i got covid and i'm isolated in my room	im failing university and i'm wasting my parents money on rent, food, gambling and drugs.  i've been depressed for the past 4 years and i see absolutely no way out. .  i have no ambition, and i'm a disappointment to my parents who sacrificed everything for me.  almost everyone i know is doing something with their lives and im just existing and i was hoping i was going to achieve way more than i did till now.  im supposed to start therapy soon, but  <e1> that's been delayed </e1>  cause  <e2> i got covid and i'm isolated in my room </e2>  and that's making my situation even worse
m16	german/russian	m16 here.  i genuinely believe that im just a lazy piece of shit that fakes depression to get some excuses and attention.  im going to a mental hospital in a few weeks so i guess according to my therapist i am mentally ill.  i feel so empty and useless all the time and hate everything about every day but i still feel like ive just faked my way into it, as if im just making this all up, making myself feel bad on purpose.  its to a point where my mind doesnt allow me to feel any joy because. .  well idk. i also dont have any benefits from acting like that, my grades dropped from fairly straight as to ds.  but probably im just making up that im making this all up. sry for bad english im german/russian
i fucking hate my life	i have like 2 friends, who dont even really respond to my message.  everyone looks at me like im a stain on this planet.  also im adopted so i was thrown out like the fucking trash.  birth mom just left me in the hospital, lmaooo.  should have just swallowed or aborted me.  my adoptive parents just constantly judge me for not doing good on a test, going to college etc	im a senior in hs and  <e1> i fucking hate my life </e1> .   <e2> i have like 2 friends, who dont even really respond to my message.  everyone looks at me like im a stain on this planet.  also im adopted so i was thrown out like the fucking trash.  birth mom just left me in the hospital, lmaooo.  should have just swallowed or aborted me.  my adoptive parents just constantly judge me for not doing good on a test, going to college etc </e2> . ive been low key suicidal for awhile, too pussy to do it tho. 
i'm pretty nervous	not knowing what to do, how to open up to them, and from hearing others bad expirences with past therapists on reddit	soon i'll be having my first therapist appointment and  <e1> i'm pretty nervous </e1>  based on  <e2> not knowing what to do, how to open up to them, and from hearing others bad expirences with past therapists on reddit </e2> . any ideas for what i should do when going in?
it's frustrating	i don't even know why the fuck i've been feeling like this since 2 years ago	well i felt my day was overwhelmed and i randomly started to cry when the bus was empty.  i wish i knew why i cried and honestly  <e1> it's frustrating </e1>  that  <e2> i don't even know why the fuck i've been feeling like this since 2 years ago </e2> . 
i still have more years to go	this is a life long battle	i joined this sub a few years ago.  had reached a low point starting from when my grandmother died and reaching a head when i was broke, hungry, and homeless.  now im still pretty broke, not as hungry, and 50% homeless, but i have stopped feeding into the negative thoughts about myself and my situation.  life is already hard, i shouldnt give it an easier time beating me down.  which is easy to say, but that the change isnt instantaneous.  its taken me 3 years, and  <e1> i still have more years to go </e1>  cause  <e2> this is a life long battle </e2> .  but i refuse to bow down and let depression win.   i know my story isnt everyone elses story, but if i can keep fighting and start winning i know all of you can. 
it resulted in an eating disorder	i thought if i got a flat chest and a flat ass then i would not be provocative or something	i am female 19 and my bf is male 22.  we have dated for about 1. 5 years. my boyfriend called me a few hours ago and voiced his concerns about genetics in children.  he noted that i have had an eating disorder, struggles with feelings of depression, and anxiety.  he is concerned that this would be passed down to children. while i understand and share his concerns, i do not think he has the full picture. a few years ago i experienced sexual assault multiple times.   <e1> it resulted in an eating disorder </e1>  because  <e2> i thought if i got a flat chest and a flat ass then i would not be provocative or something </e2> .  i basically just felt really ashamed and at fault for what happened. . . so i starved myself.  i also was left with feelings of anxiety and depression because. . . no shit. no one in my family has/had an eating disorder, depression, or anxiety disorder. my point is that my struggles were environmentally and not genetically caused. to be fair, i had never told him about the assault because there never was a good time to bring it up and i felt comfortable around him so i just didnt wanna think back to it or talk about it. 
depression	do?	depression has taken a great hold of me this particular important year!!!! there are a lot of things that i have to study but i'm too afraid of failure to do them, sometimes i think that i'm stupid, sometimes people discourage me, i also have had some kind of addiction before which has destroyed my mental state, i can't think clearly now.  even the school therapist has made fun of me because of my depression, i have never felt angrier.  even seeing my friends discussing physics problems and i haven't even opened a single goddamn lesson of this subject makes me angry and envious of them, because i have been always on the top of my class for the last 7 years but now my life is ruined because of my addiction and depression.  what should i do?
ive	person.	ive dealt with anxiety and depression my whole life.  ive been in therapy my whole life and recently started up again.  i have an amazingly supportive family. today i had a mental breakdown at work.  this is third in the year and a half ive been there.  it pays well, but its so demanding and overwhelming and it wrecks me 3/5 days or more each week. i dont feel like my depression is justified, but i cant help it.  it was a full on panic attack.  crying, puking, hyperventilating. i told my supervisor what was going on and she let me take the rest of the day off.  i feel so ashamed and embarrassed.  i just got done with a 4 day weekend.  that was supposed to be my time to recoup. i dont know why i cant function like a normal person. 
i stay up late into the night	i don't want the day to end	every day i fight with myself.   <e1> i stay up late into the night </e1>  because  <e2> i don't want the day to end </e2> .  not because i'm enjoying it, but simply because i just don't want to wake up in the morning and start the day all over again. however, when i wake up in the morning, all i want to do is sleep more.  sleep longer.  sleep forever. i hate starting a new day knowing that it's going to be exactly the same thing as the day before it, and the hundreds of days before that. i have nothing to look forward to.  nothing to be excited about.  nothing to propel me forward and convince me to keep going. i feel like i'm stuck in some kind of limbo.  perpetually caught between awake and asleep, not wanted to be a part of either. i don't know what to do anymore.  i could use some advice from anyone that feels they suffer the same injustices of life. take care of yourselves out there. .  and each other. 
i	enough.	i miss my dog so much.  i am glad we brought him home but i wish we brought him home alive and happy instead of a box of ashes.  he got two more years to live after his surgery, he lived to be 12 years and 5 months, thats pretty old for a big dog like him but even that didnt feel like it was long enough. 
so	away?	so my marriage was not going well and i have been unhappy for a long time.  i got married for the wrong reasons.  after so many mental health issues and anxiety i worked up the courage to ask for the divorce.  sadly when the pandemic started.  it's been a year and we haven't moved forward with it but still on the works. . .  however does the guilt ever go away? my partner still hurts a year after the announcement. . .  they still claim they love me. . .  but i don't feel anything for them.  i care for them and in a way always want nothing but the best. . .  but i see them suffer and feel like i should sacrifice my self for them. . .  so the hurts stop, but that is what i was doing and was miserable and hate my life.  the only ways is forward with my life. . . .  but does the guilt go away?
they were both very surprised	i try and be really optimistic	a few months ago i opened up to my friends about how depressed ive been and how my anxiety has gotten really bad, and  <e1> they were both very surprised </e1>  because  <e2> i try and be really optimistic </e2>  irl (i was gettjng sick of faking it).  we used to text constantly every day and tell eachother everything, but after i opened up to them about my depressuon, they started planning things without me and stopped talking to me unless i started the conversation.  i dont like being alone.  i fucking hate it.  so i try to be the one to try and make plans, but even now they just blow me off and make excuses for why they cant hang out.  its all you can talk to me and im always here if you need anything until i actually need someone.  then you are busy
how	die?	how do you handle being depressed or suicidal but too scared to die?
i	me	i know how and why im depressed im actively aware of it all the time, ive reached out for help but its taking time.  i honestly just accept ill be like this forever and theres nothing that can be done.  im also extremely anxious and will not do things if i really dont want to.  idk what to do and im afraid my overwhelming sadness will get the better of me
i	life.	i am gonna be a failure.  i have gone miles for people who won't even go a meter for me.  i am probably gonna end up jobless and a burden on my family.   i smile and laugh everyday but deep down i just want to die.  i am in constant pain everyday.  i don't even know what's gonna happen in my life.  i am so done with everything and everyone.  i want eternal peace in my life. 
so	:)	so my depressed bf (25m) is finally ready to get help.  he wants change in his life and he's realizing he doesn't want to feel the way he does right now the rest of his life.  (which i'm so happy that he is wanting help now).  tomorrow he will go and see a family doctor just to get a check up and then will hopefully see a psychiatrist after to look into medication.  i understand that not all medication is a one size fits all and generally takes time to see positive results.  i am worried that during this time, he will push me away again. . .  but i also want to stay positive and hope that he will let me stay by his side and go through this with him. for anyone who has an so that has taken medication or is the one on medication, do you have any advice how i can best support my so during this, while he starts taking medication?thank you! :)
the	?	the title says it all : what mark of affection made you feel ??good/better?? ? i am asking because i suffered from depression for 6 years and no one seemed to care.  i kind of got my way out of it and sometimes i feel waves of depression coming back.  lately, i have been dealing with a sick/depressed bf.  he broke up with me to protect me from everything happening and weve been talking and flirting on and off. i have shown support and love since day 1 and i still do.  i just sat down with myself this morning wondering ??wow. . .  i hope he still feels supported . . .  i wish someone did that for me when i was depressed??.  that dude supported and still supports me as best as he can. . .  sometimes.  but besides him, i have never felt like someone had my back you know ? especially during depression. so yeah. . .  i know everyone is different but what kind of things (a word, a gesture etc) made you feel the most supported, understood, loved while battling with depression?take care of you guys ? and thanks for reading ?
i do nothing all day.  college is online, tried working and it was boring	its making me so depressed just being home all day	i graduated in 2019 and my life hasnt been the same since.  everyday used to be interesting and fun.  now i just lie in bed all day, i dont have any friends anymore, i gained about 50 lbs,  <e1> i do nothing all day.  college is online, tried working and it was boring </e1> .  is it supposed to be this boring?  <e2> its making me so depressed just being home all day </e2> .  if i could go back to high school right now i would. 
so	better.	so normally i feel this way after talking to this person i know.  i want to make people happy but every time i out in the effort, nothing comes out of it.  plus i miss the feeling of being loved by someone in a relationship.  all these things tie into why i dont feel happy but its not like i cant do things throughout the day.  its hard to explain the feeling but i just want a way to explain myself so i could feel better. 
and	thoughts.	and i'm still crying.  i have things i need to get done today, but being in emotional distress is getting in the way and it's making me so frustrated. i've been in therapy for nearly three years and i'm taking remeron, which has been doing well for me up until now.  but today of all days, for whatever reason, i'm burdened by fears of being alone and widely disliked.  the worst part is that i know my friends and family love me and would do anything for me.  but my mind works like a fun house mirror and distorts every positive to a negative. my brother physically, emotionally, and verbally abused me every day until i was 16.  i never deserved it and i'm such a kind person.  i'm not even angry with him anymore, i'm just upset that i can't even be happy when i'm alone with my thoughts. 
i just get so depressed	she looks over at me with one eye closed	my cat is being a real pain about putting in eye ointment and  <e1> i just get so depressed </e1>  every time  <e2> she looks over at me with one eye closed </e2> .  i hope it is getting better.  i can't lose you. . . 
my parents are divorced	i basically helped raise him	title says it all.  op is 23 and my younger brother is moving away for uni.  i have lived with my brother since he was born.  i do not have a lot of friends and dont go out because of covid.  everyday i would come home, he would be there.  whether i was sad, happy, etc.  he was there.  i could open up and be honest with him and not be judged or he tells anyone.   <e1> my parents are divorced </e1> , so  <e2> i basically helped raise him </e2> .  he helps cook, and is honestly my best friend.  now he is moving and i totally understand.  he needs to go to college, and i am so proud and happy of him.  however, i still sometimes cry and get really anxious because of the thought of how empty my house and life will be.  he was the only person i actually enjoy talking to and the only person i interact with and socialize in real life (excluding work associates). 
i	coping.	i dont know if this will make sense.  but does anyone reach a level of depression where everything is funny, in a morbid way? i make jokes to my friends and family about death and funny things that i would like written on my gravestone.  i sometimes hate life so much its humorous.  i guess its some sort of way of coping. 
i	list.	i really hate being so worn out from work i have absolutely have no desire do anything at all.  even on my days off i can't find any energy.  all i want to do is lay down and sleep. i never get any productive done.   at best i might go to the store ad buy supplies and that is it.  sometimes i manage to make a list, but i don't do anything on the list.
