21621,noncause,"update:sorry in advance, im on mobile and this is long.  i really wasnt expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people.  thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards!id like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic.  my friend and i made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars.  the coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot.  i went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving.  i stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time.  i played it safe and went by the rules. next id like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop.  it really did take a lot of effort and i appreciate the reminder that it took strength i didnt know i had. i also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend.  she is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started.  i wasnt angry at her because i understand that shes struggling too.  i was just really sad and disappointed because ive only seen her once since last year.  it was more of a bummer than anything and i just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so i came to reddit.  kind people of reddit, you did not disappoint!im going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me.  knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldnt get out of.  it would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but i havent dwelled on it too much.  shell reach out when shes ready to.  if not, then i understand that too. ive been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease & desist letter and went no contact with my mother.  as a result of that i havent heard from my dad since it happened.  i also live states away from my childhood friends and whats left of the family that supports me (not many people).  im better off being out of that toxic environment but its still a grief process losing people that are still alive.  i have also been grieving what could have been if i only had healthy and supportive parents. im also struggling with my marriage.  im a military spouse and its hard being so far away from the little support i have states away (my sisters).  i wont go into detail here about my rocky marriage but its been traumatic and hard.  i havent gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving.  im in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. i also had surgery at the end of october to repair a hernia.  it wasnt too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because i was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds.  that meant i couldnt hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. it just wouldve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend i have here about everything going on.  it honestly wouldve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too.

21624,noncause,"i have severe anxiety.  taking meds, but theyve kind of stopped working like they used to.  got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and i mentioned if i were to be in a place where i could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, i dont know what i would do with myself.  anyway, i dont get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations.  never have the money. ) i check my bank account and realize that all of the bills i had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative.  by quite a bit.  i panicked.  my wife had been looking forward to a small trip to chattanooga to just relax for months.  the kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days.  when i realized i messed up the timing on our bills, i spiraled.  i absolutely lost control and cried.  lost it.  it was probably the worst i have ever felt.  i was crying for about 10 minutes when i suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me.  suicide.  easy.  i got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed.  i told my wife i was going out for a little while.  she knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house.  she physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine.  it brought me out of my head.  i dont know if its something that i would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok i had ever been with the idea of suicide.  we still dont have the money for the trip, but thats ok.  i know i have someone looking out for me. sorry for the rambling, but i figured i just needed to get it out of my head.

21627,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","ever since my first suicidal thoughts when i was like 14 (22 now) people say aren't you so thankful you're still here?no.  the answer is always no.  i've never once thought i'm glad i didn't do it.  i've only ever regretted not doing it.  if i had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after i'd have been so much better off.  not a thing has happened i should've cared about missing. my life has only gotten so so much worse.  now i wish i felt how i did when i first felt suicidal.  that was roses compared to this shit and i actively wanted to die then too.  my life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and i really only would've missed out on suffering. i've only been  <e1> alive </e1>  because 1.  <e2>  suicide is way harder than people think </e2>  and 2.  i'm supposed to and guess what?i'm not thankful for it.  jesus christ do i wish i had just killed myself 8 years ago or any time since.  i've never once been thankful for not killing myself"
21628,noncause,"idk what it is, but like i want someone to ask me how i'm doing, maybe let me at least vent for a while.  i want to be honest and tell people how much i hate myself, feel like a failure, etc you know how it is. but at the same time, i don't want any pity.  i don't want someone feeling sorry for me and offering empty encouragement because they don't like hearing what's really going on in my head. i want help, but at the same time i want everyone to shut up and let me be myself. "
21629,noncause,"i hate that phrase, and i mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesnt actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better for trying to helpas someone who is depressed suicide isnt an option on the table for me yet,  but when it comes to it the only thing im gonna hear or read if someone says that to me is that its a solutionedit:  sorry.   the phrase is suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemdoesnt change anything i just said though. "
21630,noncause,"yup, no shit.  every time i would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say.  the crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that i've been struggling in for years.  i know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time.  it leaves me with the impression that if i sever ties with everyone to the point where i am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe i'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others.  at least that was my impression before i realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions.  so even if i get lucky, and my suicide was clean, it will never be painless.  so, for now i'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after. edit: i sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.   that makes this statement much, much worse.  the people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day.  that sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and i'm sorry you have to deal with that.  to people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, i hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group.  and i hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out. "
21631,noncause,"i actually felt suicidal today.  really and truly. i havent told anyone i know and dont think i will. ive found that being vulnerable with some of the people who im supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me. and the ones i do trust, well i dont want to feel like a burden on them. but, it helped so much.  honestly. maybe its kind of fake cuz its their job and theyre trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt so good to have someone to listen and care. to give a fucking shit that i am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life. i cried so so much.  i hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone. she comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen. she said shell call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

"
21642,noncause,"i have struggled with this for a while.  i would get really down and wonder why i even bother being considerate of others when its not very common for others to do the same for me.  it hurts me deeply when i ask for help and the answer is a quick no.  when , if the roles were reversed, id be tripping over myself to help.  anyone else also feel this way?"

"
21657,noncause,"its ironic.  youre often told that there is someone at your full support for anything.  its initially surreal and youre glad to have that person who you trust wholeheartedly.  who gets you, who understands you. but slowly, it becomes redundant.  theyre gradually becoming bored of you, tired of you and in need of a change.  youre confused and thrown into a deeper hole which you cant escape. the sad truth of the matter is, nobody wants to be surrounded by that energy.  their natural response is to get out, get away.  if you were to be living your best life, they will be there. so what do you do? unable to escape this situation and unable to maintain connection.  opening up is a lie youre told to do with the hopes that youll receive sympathy.  but no, itll just be an extra layer of inconvenience.  youre fighting battles alone and nobody around you is even a little bit pretentious. theyre not like you.  you can support, be an ear to and help them for days, but its not reciprocated.

21721,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","i will be in a constant state of suicidal depression and every once in a while i will enter this new state of feeling like i'm  <e1> getting my shit together </e1>  and i'm  <e2> gonna be happy </e2> .  but as soon as i find my balance, one tiny thing goes wrong and you realize your brain has been storing up all these tiny little secret traumas to shoot into you all at once at the right moment.  life is just one nightmare playing over every day lol id 100% be dead by now if i didn't have people who'd be bummed out"
21722,noncause,"hi!as a sufferer of depression, i know how tricky it can be.  sometimes it comes in waves, sometimes it's just hanging above your head everywhere you go, like a black cloud.  some days you wake up feeling kinda hopeful just to barely make it home alive in the afternoon, begging for every car to hit you, begging for your train to derail so you can get the fuck out of it all.  some days i'm like that.  but now i have a moment of clarity and i wanna share it with you. you are worthy of life.  your life is not a waste.  you always have something to be grateful for.  a roof above your head, a handful of people that care about you, a lovely pet, some good books, good music, great movies. . .  maybe your hair is awesome all the time.  believe me, you're amazing in a few ways.  turning our lives from a curse into a gift is always within our reach.  just use your calm and clean moments to create reminders of this mindset.  post-it notes, reminders on your phone, a tattoo, whatever it takes.  you can do it.  if you need help, reach out for it.  it's not weakness.  it's actually quite the opposite.  you're strong as hell for admitting that you have a problem, that you wanna change it and that you need some help with that.  believe me, it'll be better. don't give in to false ideals, like happiness and over-romanticized love.  happiness is not a constant state.  true happiness is being content with who you are.  stop looking for 'the one'.  there's no such thing.  there are only potentially good partners you can form something beautiful and worthwhile with, if you're both willing to work on it and be emotionally aware.  stop trying so hard to be perfect.  you won't be.  none of us is.  but we're all unique and we can always strive to be better.  do it for you.  let the fuel be self-love.  the world is full of wonder. you've pushed through another day and for some people that's extremely hard.  the people around you might not understand what you're going through.  but i do and i'm proud of you!stay strong! :)"
21723,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","you know how sometimes you literally can't control your thoughts and it spirals out of control and all of a sudden you're thinking about how that one time when you  <e1> messed up </e1>  makes you want to  <e2> crash you car into a tree </e2>  in the hopes it'll kill you?well i've sort found a good way of coping with that.  it is very simple.  just say out loud to yourself: i don't want to be thinking about this right now.  let's think about something else.  at this point in my recovery i'm able to just think it in my head when i detect some toxic thoughts and move on.  but starting out it was quite hard.  i would say this sentence in different variations depending on where i was and what i was doing.  when i was driving i would say hey, let's not think about this in a car.  or i would district myself with a i wonder what's on the radio.  what stations are good? i hope 105. 3 the shark isn't just playing commercials right now.  or maybe i should listen to pop music.  if i was walking down town it would be i should go to the library or i wonder that store sign is still up even though it's been closed for years now.  basically say out loud to yourself anything that isn't what you are currently thinking that is neutral in emotion.  you don't want to go straight from toxic depression to toxic positivity.  take a neutral stance on your state of mind and surroundings and comment on that.  overtime it can become a good habit that can stop panic attacks before they happen. "
21724,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","i am proud of myself that i graduated college.  i made it till the end without actually killing myself.   <e1> it was tough, but i am glad i did it </e1> .  so  <e2> i want you to know that you can make it till the end too </e2> .  please don't give up.  i know it's tough but you're stronger than whatever is thrown at you. "
21725,noncause,"i always feel like no one takes time to appreciate how difficult it is for us to do all the things we are doing.  we woke up yesterday.  we might have gone out to get groceries.  we might have talked to an acquaintance at work.  we might have washed the dishes.  maybe we took our dog for a walk.  it sometimes sucks to think that these 'simple' things that are negligible to most are humongous obstacles to us, but i want to take the time to say that i know it's hard and i couldn't be more proud of where you are right now.  even if it's in the worst moment of your life, it's been such a long and hard journey to get here.  i cannot express my pride for us all and i can't wait for what we can accomplish once this is all over.

21726,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","i'm 14m, i really like videogames and i got my first pc this xmas.  i don't have any friends that i can speak with regularly and play videogames with.  again i just  <e1> feel embarrassed </e1>  for  <e2> posting this </e2>  but i feel really lonely lately and want to socialize"
21727,noncause,"it happens almost every day.  im so upset and with no hope whatsoever.  i cant do anything but lie in bed and think about how terrible and depressed i am.  im a lost cause at this point.  im worthless.  there is literally nothing i can do.  its been too long like this, suffering every day in silence and thinking about suicide all the time.  i am tired of this life.  i have no energy to do anything whatsoever. "
21728,"cause-effect((e2,e1))",i just got a new kitten last night and he's the sweetest thing but i'm having so much anxiety and depression today regardless.  i just want to curl into a ball and cry.  i feel overwhelmed and i didn't sleep well.  i love him so much though.  he's an angel.  but i  <e1> feel guilty </e1>  for  <e2> feeling like shit when something so great is happening </e2> . 
21729,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","depression is difficult enough on its own, but with the  <e1> ongoing coronavirus scare </e1> ,  <e2> human interaction is getting far more limited by the day </e2> .  even my psychiatrist is only doing appointments online for the next 8 weeks.  being stuck at home with nowhere to go and nobody to see is the perfect recipe for suicidal ideation. how can those already suffering stay hopeful when so many resources are very limited? what can stop someone from wanting to kill themselves when the world is in crisis mode itself?"
21730,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","i'm so fucking done.  i want to just die already.  i have autism and i  can't hold a fucking job.  i can't support myself.  17 jobs in 5 years.   average stay at a job is 60 days.  social security insists i am not  eligible to get help, but i can't hold down a job.  i feel like the world  is telling me i am not welcome on this earth.  i am tired of being a  pariah, a freak of nature.  i didn't fucking choose to be born this  way.   <e1> i am tired of being poor and destitute </e1>  because  <e2> i happened to be  born with a disability </e2> .  i am tired of people constantly telling me it  will get better.  it doesn't.  the only way out of this torment i can see  left is to end it all. "
21731,noncause,"ive been depressed for 8 years now, and long story short its really been getting the best of me these past 3 months.  i dont know why its all crashing down now.  im tired of feeling like this, i say i want to die but in reality i just want to escape.  i finally want to be better.  i just dont know how.  therapy doesnt seem to help, and im willing to try anything to feel better.  every time i get to a good place mentally, something happens and im back to square one.  im a mess i guess and just need help to get beyond this"
21732,noncause,"hey guys.  so the last 3 months ive been pretty depressed and i really have no reason to be.  i could have anything i ever wanted, but i picked up a new habit which is riding horses and every morning i have to be out there at 7 which i get isnt bad.  this horse used to bring me joy, but now im only getting 4 hours of sleep per night, could that be making me more depressed. "
21733,noncause,"hey! i attempted suicide by overdosing on my psychiatry meds.  i took all my antipsychotic medicaytion and my only thought doing that was i was going to die soon and it has been a week and i am out of the hospital but the suicidal thoughts are not going back.  rather, it has been coming back at the force thawt i cant handle it anymore.  i have been self harming from 9th grade and my body is full of scars and stuff.  and my freedom to anything is encapulated now.  it is all gone adn i dont blame my family members too.  i dont know how to do anything anymore.  please help"
21734,noncause,"i'm 22 m, it's christmas day evening i feel fucking miserable i want to sleep and not wake up.  i realize it's pretty depressing for christmas but i feel i had to tell someone. "
21735,noncause,i dont belong here.  im stuck in this shitty school where everyone is a racist asshole and the teachers are scrambling to keep it together.  and i just have to sit and watch.  i wanted that perfect hs experience but my fucking friends threw me in the dirt.  everyday i feel more alone and isolated.  i just want to lie down and cry at the end of each day.  people tell me college will be better but i dont know for sure anymore

21737,noncause,everyday is so miserable.  i'm so horribly self deprecating and hopeless that i'm not okay unless i'm rewatching a funny show that i like.  i've been watching it for three weeks and the world keeps getting worse and making life feel even more pointless and horrible.  what can i do to help myself for the next month before i can meet with someone about finding a new medication and a therapist?
21738,noncause,"i don't know how to get over my low self esteem.  i don't know if medication is the answer, drugs or what.  i'm starting to get to the point where i want to feel numb or apathetic.  it's better than feeling shitty all the time.  it's just that i messed up my entire life.  i did poorly in college.  made 0 friends.  could only get crappy low paying jobs ever since.  i feel like my husband probably secretly thinks i'm a stupid loser and probably wishes he had the courage to find someone better (but he's too nice).  i rarely enjoy any hobbies anymore or anything at all.  i have 0 talent so what's the point.  nobody respects me at all. "
21739,noncause,it has been 20 months and 9 days since i had a mental breakdown and my life has gone downhill from there.  i was over working myself when i had the breakdown but now i am unemployed; struggling to motivate my to do my bed in the morning. i am down to my last pennies and i need to get a job.  do you guys have any advice for a depressed person looking for work and how to explain gaps in unemployment.  i would appreciate if you could share inspiring stories of people who went through the same ordeal. 
21740,noncause,"i just can't take it anymore! i feel like shit again.  i'm scared to be alone again.  i want to break this vicious circle but it keeps spinning around me! please somebody help me! i feel that my heart is about to get torn apart.  i have no friends to trust either internet or real life, not a single fucking person want to help me.  i am lost and i don't know what to do! please somebody help"

21742,"cause-effect((e2,e1))",everyone in class says things like oh thats depressing i'm so depressed i'm going to kill myself ect and its annoying they think its a joke and  <e1> one girl cut her finger with sicssors </e1>  because  <e2> she saw it on tic tok and that is dumb do you know ppl who do/say dumb things like that </e2> 
21743,noncause,basicaly the situation is like this:me: ahh seems for a day at least my brain gave me some breath from everything and i can have a decent daymy brain 1 millisecond later: hey how about i stun you and make you think about things that makes you feel guitly depressed and in anxhietyme: i hate this brainye this is my situation now plus i want to listen to my sad playlist but i don't feel to listen to it at the same time. . .

21747,noncause,"hi all, i was diagnosed with depression when i was 13 and ive been in and out of therapy for four years.  i dont know why but every single night my mind is always racing, sometimes i have really obsessive and intrusive thoughts which keep me up.  the thoughts only recently started to become more intrusive and disturbing, and i just get so frustrated when i cant make my brain shut up.  all i want is to fall asleep before 3am at least without the help of sleeping medication, it didnt used to be this hard.  has anyone else struggled with this or something similar to this? if yes, what did you do to cope? (note: im under 21 so id prefer ways to fall asleep that dont involve weed or booze)"
21748,noncause,when i do im still miserable only difference is im not continuously going over the reasons why im terrible at my head i still wanna kill myself when i take them but theres a better chance that i will if i dont.  why am i alive
21749,noncause,i dont feel like i want help with my depression and the thought of being a happy person kinda scares me.  i feel like i want to to get worse and kill myself.  idk does anyone else feel like this?

The amount of panic attacks I would get during school and at home.  I fell into a deep spiral of shit at that month.  It was Hell.  But then later on, I stop doing that.  I sat down and realized maybe I should relax and not look up those things.  It is tempting but I dont.  I still struggle mentally.  Im Bipolar, so thats more of a struggle.  At least, im on suffering thinking I have a brain tumor.  I kept that rational thought of If I were to ACTUALLY have it, there is nothing I can do to prevent or change it.

21879,noncause,"One of the biggest helps in overcoming my HA was recognizing that signs don't exist as to indicate any health outcome.  Just because I see more PSAs and the like about a certain disease does not mean I am infected with said disease.  Look up the Baader Meinhof Phenomenon and you'll see that noticing things more as you have them on the brain is a normal part of human perception. And I'm sure we can all think of an example or something of a situation with a sign that didn't turn out like we thought the sign indicated it would.  For example, just the other week I saw a rainbow on my way to work.  Thought this meant that I would have a good day, but my co-workers were all in poor moods and that made me pissed off for the rest of my Wednesday. Anything can be a sign if you look hard enough.  I know that take a step back and put things into perspective is cliched, unhelpful advice for some, but I hope it can help with realizing what is and isn't a priority concern. "

But how the fuck do I tell my anxiety that this vaccine is not going to kill me, and to stop looking at Fake news on FB and possibly false VARES reports? Is anybody else having health anxiety over the vaccine too?"

It’s been so long that it’s what I’m used to; it’s my default to be on a low simmer of anxiety when i’m doing anything.  My calm would be a non-anxious persons near panic attack, which isn’t pleasant, but it’s what I know. Recently I got my medications switched up, and I think they’re working better than they ever have in my life.  I say this because for the first time, I feel a weird state of neutral calm/content that I have never felt.  But since I’m never calm, every time I think about how calm I am, it freaks me out.  It’s a completely foreign feeling to me to the point where I fixate on it so much, it makes me feel anxious.  My body doesn’t want to be relaxed ever! I don’t know if it’s just an adjustment period of my new normal, but I don’t know.  It’s disconcerting.  I’m not sure is anyone else has ever experienced this, if so, how did it end up?"

I’m always just so worried that someone is mad at me, talking bad about me or thinks I’m a terrible or stupid person.  It’s incredibly crazy making and has really dwindled my self-esteem.  I currently take Zoloft, but I’m not sure it’s helping. In the past I’d go do something active to get my mind off of whatever it was I’d be obsessing over, but it hasn’t helped lately.

So. . . in light of the fact that I (A) still have job duties, (B) have a separate thesis I want to get published by October, and (C) don't have much time to begin with, what do you suppise might be a good game plan? (talking about it's easier than doing it. . . )I'm thinking: spend 2 weeks prioritizing reading.  Conflicts with my want to read up on a certain topic more (which I. . . wasn't doing to begin with!).  Spend 2 weeks working on analyses.  Spend 2 weeks writing it up.  Last 2 weeks on editing, reading to fill in certain blanks.  That's it.  Sound doable?What are things I can do to make those two week intervals more productive?

I don't lack confidence and have no problem joining in with people if there's an aim, some direct reason to be there, but anything spontaneous feels irregular.

You criticize how educators and other responsible adults treat autistic children. You bring up examples of abuse you experienced as a result of your disability status.

Due to this I recently broke down emotionally at work and my female coworker was kind enough to listen to me, but at that time I couldn't fully explain into detail what really bothered me. In the meanwhile I have also talked to my doctor about my suspicion that I may be on the spectrum and suggested that I should maybe tell my female coworker so that my situation at work could also be a bit better.  Right now I feel a bit alone at work. Is it a good idea to tell about this to my coworker even tough I'm not sure yet that I am on the spectrum? I don't have any friends with who I can talk.  And it will also take a month before I could start with my consultations in a specialized center. "

Is this something that NTs understand better? I can't even kill a spider in my house.  I'm not saying NTs are more likely to kill or anything, but I just feel that to get to that point of conflict with a different group over a difference, you're probably more involved in caring about interpersonal relationships.

He enthusiastically said yes and when I got home I snap chatted him to let him know I got home and he again told me how he wants to hang again.  We tried to make plans one day and then he never opened my last snap.  Anyways now he is ghosting me and hiding his Instagram stories from me and I’m really confused and lost.  I unfollowed him on Instagram but he still follows me and even viewed a part of my story then didn’t see the rest but like why is he hiding his stories from me and not responding??

When I said I wanted to go home, I meant I wanted to go back to the days when I was happier, when life was simpler as a kid, when a simple teddy bear could calm the woes in me, when everything was easier to bear.

But I know he is the type of person who gets extremely upset when someone disappoints him or is unreliable towards him.  So I understand why this event would make him feel that way towards me. I guess we really cannot change people.  It just makes me feel really sad that one incident could warrant such feelings towards me. On the bright side, my mom and my younger sister are supportive of me even if they don't understand.  So I'm okay and I can forgive my brother for how he feels towards me.

I want everyone around me to be happy but it’s impossible for me to not fuck up or split or anything.  I just want everyone to like me and love me.  But somehow I always end up alone.

Well he keeps going behind my back to talk to these girls and will delete the messages but promises nothing wrong was said.  We had a fight about it and he cut himself in front of me.  Now with my bpd i get very jealous and controlling.  Should i fix this and try to trust him or leave? Im just so confused.  Any advice?

Like maybe the BPD distorted things so the events wouldn’t break me but then  <e1> I wonder if im just having paranoid delusions because im always alone </e1>  so  <e2> im just constantly over thinking </e2> .  Things are making more and more sense but at the same time I feel even more confused and now I can’t even trust myself. 
22211,noncause,"Idk it the title makes sense but let me explain.  I suffer from anorexia (or i suffered a greater deal years ago but anyway) and i abuse drugs frequently.  When i split on somebody or they do me wrong in my perspective, and when they know i have an ed and abuse drugs, i make it so apparent to them - i stop eating, i start using more in front of them and around them, just so they can see the pain they’ve caused me and in a way make them feel guilty for treating me that way.

My BF is coming over tomorrow and I don’t know how to deal with her giving me the deets.  If I was in a better place I’d be all over this chat.  But right now I’m so meh.  And I don’t want to dampen how she’s feeling because I’m so glad she’s met someone nice after she’s been involved with shit heads.  Anyone relate?"
22220,noncause,"Idk why it took so long to dawn on me but i always thought antidepressants were supposed to marginally help but would never be able to get close to completely getting rid of depression.  but then I heard from some people that their meds made them feel not depressed and I was like. . . . WHAT? That's possible? I've gone through courses and combinations of most ssris available and some snris before I quit taking meds and noticed no actual change when I quit, whereas people have told me that they dont feel depressed when they take antidepressants and they feel an actual difference when they aren't able to take them. not to be a dick but it makes me feel bitter in a way that nothing works for me but some people can feel better just by popping a zoloft every day. (sidenote: at this point I have no plans on going back to a psychiatrist for reasons I don't feel the need to share, please respect this and dont try and pressure me into going back)"
22221,noncause,"What has helped you heal the most? My biggest problem is relationships.  As in my whole self and happiness is based around other people.  I've been in therapy for 10+ years, read countless books and articles and watched so many YouTube videos.  Some things help but I just can't love certain parts of myself or stop looking for someone to love them for me.  I want to.  I just haven't been able to.  I'm hoping this BPD diagnosis and the resources associated with that knowledge will finally help me find something that works for me. ?"
22222,noncause,"Hi everyone, I have severe BPD and I was wondering what medications work for you.  I am on a heavy dosage of Lamictal and Effexor.  They have helped (been on since January) however I still feel awful.  I spiral frequently and I am in so much pain when I do.  I’m still very depressed and my emotions have not calmed down (yes I use just about every coping skill I’ve learned).  They do help overall, but I just don’t think I should still be suffering as much as I do. So I wanted to see if anyone has found a good medical chemistry that works for them.  I thought maybe I just wasn’t being tough enough, but I truly am still suffering.  I shouldn’t feel this terrible when I am taking hundreds of milligrams of medications a day.  Or is this my new normal? They are working and I need to put in more work on my side.  I don’t know, any advice would be super helpful. "
22223,noncause,I am so exhausted trying to find some sort of passion or sense of purpose.  I feel like a waste of space and I keep getting a sick feeling in my stomach that something is terribly wrong.  I can't sleep. I just want to be productive and motivated but I can't make it last long enough to figure myself out.  I don't even feel like myself.  I don't feel like anyone.  It's so hard to put into words.  One minute I'm fine the next my gut is telling me everyone is mad at me and I am worthless and should be ashamed for embarrassing myself just by existing. Anyone with BPD have some pinnacle turn-around moment where you felt something? Something magical? Genuine joy? When did your life finally change for the better? What did it take?! I feel so lost?
22224,noncause,"After a year of speculation, I finally found a good therapist and got the official BPD diagnosis on Friday.  And I immediately felt so much lighter.  There was an explanation for so much that had left me wondering.  And then I found BPD subreddits today, and, after one meme, I knew I'd found my people. I know it probably sounds weird, but I'm happy to know I have BPD, because I can finally see why I think the way I do.  And I'm hopeful I can finally figure out who I am as authentically as possible, outside of my BPD.  So I just wanted to say hello.  Because knowing I'm not alone in this, that there are people who understand. . . it's empowering.  And makes me feel so much less alone. Lots of love to all of you! Stay strong! We'll figure out how to thrive, together.  ?"

I've tried to tell them I just don't want to talk to people because I'm morbidly depressed with so much going on but it's pretty much impossible to ghost someone with BPD it seems!

That yearning to belong and love unconditionally underpins every relationship decision and action I took from my earliest memories to now.

I have that I’m not interested in relationships on my social media profiles, but it’s not entirely true.  It’s just that the only relationship I’m interested in would be with her. The reason she isn’t interested in me is because she doesn’t want to be in a relationship due to things that have happened in her past.  So safe to say she will never feel the same about me and I’m just kind of stuck with these feelings. I guess I’m not really upset about it.  I don’t blame her or anything.  I’m just not sure what to do right now.  How do I cope with these feelings when I get sad about them? Usually I’m cool but sometimes it really gets to me when I feel lonely. "

I don’t get that from my neurotypical friends I have (which are very very few).

I'm posting because I need advice but my question isn't suitable for my family to see and its of a sexual nature.  My boyfriend and I are swingers.  We are active in the kink community and we're well known.  We have a party to go to this coming Friday and I'm feeling anxious about it.  I want to go because we've been doing it for many years but I'm thinking to myself what if this is an attempt to feel wanted? Is it wrong to use other people to make myself feel this way? Are my adult activities a product of my mental health? If I get treatment will I stop enjoying these things? I supposed what I'm asking is should I stop going to these types of parties because they could be detrimental to my recovery?

Peace of mind is one of the greatest struggles we have when suffering from BPD.  I have lived with pain most of my life.  Anxiety, fear, Sadness, depression, rage and low self esteem. What I've learnt since i was diagnosed ;Emotions come firstThoughts follow the current emotionNegative self talk followsEmotions are amplifiedNegative thoughts are validatedCycle is repeated. Now, Once im feeling emotional i stop and i remember the First cycle.  No 1.  And cycle 2.  I then check my thoughts and look deeper at other possibilties that are not just ALL bad. By being conscience of Cycle 1 and swapping it with Cycle 2, You are now using your rational mind.  This can eliviate Cycles 3, 4, 5 & 6. With using this technique, we are now thinking with NOT the emotional mind,  but the rational mind.  You would be surprised how easily you can turn a negative emotion into feeling peace and calm. "

I get really jealous when I see things like this.  I don't understand why I can't do them myself.  Ive tried, something always holds me back.  I'm absolutely terrified of dying alone.  I don't know what to do. "
22236,noncause,"Have you guys heard that phrase? Trying to explain something unexplainable.  That's what it feels like when you try to tell someone how BPD feels. It's a vicious cycle.  I've recently been talking to some neurotypicals that don't understand BPD.  One in particular, who thinks my opinions are problematic, says she appreciates me trying to help her understand what it really feels like to be in pain every day.  Some people just can't comprehend how someone could be so sensitive and cold at the same time.  Do you think I understand it?It's Turtles All The Way Down. Trying to explain the unexplainable.  Like talking to someone from another world. "

She then started listing all the mistakes I had made in the past year.  I did make some sucky mistakes, but I was working to fix things and I thought we were over it.  Some of the accusations were just unfair though. Re-reading the messages made me cry.  I'm devastated again. Did anyone of you experience something like this? I don't know what's right anymore.

There are moments I fell apart but it took a lot to get me there. Somehow now, weeks after breaking up, just the act of seeing him unexpectedly turned into a severe panic attack.  I feared for my life, screamed, cried and couldn’t handle driving myself home.  It was as though I had just endured a 8 hour meltdown from him. A few days before, at a tantra event, people were screaming for release.  The man next to me’s deep bellow sounded like my ex when he would freak out and flashes of my ex ran through my head as once again, a panic attack followed. I don’t understand how I endured so much and seemingly had my shit together but now the slightest thing is setting me off.  Has anyone else experienced that? We only dated a year and a half, surely that’s not long enough to get PTSD?"

But I would be irritated. Looking back now. . im thinking.  dude, if someone close to me just passed away and eventhough you're not mad, you would still be irritated?! SMH right about now.

But also in the back of my head there is the reality of it.  That this is likely temporary.  I’m setting myself up to get hurt. You guys are so strong for remaining NC and resisting hoovers.  I guess this is just some visibility for those of us who aren’t.  If part of healing is backsliding then I guess I’m right on track. Big sigh. "
22245,noncause,Ugh I did it again I looked at her social media . . . Anyways. . .  I wanted to leave a bunch of ??? emojis on her most recent post which was about pride month - she posted saying that last year she was in her first queer relationship (that was me) and how even though it didn’t work out she is grateful for the experience that proved her love could transcend the physical genders or what not.  Then her new non queer bf she replaced me with commented on it saying how much he loves how open she is.  God I fucking am so angry.  I feel like I was used as a prop.

Labile as an electric eel, but as needy as a lamprey, she either repelled or attracted other fish in her aquatically dysregulated biosphere of perceptual mayhem.  I'm sure there were other types of swings and swinging involved, but I never completed an amorous affiliation audit.  Her self-states would vacillate between pathos-infused convalescence and contumacious chutzpah---transforming from the helpless orphan in a Charles Dickens novel to a Marvel comic book avenger was her preferred mode of conduction polarity.  Being a neophyte of Cluster B disambiguation during that time, I wasn't sure who I was supposed to interact with.  Was I the hand-holding protector of the innocent waif, or was I the witness of a BPD rebel without a pause? In the end, she sought revenge for the war inside her head by taking it out on my willingness to understand her.  For her, love is war, and war is hell.

Another obvious red flag I ignored (she started talking about this 1 month into the relationship). Anyway literally 5 mins after that conversation about the other guy, she leads me to the bedroom, lays down and begs me to fuck her. Maybe it was a coincidence.

They've completely moved on and i'm sure I don't even cross their mind.  They probably don't even remember being with me.

I know the emptiness she feels  and the intensity of her emotions are eating her away and I feel helpless to save her.   I reach and reach for her, and hoping beyond all hope that one day she come back to me, but she slips further away.   Now that our marriage is reaching its end, she seems like a completely different person, a monster fully formed. I thought I could do this on my own, but  I can't.

It's strange but as big as he was, he looked small to me.  Like he couldn't even hurt me if he wanted to.  Anyway, he stood down and I left, then told my boss about what happened and that I won't be going back.  The panic began after the incident and is still happening right now.  But I hate bullies.

Asking about my mom didn’t bother me but watching your jaw drop did. The weirdest thing is that I often feel the compulsion to share my traumas when I’m doing poorly but I’m too afraid to over share people into shock.

Often they put snacks on the table in front of all of us and started to eat it, and when me and my brother would reach for some they would start yelling like Who said that you could have some?!How about asking before you just take something?!"
22504,noncause,"Maybe an older brother?Actually, I am the oldest sibling.  I always have to be strong and usually I ended up being the one to take care of others. Even my mom and dad sometimes. Sometimes I feel like it’d be nice to have an older sibling.  Someone responsible and grounded that I could turn to for comfort and advice. I find that as time goes on more, I don’t want to burden my younger siblings with my feelings and struggles. They are struggling so much in their own right now, and I just want them to be okay and find their way. Who do I turn to?My current partner isn’t someone I can be open with either and my parents. . . well let’s just say they have always been self-absorbed in their issues. I know it sounds like I’m complaining but, I’m just tired.  And feeling lonely.

The lasting traumatic effects cannot be boiled down to oh she had it really bad so that's why she's really messed up. According to the invalidating people in my life, I didn't have it that bad so I should be able to take care of myself now and get over it. "
22506,noncause,"Mother's day is hard on a lot of us, myself included.  Recently my therapist has been talking about rewriting my story to frame me as the main character/hero to take power away from my abusers in my memories.  So, on this day, here's to us!

I still feel guilty and as if a piece was cut off of me, but it was the right decision.  And then when my grandmother tells me to call her it just cuts and she is too old to get the whole concept of what my mother did to me. . .  my second question would be, how do you cope with the constant overstimulation? I am on fluoxetine, lamictal and abilify and still need a lot of weed to feel like I am kind of normal. . .  also I kind of feel like while smoking my brain chemicals work better, does anyone know more about this?

So I decided not to this year and not visit for mother's day. The guilt is eating me alive and at the same time there's a lot of anger at being expected to celebrate mother's day.  Now my dad texts me and my brothers just to be sure you're not coming as a surprise, we're not home tomorrow.  We're going away for the weekend and I wonder if it's a passive aggressive way of saying your mother is upset about none of you visiting this year.  I know it's her own goddamn fault but she doesn't understand that, so I know she thinks she's a victim and it still pains me to think about how hurt she probably feels.

I don't think anybody can understand how much people with trauma invalidate themselves.  Last night I was relaxing, and suddenly couldn't breathe.  I had a very stressful week, but instead of thinking that, I made myself even more anxious by thinking what if i'm sick, why can't I breathe?I gasped for air, blew my nose multiple times, went outside to get fresh air, and after an hour went by and I realized I could obviously breathe or else i'd be dead,  <e1> it finally hit me that it was just a panic attack </e1>  because  <e2> I had a tough week </e2>  .

You are smothered and fretted over constantly, never left alone by your own needy parents.

But I didn’t feel any progress.  Tried a new therapist today, and I’m starting to become doubtful that talk therapy works for me anymore.  I feel like I know all the tricks in the book (I had actually read ALL of the many books the therapist recommended today), and I have talked so many times about my traumas that I feel it’s hard to feel them - even though I know I’m not done processing them. I also feel like the therapists I have met lately are kind of hidden behind all their methods and well practiced empathy (and sometimes no-empathy as my last t showed. . ).  I actually feel more validated and seen by my acupuncturist who listens genuinely and treats me without any theatrics. Maybe I have met the wrong people, but I’m still wondering if I should try something new.  Or maybe stop searching and stick with acupuncture and my books?

My mother would say something like this: How could you waist all of those resources and ask so many people to help you to go to this doctor if it was nothing, this is just useless, you should have known better. It's bizzare! It's like I somehow forgot to check by time-traveling.  It always made me so angry.  And it works too.  When my health concern turns out to be nothing I don't feel relif, I feel guilty.

Furthermore, my doctor said that motivation has nothing to do with ADHD, it is purely an inability to pay attention, and that ADHD medication will not increase your motivation.  So, ultimately, what's the truth? Does ADHD medication improve motivation? If so, I believe I would greatly benefit from this.  I don't need it for inattention, but I certainly would need it for motivation.  However, how can I get a prescription if my doctor says otherwise?

There were times I'd use pornography for 12 hours straight, just viewing, opening up new tabs (what an invention, right?)---being unable to close them, and flitterring between each one back and forth back and forth.  It was like an electric shock.  The orgasm wasn't even the best part--and it signified the end of a fiending session. I'd watch certain videos over and over, skipping around here or there, looking for key positions and sounds and words and phrases--re-engineering everything.  Sometimes I'd just go to filter by ewest to just see what was up next on the tubes--looking for more and more to consume and almost memorize.  It wasn't fully conscious. . . it was a compulsion.

Side effects are still there, though not nearly as strong as they were initially.

One of my friends had me try one of his adderall to see if it helped, it did.   Being a very nice friend of mine he has consistently given me a few pills a week to stay focused on my school work.   This has been going on for 3 years now and I've realized how much adderall truly helps me out.   I am not looking to obtain a prescription to abuse the drug by any means, but with the buzz around college students abusing it, Dr's are hesitant to prescribe.   How should I approach my doctor with this matter?  Should I bring up my past use of adderall or completely leave it out?

I took an IR before class yesterday, and with 1 hour remaining I had the worst brain fog,  Meanwhile, XR was great: a steady helper for 6 hours each day.

It was awful.  We had a really good time afterwards but that's besides the point.  I HAD AN ANXIETY ATTACK WHEN I WASNT ANXIOUS.  that's just wrong.  This is not the first time it's happened and the only thing I've been able to do is take some tums before going into a situation where I thought I might get anxious.  I forgot to tonight.

I learned a piano part while the meds were in effect, and I could play it fine, but I can't play it evenly when the meds wear off.  I just thought it was rather interesting.   I seem to recall a study proving that ADHD children have a harder time keeping a steady beat.

I finally understand why it is I can't seem to do what average people seem to do, and how that stems from a difference in how the executive functions of my brain work.   The thing I was wondering is if average people have the full range of attention we do.  I mean if you have regular executive functions, can you choose to lift your perceptive filter? Or in the other direction of the issue do regular people understand what we mean when we talk about hyperfocus?  Now that I finally start to understand myself I'm curious how other people seem to experience the world and thought you guys might have some insight. "

A man named Zuckerman began doing research on those with personality types that get bored fast.  He called them high sensation personalities.  It seems as though these types seek higher levels of stimulation not because of getting bored faster, that's just a result, but because the brain of them processes information much faster leading to the craving for high stimulation.  It has also been theorized that those with adhd also have this quality.  So my question is, is this why we are given stimulants, to satisfy the brains need for higher sensations so that we can allow ourselves to focus on a single task?

I can't remember the last time I've gone this long without smoking and I feel great I've already begun to look at the world in such a different optimistic way.   <e1> I hope that I can inspire some people to quit </e1>  because  <e2> if this 7 year smoker can quit I believe anyone can </e2>  and I my final thought for those who may be interested in quitting or just quit take it day by day it does get easier and it will get better and your future self will thank you.  Thanks reddit for all the love on my last post I hope this inspired some of you today.

The specifics don't really matter except that these behaviors are relatively harmless to anyone but myself.  They provide short term relief from my anxiety, but they shame me.  And  <e1> keeping things from others </e1>  makes me  <e2> feel separate and less-than </e2> .  So, I end up in a vicious cycle.  I'm on the bottom of the cycle today and feeling crummy about it.  But I'm going to hold off for today and hopefully that will result in a little confidence tomorrow. If anybody else is struggling like this: hang in there.  I'm with you. "

Too often am I paralyzed in a state of hysteria, gasping for breath and struggling to keep myself stable.  At the worst moments this is all my body can manage. It will break, if not held together I will break.  Come feel my pain and understand. Look into my shattered mind and dare to tell me I'm ok. Live in my head for a day and you will see I have no place to ground my feet, no secure foundation to rest my head. I just keep falling. Come feel the dark with me. "

Throughout the last 3 - 4 months I've noticed a giant hole in my motivation and memory, which is a big concern for me especially after reading other posts about people of similar ages being worried about not having fully developed brains while being a daily smoker. So this is it, I'm stopping to see if my motivation and memory improves, I'll report back with any updates I have.  The best part about me writing this right now is it's almost midnight and I've nearly completed my first day!Good luck to anyone else who's stopped or are thinking about stopping, I think the hardest part is just getting out of the routine, so we'll see.  :)"

A few weeks ago I experimented with totally stopping with Strattera and my erections came back pretty fast so its pretty much a Strattera issue. At this point I pretty much figure that my penis is going to be flaccid as long as I take strattera so long term, you can see why I think that Strattera won't work out even though it provides a great mental health benefit for me with no other huge problems.  I also figure that Bupropion is my only alternative considering stimulants straight up don't work for me (well they work but they also make life suck).  I've tried Bup.  before and  <e1> I remember stopping it </e1>  because  <e2> it made me too agitated </e2> , but I'm considering taking it again now I'm having a problem I never had before.

I stay up every night thinking about how I'm going to manage to ask someone (this is history class btw) if I can be in their group (it's a 4 person group project), and all the horrible outcomes that can occur if I fail.  I imagine asking but to no avail.   <e1> Then I ashamedly admit to the class I have no group when the teacher asks </e1> .

I started Depakote in July last year when diagnosed (bipolar disorder 2).  With every increase there's been issues but at 750mg it seems it's a lot worse than any other.  I get dizzy, almost constantly feel ill, have a few seconds delay in tracking visually at times when I turn my head quickly, feel physically heavy and notice I look bloated a lot.  I'm tired most of the time, not happy, but I'm stable yet just barely.  At times I still find myself having obsessive thoughts and been depressed most of the time than not.  The weight gain doesn't help.  I'm new to the disorder so I need advice.  Are these side effects usual, like the doctor suggests? Do I try to just get used to them? Would I be better off on other med? Any positive advice is appreciated and thank you.  "

I enjoy being with family and people, I enjoy activities and events, I can laugh and smile.  But, when events or activities end, get together's end, or I'm just in a certain situation none of it seems real.  I partly feel like everything around me is just being observed, like my eyes are recording or something.  I know things are real, I know my body is real, but I feel detached from my body too.  Then memories don't seem as real anymore.  They don't seem as vivid.  I don't get the emotion I used to when I would recall a memory.  Like the other day I was outside, and I was looking at a table maybe four feet from me.  I knew it was there, but it seemed like it wasn't at the same time.  Like it was on a tv screen or something for example, but I could very well touch it if I wanted to. It's really hard to describe.  "

I have to use a considerable amount on getting out of bed, doing some form of personal hygiene, getting dressed and eating something.  By the afternoon, I'm a zombie.

Is it because unlike a gracious injury it is something that is hidden in the mind?There has always been a disbelief and disrespect for mental health issues, in the past when you had a mental health issue you were thrown to the dogs.  Lobotomies were common. People make joked all the time about OCD and saying they're depressed or have anxiety, yet they wouldn't joke about some disease like cancer.  Not that I'm against dark humor or anything, but it one why not the other?I think this issue is improving as public awareness of these issues increases, instead of it being a dilemma known only by those who suffer from it and those who treat it.

However, I can't decide if I should continue taking the medication daily while I'm not in classes for the next few weeks.  My doctor didn't specify, and my prescription simply says to take one or two pills daily as needed for concentration.

I can breathe, and the pain is probably only a 5/10 on that smiley face pain scale.  So, it's not unbearable as of yet, but I feel like it could get there if I can't do anything about it.

How many hits it would break down to.  Four, maybe even five if I took small ones. I smelled it.  I looked for hiding places.  I felt terrible.  I saw a glimpse of my former self. I went to the kitchen sink.  I crushed up the nug, and smelled the herb and dammit I missed it.  I tossed it in the sink, turned on the water, and watched it go away.

But for some reason, my doctor failed to indicate on my chart that I'd been increasing my dosage, and so both his office and my pharmacy has me still listed at 100mgs/day.  I wasn't aware of this until, reaching about 5 days left on my current bottle, I called it in and discovered that he'd neglected to re-prescribe my drugs because I wasn't due to need more for another week.  Are you sure you didn't double-dose a few times? Yes"

Everything just felt right for the first time in months.  Around mid July, I started to notice that this high was wearing off a bit.

Talking about your suicidal feelings is okay but announcing to the community you are going to kill yourself is not.   I understand that many borderlines are chronically suicidal, myself included, but I have to say I find it INCREDIBLY distressing coming here and reading at least one or two posts a day where people are basically threatening to commit suicide.    What do other people think?  On the one hand I think people should be allowed to seek help here but on the other I feel it's really hard on the community constantly being held responsible for whether people live or die.

Not even physically necessarily, I'm just impatient all the time.  And sitting or standing in one place for too long is more exhausting to me than being on the go. In the event I am sitting in one place for a prolonged amount of time like at work, I end up fiddling with other things because I'm so antsy. I just wonder what others experiences are.

The problem is not being angry the problem is how we choose to handle our anger.  One way of handling anger is to acknowledge the sensation of anger as an unidentified need and empathise with ourselves in order to reconnect. - The four main components of Nonviolent Communication are: Observations, Feelings, Needs and RequestsThere are four options for receiving negative messages 1) Blame ourselves2) Blame others3) Sense our own feelings and needs.  (Self empathy) 4) Sense others' feelings and needs.  (Empathy)- Expressing step 4 (empathy) followed by step 3 (honesty) is the most likely way to get your needs met. Steps to expressing anger1) Stop.

He has two kids.  The first one turned out ok, like my mom.  Then came I. I get such a strong feeling that I shouldn't have kids.  Even if things go well in life and I find that perfect happy woman, what if my kid becomes like me?NSFW: Every time I jack off, I look at the white stuff and tell myself that it is not going inside any woman. thanks for reading.  think about it.

I am constantly scrutinising my face and my features, taking issue with them, constantly ruminating on my appearance.  I'd been feeling pretty positive about my appearance, not thinking about it all that much for the past few weeks but it's started to prey on my mind again today following a conversation with a friend.  We had sort of touched on the topic of looks etc when my friend said 'let's race each other honestly'.  It wasn't like she said anything bad about me but it made me hyper sensitive about my looks etc and I've been a bit down since then.

Even before the game came out, I'd always keep myself looking down at my phone in public to avoid making eye contact with people, so playing Pokemon seems like a pretty good excuse to just get out around crowds more without having to really look up from my phone - especially all these restaurants and bars taking advantage of the hype and dropping lures, making it totally acceptable to just sit down away from everyone while staring at your phone.

It did leave me wondering however: Is this common? I had always understood that stimulants were a first-line defense, and the non-stimulant medications didn't work as well.

My experience with CPAs in the past has been one filled with condescension and a feeling that they're dealing with a 5 year old, and I'd prefer a different type of interaction, but I'm unsure as to how to find it, other than interview a ton of CPAs, trying to find one that has some kind of understanding of ADHD.

Some of what I experience is when I take my medication I sometimes feel in a hyper focused state that almost makes me feel like a zombie, I am tired, but focused on something or often in my own little world because of it.

My fingers would probably shake and I'd have a ton of trouble focusing on saying things about myself when setting up the profile.   <e1> I'm so scared of putting myself out there </e1> , largely because of  <e2> needing to have pictures of myself </e2> .  I hate looking at pictures of myself unless they are professionally taken AND I was in good shape at the time (note: this has only happened once and those pictures are now too old/inaccurate).  Has anyone else experienced anything remotely similar? The typical advice for online daters doesn't cover anxiety.  Can anyone tell me anything?"

This new app is based on exposure therapy, one of the most effective behavioral techniques for overcoming social anxiety.  Lots of people may have told you to go and face your fears, but that often does not work.  This app helps you create a fear hierarchy - where you ranked your feared situations from least to most scary.  Then, you start at the bottom of the fear hierarchy and make your way up.  Another common mistake is to leave while your body is still in a state of anxiety.  To help you complete the feared activities, this app has an interactive module that guides you through the activity and ensures that you stay there until your anxiety dies down (as it inevitably will).  Let me know what you think and if you have any questions I will be happy to answer them in the comments.  Good luck! "

I need to work from home, on my own schedule, and I can't use the phone.  Finding a job like this is impossible.  The act of searching and applying makes me want to kill myself.  It's so hopeless and difficult and unfair that I get very frustrated to the point of feeling suicidal.  I am a waste, other people support me.  I've never had income.  I have a worthless college degree in English.  I wanted to be a writer, stupid fucking me for thinking I can actually make a living doing that.

So I did the test and he said it was positive that I could have adhd.  However I need to get an evaluation by a psychiatrist before I could get any medication.  Anyways is this a big indicator that I do have adhd and it's not just being energetic, whenever I have stimulants like coffee or I take advil cold and sinus (has pseudoephedrine) I get really tired and it has a calming effect on me like I'm almost sedated by it.  If you have ever seen that episode on family Guy were stewie takes some adhd medication that's what I feel like lol.  I just drank some coffee and I'm feeling very very calm.  So do you guys think this is a really big induction other then me being very inattentive and energetic? "
24797,noncause,"I don't even know if this is anxiety or a deeper psychosis, but I do get terribly anxious about my performance at work.  I never think I'm doing a good enough job, even when my supervisors are directly telling me otherwise.  I think that it's all an elaborate ruse that they're playing on me (which obviously makes no sense), or that they just haven't caught on to the fact that I suck. I've retrained my brain away from a lot of anxious thoughts that I've had, but I haven't been able to shake this one.  Anyone here go through something similar?"

I used to hurt myself when I was younger, hoping that something would happened to me.  That I wouldn't be able to recover somehow.  As I grew up, I started to fight the thoughts of self-harm.  The thoughts that told me I should just quit and end it.  I was always a lonely person.  I even managed to get myself something or a girlfriend by age 26! And then, she screwed me over.  Absolutely tore out my heart and gleefully laughed at it it seems.  It's the worst feeling I've ever had.  It's been a while and when I think I'm getting better, I break down again.  I broke down at work and cried in front of customers, which is never actually fun.  The Thoughts are back and stronger than ever.  I hurt myself physically for the first time in years the other day.  I'm afraid it's only going to get worse.  I keep wondering why I'm trying.  I'm afraid the thoughts are winning, and I won't be able to fight them this time.  "

I would end it altogether if I could but there are people who would be devastated if I did.  Yes
24801,noncause,"I've noticed that especially when it comes to (romantic) relationships, I tend to overthink everything and it stops me from being able to focus on anything else.  The usual advice (focus on the positive/don't get hung up on things you can't influence/distract yourself) doesn't seem to work.  I overanalyse any contact (or lack thereof) and construct endless scenarios and get really nervous for no reason.  Anyone else struggle with this? Maybe not with relationships but other things like work or school? What do you do to get out of your own head and back into the real world?Some context: I'm ADHD-C, diagnosed and medicated.

But I know there is light, there is purpose.  I have to remember this. This is for myself, but also for anyone who thinks it won't get better.  It will, it just might not be the 'better' that you want.  But maybe we can pursue to grasp these moments and cherish them as if they were the only gift we were ever given. I feel for you all.  I will continue to come and post and to support those who need help.  To share this moment of clarity in a world of consistent confusion and pain is I believe necessary.

I finished the semester with a 2. 0 GPA which i know isn't great at all but i was really proud with that as the last two years weren't so great for school.   I had talked to my dad on the phone about my grades and how i improved them, I was super proud and happy, only to be knocked down again with him saying your grades are still terrible.

It was a *very* hard final, and the test has a huge impact.  Realistically I think I did okay, but I keep thinking about all the mistakes I already *know* I made and how many other mistakes I'll get marked off for that I haven't thought of yet.  Too many of those and I fail.  And failing is a very real possibility as this class has a 20% fail rate.  I have a mid/low B and the minimum passing grade is a C.  This test can easily drag me down past that.  Several of us stayed and chatted with our professor after the test and she thought we were overreacting and said that she was only worried about a couple people, but still. . . "

I've been reading about how long it takes to work, side effects etc, but I thought this would be a good place to share my experiences as I begin my journey into. . .  well, a semblance of normality, I presume. I've experienced some mild effects - to be honest it feels a bit like  coming up very gently on a pill (E), the odd tingle, slightly spacey, that sort of thing. I have also noticed I feel calmer than usual, less locked into the constant battle that day to day life can be, and more aware of the world around me rather than being deep in my own world (when not being irritated and distracted out of it by things going on around me.  Ah, the paradoxes of my life).  What I am trying to say is that the racing thoughts seem modulated to a mild degree already.

Throughout my entire academic career up until this past year, I've made mostly A's and a couple of B's (not trying to look like I'm bragging, I just have to set up for my situation. )When I began middle school, I started to see problems that the typical ADHD student has become more prevalent: terrible procrastination, daydreaming/absent-mindedness, trouble with focusing in class, forgetfulness, trouble completing tasks that I have no interest in doing, etc.  For the longest time, I thought it was just my personality, and I knew that I would have to learn to manage myself if I wanted to do well.

One day it was like my chest was a ball of foil being anchoring by steel chain hanging from my sternum and dragging me down and almost through the floor.  This feeling lasting for hours. Today it's like this immense sadness/emptiness dominating by core (my physical chest) and sucking in all function towards it.  Like a cold dense lump.  My ribs are being pulled in towards it and I can feel the strain through the spine of my upperback as they're sinking in.  I've had to take my medication twice to deal with it.

Even just a busy day at the grocery store will set me off.  I also can't function in a small-ish group of people who are all talking.  If I'm in a group of 4-8 people and there's more than one conversation going on, I shut down completely.  It's like I get super confused and don't know how to function anymore.  Touch is also a big thing with me.  I hate touching or especially scratching paper, and I won't touch anything if I just got out of the shower and my fingers and toes are wrinkly.  I hate soft towels, velvet, velour, and I'm not a big fan of soft fleece. . I guess they're too soft? I don't even understand myself, lol.  "

I've only been on it 4 days.  My heart isn't pounding, but every beat is super pronounced, if that makes sense.  It makes it hard to sleep, just having a constant thump in my chest.  It is so obnoxious.  Even playing video games I find myself holding my breath just so I can concentrate and not feel my heart beating for a few moments. Wellbutrin feels a little different though.  Besides the heart beating, I also just feel kind of weak, and have an uneasy feeling in my stomach and chest.  Finding a good medication seems like such an impossible task.  Not all of them are effective, and when I find one that is, it always has massive side effects that make it not worth taking.  "

My exposures involve telling myself things I fear coming true until I get bored of them.  My question is, is it safe to say things like I will rape someone.  I will ruin their lives.  I will ruin my own.  I'll hurt them as a result of my actions.  For my exposure if I have rape fantasies? "
25139,noncause,"I feel safe.  I feel understood.  There are people who can relate, and there are people in recovery to talk to.  There is someone to talk to *every day* about how I'm feeling rather than weekly or biweekly with a therapist.  There are groups everyday to learn new skills.  I can't hurt myself (physically) or others (emotionally) in there.  I can't binge drink/eat or frivolously spend money.  It feels **safe**.  Most other people in there are excited and looking forward to getting out, but I like staying there until I feel I have gotten the tools I need (I've been hospitalized twice -- the first time for ten days [4yrs ago] then two days in a temporary unit [3wks ago]).

25141,noncause,I think I'm older than most around here.  And I've fought with depression my entire life.  Unmedicated.  It wasn't until later in life that I made any serious attempts.  It wasn't until a recent hospital stay where I almost died that convinced me that life really isn't for me.  I have to admit almost dying felt so good.  It's hard to describe.  It was the first time I've ever experienced tears of joy and understood the phrase.  But as you can see they didn't let me die.  Which has me believing that if I don't go by my own hand I will suffer horribly through some medical issue until I'm gone.  Having said that ever since I've been out of the hospital I often wake up from shitty dreams of almost dying.  Which leaves me either more depressed or even angry that I'm still alive.  I'm not sure how to even feel about that.  I've never expirienced anger before related to suicide or depression and honestly it's just another emotion that's weighing down on me.

Luckily im living in florida and recovery is everywhere and every AA meeting i go to i never feel ostracized or looked down up for having used drugs.   Theres lots of fellowship and good people ive met in AA  so i took my sponsors advice and do AA instead of NA.   Im find my solution there.   Anyone else prefer AA?  I cant really say i prefer it since Ive never given NA a shot.  Anyways.   I was looking for an outsiders perspective.

I feel like everything is coming apart and I just need to die.  I don't want to leave my kids.  I can't seem to stop these thoughts.  I think I should stop the depression meds. . .  they seem to have made things worse.  Do I just stop taking them? The doctor told me a month ago that I need to work up to a certain dosage, so I am guessing that means I need to wean off them.  But I don't want to kill myself in the meantime.  I heard that withdrawals can cause suicidal thoughts, too.  "

He gave me the love I was lacking at home.  He called me his princess and made me feel special and loved.  He also physically hurt me.  But I still love him.  It disgusts me that anytime the memories pop up- whether it be physical or sexual abuse- the sexual feelings do too.  Anytime I think of him I become aroused.  It's disgusting.  I'm disgusting.

In my mind, the cons vastly outweigh the few pros I can come up with.  I just don't get it.  My therapist said to me last week you're lucky to be alive after everything you've been through and it made me sadder how much this statement just left me utterly bewildered.  I find lucky to be alive completely inconceivable. Been a 1. 5 years of serious bouts of constant suicidal idealation and I've found that not even my friends or family can help me as they really have no idea what depression is like.

I have been playing a mind game with myself everyday for many years, knowing that I should not drink but have been shutting down that voice in my head daily by chugging that first pint.  I have realized I cannot be a normal drinker.  My insanity starts with that first drink.  The electric warmth that starts from the top of my head and consumes the rest of my body.  Then I go on to have at least three or four more, supplementing with shots of whatever alcohol I have straight from the bottle (so f-ing classy, I know).  So, on day two I have muscle cramps in my stomach, a foggy brain and an intense thirst that I am trying to quench with water.

Anyway I relapsed last week, marking my first relapse.  Im not sure what to do at this point.  All day long I have to fight myself to not pick up again.  I was really happy with myself while on suboxone.  I was getting depressed but overall my quality of life was better.

I practice yoga 3 times a week, workout twice a week and get outdoors and hang with animals once a week.  Lots of water and no caffeine.

For me, everything becomes hyper-real but in a VERY slowed down way.  Like. . . everything is intensified, but moving in slow motion and I feel disconnected from everything tangible- everything becomes very muffled.

For me, I started hitting the gym and when I started that was some of the most enjoying time I've ever had.  As a newbie you make LOTS of gains, strength and size, you feel alot better and progress is positive even if you slip up. Fast forward years from then, you start peaking to max strength and size.  As you go on, it's harder to progress.  You might be competing, going to powerlifting meets and stuff.  When I go to the gym now, i'm one of the stronger people, but when someone else comes in and is stronger/bigger, I lose confidence.  When I miss a big lift or PR, I get anxious.  If I miss a meal or slip up, progress goes away very quickly. Hitting the gym for me wasn't always about feeling good and endorphins and stuff.

It's not the kind of thing you miss, so that's not an option. I'm not worried about finding the willpower to pass up drinks on my own, but I know I'll be getting questions about why I'm sipping on a soda and not a beer.  People at work have seen me drinking before (fortunately nothing embarrassing, although that's more pure chance than anything), and I'd rather avoid the conversation that the decision to go sober would entail. So I'm wondering, what's your go-to aside from I don't drink?Edit: I live in NYC"

25646,noncause,"Live has been rough lately.  It has always been rough, but especially lately, when I realized that there is no way to go from here, none at all.  This is it, this is my aweful life, this is as far as it goes.  People at work were envious when I got told I had to take a week of vacation, but I dreaded it.  Sitting alone at home all day for days, it is incredibly painful.  No friends to call, no places to be, nowhere to go from here.  My dad asked me about the things I'd like to do while on vacation.  There are none, just misery and lonelyness and a deep hatred for a life of suffering and pain. The first few days were okay; keeping up with tasks, cleaning the apartment, trying to stay busy.  But in the end there is nothing left but emptyness.  No hope.  And suicide is so appealing.  I thought about it for many years, but it came and went.  Not this time.  It doesn't leave me.  I just can't stop thinking about ending it. "
25647,"cause-effect((e2,e1))", <e1> Do we find it difficult to get through every day life </e1>  because of  <e2> a crippling depression that not many people experience or are our brains shit at dealing with emotions and simple routine tasks </e2> ? Not that the end result would be any different regardless of the answer but I was just curious on your thoughts about this
25648,noncause,"(Some background for context: I'm a huge failure already, I've taken a medical withdrawal from school twice before and I'm a year and a half behind where I should be.  I was supposed to graduate last May. )I honestly don't know if I'm going to make it through this semester before.  I've fallen behind yet again, to the point where no matter what I'll have to take incompletes in multiple classes to finish them after the term ends.  I have dragged down my classes and been a burden on my professors' goodwill all semester -- they've worked to accommodate me, but it's wrong that they have to accommodate such an entitled and broken person in the first place.  My parents and many of my friends don't even know I'm struggling.  I think my friend already see me as a perpetual victim or a charity case"
25649,"cause-effect((e2,e1))",I've had pain down there for pretty much 5 years.  I have never had sex.  I was excited to try out a small dildo (4 inch) but it was so uncomfortable and painful.   <e1> I have tried physical therapy which didn't help </e1>  because  <e2> all she did was stick fingers up there </e2> .  I have tried medication which only numbed down the pain and the OBGYN said better to be numb than in pain which I thought was wrong.  I'm fucking lost and want to die.  I'm broken. 
25650,noncause,"Last night was rough, I hardly got any sleep.  I drifted off briefly only to be awoken by vivid dreams.  The voices were engaged in a nonstop predicative thought bickering.  It's as if they can hear me speaking or hear my sub vocalization and respond to me.  I've considered that maybe it just feels that way due to the nature of the voices.  They quieted down a bit in the afternoon and I got some much needed sleep. Now they are more sporadic"
25651,noncause,"Tonight I stumbled across some very old, very embarrassing GIFs that I made when I was younger that I thought I'd long since deleted.  Looking at them makes me queasy, and the fact that they're floating around out there for anyone to see is mortifying.  I hate myself so much, I'm disgusted by the way I look and the things I've done.  I just want to escape it all for good, the regret I feel is suffocating. That's not all that I found though, as it turns out, some of my old art ended up on some forum or message board where everyone was laughing about how awful it was.  I'll never be good at anything, I'm a failure and I want it to be over, I want to stop hurting. I know these things aren't really that bad, but I guess they're the straw that broke the camel's back, reminding me that I'm terrible and ugly with no talent to speak of.  I don't want to hurt my family but I just can't take it anymore, I'm going to go down a bottle of Benadryl, here's hoping it kills me quick.  "

I took a few different scales and inventories and they all came out as mild to moderate.  My symptoms are not severe enough that I should need to take beta blockers or anything like that, but I was curious to know if there were any reasons that I should go to get officially diagnosed.  Thanks!"
25654,noncause,"Welp today will be day 3 again.  I was clean for 15 days started using here and there again.  Then I put together a string of 12 days of use and I said whoaaa dude this isn't right and went cold turkey.  I count myself blessed.  I only had one bad night (the first night) of RLS.  The 2nd night I slept more then tossing and turning which is surprising.  I am dealing with low energy and the mental cravings which are getting to me, but I'm trying to stay busy.  I force myself to get some exercise when in acute WD which for me was . 5 Mile run.  I know it's not a lot, but I think it helps.   I'm at work now, but getting motivated is tricky.  I'm sure I'll get there.  Here's to putting a longer string of clean days then my attempt before.  Cheers! "

25656,noncause,"I finished one of my final exams, went up to turn it in, and realized I was the last person.  Before I started taking meds, I was never like this.  I was usually in the first 50% of people to be done.  But, recently since I've starting taking medication, most of my tests have gone to the time limit. I think that when I get to a question I would normally attempt, get impatient and then skip/come back to, I now don't even think about moving forward until I have answered the question perfectly (or at least what I believe to be at the time).  This obviously takes up more time, but I think it definitely helps my score as long as there is plenty of time.  **TL;DR** Used to be fast at exams before starting adderall, now I almost always run out the clock.  I'm curious if anyone else has noticed something like this as well?"
25657,noncause,"I just discovered this sub not long ago and I'm really happy there's places like this.  I've been through inpatient rehab 3x now, most recently in February.  I'm lucky, in some ways, that I'm a combat veteran and your tax dollars (thanks BTW) have paid for any and all treatment, including this injectable medication [Vivitrol]( rehabs. com/naltrexone-vivitrol/) which I take monthly.  I was curious if anyone else had tried the medication route and feelings for or against.  I know some 12 steppers who would say that any medication is cheating and recovery is forged through interpersonal relationships and working the steps.  Thanks!"

25660,noncause,Im going all in cold turkey.  Its time for me to enjoy life!!!
25661,noncause,Like the title says I started PET today.  I have been seeing my therapist for about 6 months and do have a good amount of trust in him.  Since starting therapy I have managed to stop cutting.  I did have one suicide attempt during that time but feel I have come a long way.  His guidelines for doing this work is that I had 3 months free from self-harm and suicidal behaviour.  Today I relayed the trauma to him.  It was tough.  I knew it would be tough.  He was compassionate and gentle.  I am finally hopeful that I might be able  to turn a corner and stop the horrible flashbacks and body memories.  
25662,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","Does anyone struggle with using the bathroom and having accidents? This is absolutely embarrassing, but I only feel comfortable going to the bathroom at home and only at certain times or almost in a planned order so when I unexpectedly have to go or I am in the middle of something else, I will try to hold it.   <e1> I also put off bathroom trips as much as possible </e1>  because  <e2> I am in there for an hour sometimes doing rituals </e2> .  I fear the bathroom so much but I obviously can't avoid that one (maybe a good thing since I avoid everything else). .  I occasionally have accidents from holding it for so long and I am always so nervous and anxious, that I will just have to go a little bit and I'll pee some before I can get there. I fear that holding it so often and also straining when I go has caused me incontinence. . I also have a huge hangup with numbers, so if I notice it is a certain time, temp, phone charge, or anything with unsafe numbers"
25663,noncause,"I'm swamped with all the work I've been putting off and I basically cleared my schedule for the past three days to do it, but I've just been fucking laying in bed, thinking about killing myself basically every second I'm not sleeping.  I'm self-destructive to the point that I'm ruining every single thing in my life to the point that I grow more suicidal by the minute, but I'm not self-destructive enough to just end it.  "
25664,noncause,"I'm pretty sure I've had depression since I was 14.  I'm 30 now.  I had a major break down four years ago.  I ended up quitting my job and getting help from a counselor.  I then went to college, got married, had a son.  Now I'm halfway through college and I feel dead inside.  Nothing sounds full filling.  I'm having trouble going to work and school. I've been through counseling but I just feel like I've tried everything and nothing has worked.  I'm not even sure what I hope to accomplish by posting.  I just know I feel stuck. "
25665,noncause,From years 5-21 all you do is go to school to learn how to work for the rest of your life.  Money is nice but in the long run it doesn't matter.  What's the point of working my whole life just to be old and not able to do anything with what I have.  Most people say your twentys and teen years are the best years of your life.  What's the point of going through  the rest then.  I mean shit if that was the best pet of my life then the rest of it is gonna be shit.  I just don't see a point to life.  All you do is work to make someone else happy and in the end you just die and non of it matters.   And don't even say girls.  There's no way in fuck I could get a girl friend let alone a wife I'm too fucked up in to many ways.  
25666,noncause,"So a couple weeks ago I caught a cold, and took NyQuil every night for a few nights.  Generally put me right to sleep around midnight and knocked me out for 8-10 hours.  However once I got over the cold and stopped taking NyQuil I have had nearly an impossible time falling asleep and this problem persisted until about 5 days ago when I developed yet another cold.  So I started taking NyQuil again and like the first time around, knocked me out right away for the full night.  But two nights ago, I felt fine and didn't take it and was up until 8 am unable to sleep.  I took it last night and fell asleep right away.  Today, didn't take any and I don't even feel drowsy (nearly 4 am). So does anyone else seem to have this problem? I know antihistamines are one of the ways people deal with insomnia but I didn't think that it was possible to develop a dependency, and after such a short time too. I've had insomnia issues for a while now and was thinking I was just starting to get over it so this is upsetting for me :("
25667,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","Thought it was the greatest thing.  Made me feel good and would give me something to look forward to after work. . . Now I'm realizing it's not as great as I originally thought.  I had been taking it once every 24 hours  but now the amount I used to take isn't strong enough. . . and when I'm in between doses I feel like I'm going through withdrawals.  I still have about 500 grams left but I think I'm going to throw them all out and completely go through withdrawals this weekend, as I'm off work for 3 days.  I have been using a little less than a tablespoon a day, I know now not measuring it out was another mistake.  Should I be worried about withdrawals?  <e1> I wouldn't think they'd be too intense </e1>  as  <e2> I've just been using for 3 weeks but I just don't know what to expect </e2> . . . "
25668,noncause,"I am a 17 year old guy from Germany, and I can't remember when i havent been depressed in my life.  It has gotten worse over the last few years and I've gone to a psychiatry, have therapie and been on meds.  Nothing has helped.  The one person that meant my life to me, said she wouldnt do anything if I would try to kill my self, and now she ignores me.  I am alone, and I have few to no friends.  Yesterday i tried slitting my wrists but unsuccessfully.  All I have done in my life is try being nice to people, help them, but nobody gave a shit about me.  There is no reason to live anymore.  I was being made fun of by everyone and I cant talk to anybody.   I want to kill my self but, i am also a coward.  I don't know what  to do anymore.  "
25669,noncause,"I have fallen back to cigarettes twice after break ups.  Now I find myself in a break up with the greatest love I have had in my life.  The last time I went through a break up I ended up smoking for over 2. 5 years.  I have been quit for over two months now with 670 unsmoked cigs! It's going pretty well and getting easier.  However, this break up is a real heart breaking event.  I will not go back to smoking.  I know it will not help everything I am going through.  I never want to quit again.  I am done.  But of course cravings are rearing their heads when it was getting easier.  I am just so sad sometimes.  Thanks for letting me share and vent a little.  This sub has given me so much support.  Keep going everyone! Peace.  "
25670,noncause,"THE RELATIONSHIPWe started dating 3 years ago, at that time everything was fine and dandy.  But months went by and she started being more and more aggressive with me, we were fighting over everything, weekly or every two days.  This was the moment I started to change, I thought I could make everything better being more tolerant and patient.  But after a year everything was very much worse, she went daily from you are the best that happened in my life to you are the worst that happened in my life (quoting literally)"
25671,noncause,"Anyone have any ideas how to snap out of it? My depression is lifting slowly and I feel quite motivated and optimistic a fair amount of time, but for several hours a day (usually right in the middle) I seem to slow right the way down.  I'm very fatigued, can't concentrate, feel like I need to sleep and my mental speed is at an all time low.  It does lift, but takes hours and doesn't seem to respond to anything (caffeine does nothing, exercise only wears me out more, meditation sends me to sleep) - it's just a case of struggling through the fog until eventually it lays off a little. Any ideas? I'm going to ask to see a neurologist as I don't actually know if it has anything to do with depression at this point.  "
25672,noncause,Im unemployed atm and in receipt of sickness benefits which gets me by.  I dont think it will last forever though so it is only temporary and will hopefully get my feet on the ground.  I do want to work but feel incapable of getting a good job.  Im not intelligent and lack the social skills that would be enough to get through an interview.  I can see myself working low paying jobs for the rest of my life which scares me.  But what about you guys?

25674,noncause,"I can't think of a single way in which I have improved on myself in the last 5 years.

25675,noncause,"Because I sure as hell am feeling the weight of every single mistake and misstep from this semester.  And it really, really sucks.  I've been loosing sleep, emailing my professors in a panic, and generally not dealing with it very well.  It doesn't help that my husband (and main support) has been in another city all week on a business trip, either.  All my coping mechanisms in the last few years have been built around him being with me or at least more available, and now I'm feeling guilty for not being prepared to stand on my own two feet again.

This would be great - but even now I have uncontrollable muscle tension and I'm shaking just thinking about eating in-front of him for the first time.  This, paired with how it'll be the first meet-up, is especially terrifying.  I've found that I worry about what the other person will think of me if I eat a messy food and spill some or something else equally embarrassing.   <e1> I even struggle to eat with friends because of this </e1> .   <e2> I'm scared that I will shake, sweat and tense up and that my voice will wobble as a result of my anxiousness </e2> . How can I relax before, during and after? Does anyone else experience this? I wish I could put it off but we've already almost gone out lots of times and I don't want to let him down again.  Side note: he knows about my anxiety and I am in therapy, but my therapist couldn't seem to get to the root of the issue either.  "
25677,noncause,"I don't know.  Maybe it's because I have to do an interview that I'm too anxious to do just to get the accommodations.  Maybe it's because my doctor has offered to submit documentation explaining my conditions and the accommodations I need and has even offered to discuss my conditions with you over the phone, but you no longer accept medical documentation, you want to hear from the student and then decide for yourself if the student *really* needs the accommodations they're asking for, because you, somehow, are more qualified than a medical professional when it comes to deciding whether or not my condition is bad enough to need accommodations. Last time I tried to get more accommodations, they told me the one accommodation I had was more than enough and that I wouldn't be approved for any more.  I wanted one accommodation at the time.  My doctor currently wants me to ask for at least four more accommodations.  Lmao. I feel like shit. "

They respond with.  Ugh.  I hate to be touched.  And I don't know why I even bother.  I can't change shit.  I can't help anyone.  I'm so tired.  So exhausted.

I get a bottle of wine, go downstairs, and cry for two hours then go to bed.  My 3 year old son says that he can see a monster named Kookoo following her and trying to eat her.  Omg.

I finally decided enough was enough and just stopped buying smokes.  Haven't looked back since.

The most severe problem I have is execution.  Frequently, I've spent a great deal of my time studying (scribbling into a notebook) and I'm all too much of a stranger to building projects.

I will be posting like mad on here as a quit journal type of thingy.  Peace,Love and Bless you all. "
25922,"cause-effect((e2,e1))",I have had ADHD probably my whole life but wasn't diagnosed until I was about 19.  It wasn't an issue in grade school or high school because I was getting good grades so it went unnoticed I guess.  But honestly  <e1> for my entire life I could never finish anything or work to improve certain things about myself </e1>   because  <e2> I kept getting lazy or quitting </e2>  .  I always hated myself for it.  I absolutely hated myself for all the things I knew I could have done

I have anxiety and she is bipolar, both of us are on meds and do ok most of the time.  She's had a lot of trauma in her life and has dealt with it, but I want to be my most supportive when she reaches out to me during a low point.  She had an abortion in high school and I want to help her deal with her trauma when she reaches out, and I want to help knowing how best to work with her being bipolar, if anything particular helps.

Crazy long trip for two days that I guess I really didn't want to do.  Now I feel horrible. . wasted money.  Extreme self-hatred at the moment.  This is the sort of thing that makes me want to do drugs.  I just can't forgive myself for this.  I hate this feeling so much. 
25928,noncause,"I was reading about how body focussed repetitive behaviours (BFRBs) release dopamine in the brain by offering an easier means of stimulation or more accurately, satisfaction? Does anyone else pick their nose a lot and feel intensely satisfied when picking their nose? What other BFRBs do people experience, apart from the more obvious ones like hair pulling, scab picking, nail biting"
25929,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","I am currently in the process of getting a prescription for SSRIs, which my therapist suggested are a good way to go for me.  However, there is something I forgot to ask her that is kind of concerning to me.  I find that  <e1> I am a very cautious person </e1>   who  <e2> always considers all the risks involved in any action before taking it </e2>  .  In some situations this may be detrimental, but in others I think it inhibits my impulsive urges.  So I am concerned that getting rid of this anxiety could cause me to engage in more impulsive behavior that would get me into trouble.  Is this something that often happens to people when they take SSRIs?"

I love it! He can't get one up on me when I'm sober!!!  "
25931,noncause,I was very skeptical as I went into reading this.  I thought no way a book is going to stop what I've been struggling years with.  Boy am I glad I read it.  I've always known smoking is an addiction but this book really pounds that point home.  I'm now looking forward to every craving and will scream at the top of my lungs DIE MONSTER even if I look insane.  I've never been so excited to be free and it's absolutely stupid how damn easy it is.  I guess people were right when they say a positive outlook changes everything.  I'm so happy
25932,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","I've given sobriety a solid chance.  I've seen people come off drugs and live more fulfilling lives with a sense of peace and joy.  I envy those people.  I wish I could be like them.  My story isn't the same though.  I've gone for long periods of sobriety, socialising, doing therapy, working on myself, eating right - all the things that were suggested to me.  Yet I always end up in the same place, a place of total desolation.   <e1> Drugs (and I include alcohol in this category) </e1>   are the only things that  <e2> give me some relief from the torture of existence </e2>  .  People say to me that it's not good for me, but I've tried to hell and back the alternative and all I've received is a flat and empty existence with raw pain and desperation.  With drugs I can transcend this world and go elsewhere.  I momentarily cease to exist.  I become a child again, carefree, full of wonder.  Of course this doesn't happen all the time, but there's a damn good reason why it's so appealing. "
25933,noncause,"Over the years i've had a variety of mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, ADHD, etc) but I've come to be more confident and carefree when it comes to other people's opinions and it has made me feel better.  But what I still can't shake is the whole you're always depressed you're too much you're not enough. Usually these are from women that I actually have the trust to open up to"
25934,"cause-effect((e1,e2))",So I have my normal splits that at times I can catch myself but not always especially in high stress situations however this is not what I'm posting about.  It seems to me that I split heavily into depression and anxiety and feelings of worthlessness.  Once I make these splits into  <e1> depression and anxiety </e1>   its very hard to come out of and a lot of times results in  <e2> panic attacks </e2>   and I've had some severe ones recently due to toxic environment that I'm vigorously trying to get out of which i feel like cause these splits more often.  Anyways I have recently been diagnosed and have to wait till June 10th for appt for medication.  So all in all is this normal? Is it possible that maybe your mind tends to split more on a certain way than others?

25936,noncause,"We are both academics.  I mentioned how I was proud that I had been able to read a journal article a day so far this week (better than my normal rate of one every few weeks).  She looked puzzled, and mentioned how she used to read several journal articles each day.  I know she didn't mean to undermine me, but it feels kinda crappy.  Maybe some of you can relate. "
25937,noncause,"I've noticed recently that positive reinforcement works much better for me than negative.  I'm much more motivated to work hard when I get immediate positive feedback or rewards than if I'm trying to work harder to avoid negative consequences.  (For me, it's because I fixate on the negative consequences and immediately feel overwhelmed by the task before I get started) I think this is common in people with ADHD, so do any of you have rewards systems you've implemented for yourself? What are your ideas for gamifying life? "
25938,noncause,Does anyone on this sub still smoke weed? Or has anyone here ended up picking it back up shortly after their DP faded and not had it brought back? I'm kind of curious about this 
25939,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","I'm convinced every night I should always  <e1> go to bed feeling like crap </e1>   because  <e2> I'll never be loved correctly </e2>  .  I'll never be loved correctly to heal.  I hate that I know in order to be happy again, I have to learn self-love and *bla blah blah bla bla.  Let's cut the shit, okay? I have googled depression a million times.  MayoClinic and other medical sites say that depression is very common. "

You're absolutely correct! Now -- moving past that -- I've broken it down and really deeply contemplated this.  1.  I just turned 30.  Now as you've heard it all goes downhill for single men at 30.  It does.  My life is also a complete fucking joke and I really have no actual plans outside of winging it anymore.   <e1> I'm a full-blown existentialist at this point in my life </e1>   because well. . .  <e2> life has been a shitfucker to me </e2>  .  2.

I'm really scared.  People like me shouldn't have a gun in the house. "
25942,noncause,So I was just diagnosed and told a few select friends about it.  It was such a huge weight off my shoulders when I was officially diagnosed - suddenly I could explain a lot of things I put down to me just being lazy or forgetful.  So the diagnosis meant a lot to me
25943,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","I don't want a daily planning app, I already use TickTick for that.  I want something more long term but not necessarily goal oriented (like Rewire).

I already use Ever Note but  <e1> I would need to subscribe to premium </e1>   because  <e2> I have a lot of images, articles, pdf files I need to add to it </e2>  .

25944,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","All I want to do is die.  I honestly wish I could get my hands on a gun to blow my brains out.  I've tried OD-ing before but alas that did not work.  I have a sick fantasy about my eating disorder getting so bad that I'm basically a skeleton and end up in hospital.  Do I want attention? Sure.  But  <e1> I don't know how to get attention in a positive way </e1>  , especially since  <e2> I've been majorly depressed for years </e2>  .

I've canceled so many appointments because of this and I feel like such a shitty person for doing it so often.  All I want is to get a good night's sleep and be well rested.   Why is this so damn hard?"
25946,noncause,For reference so you don't have to search: started at highest dose of ab 25g but usually took 15-18.  Started tapering around May 5th at 12g/d am down to 6g/d.  So it seems a fog is lifting.  I'm not out of the woods but it's easier now than it was at 12g.  Idk why.  Maybe bc I've been using my self-discipline muscle.  I still get that well I'll just take one extra dose today go back to tapering tomorrow about 100 times a day but somehow I haven't done that in daysssss.  I just keep asking myself why do you want to take more? How will it make you feel if you do? I realize I don't need it if I take it I'll be upset it'll prolong my progress.  I keep having these thoughts of jumping off.  The last few months I couldn't even fathom it.  If I stick to my schedule
25947,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","I had no idea that my Nmom wasn't the only one of her kind.  I realized about a year ago that  <e1> she had been gaslighting me my whole life </e1>  , which has  <e2> lead to some rather severe anxiety/depression/panic problems in me </e2>  .  When I found this forum, I was shocked.  The traits list in the sidebar may as well be my Nmom's playbook.  The thing is, I was never taught any of this in my rather long education in psychology.  Maybe a paragraph about NPD when I was an undergrad in intro to psychopathology.  I'm a little resentful of that, but I'm wondering what I can do to raise awareness about this problem? What help is available to people in this situation aside from talk therapy and breaking contact?"
25948,noncause,"I have forever my whole life felt like my head is in the clouds, things bore me quick whether I want them to or not.  I cannot focus for long in class and lose the routines (working out, guitar practise) I WANT! I keep having medication mentioned (adderal) but I'm afraid ill lose a big part of my personality which is being that 'creative lost in the clouds guy' by being hyper focused, or if it would amplify my depressive symptoms.  If anyone can give me some of their personal experiences id appreciate it.  thanks"
25949,noncause,"I recently downloaded this daily quote app and it's helped a lot with motivation to stay clean.  Today I saw this quote and it instantly reminded me of weed addiction.  Basically, don't be afraid to give up a good lifestyle smoking weed in order to achieve greatness. "
25950,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","I was just reading a thread that gave me the idea to post this.  I won't go into details of my struggles, you already know how it goes.  But there is one emotion, or lack thereof, that I want to point out: hope.  Hope is so scarce when you are stuck in this rut.  And reading many of the posts on this sub can make it even harder to feel you have any chance to overcome this disorder.  But you can.  With  <e1> the help of a lot of DBT work and family support </e1>    <e2> I have been able to pick up my life over the past five years by coping more effectively, self-soothing when applicable and untimely becoming the person I never thought I could become </e2>  .  I know this is an extremely trite thing to say. . .  but things could be worse.  Having BPD places you so low on the totem-pole in every category of your life that any step towards overcoming this disorder will only take you higher.  It's all up from here. "

But I have a plan laid out in my calendar and have my timer set to countdown 6 hours and have a test tube for my doses (will have to get something else for my second dose).  I plan on cutting down weekly and stop by end of month? Is this doable? How can I make sure it sticks? I hate this shit!!!!! Anyway, I suppose it's up to me.  I wish I was stronger.  "
25952,noncause,"I haven't had any hallucinations in the past couple days. . . which is off-putting to me.  I have noticed a slight increase in my paranoia and depressive mood swings.  I sometimes feel extremely depressed - like the world around me is just too much stimuli for my mind - but those feelings only last a few minutes.  Those thoughts used to last weeks.  But the last time I even had these small yet powerful dips was several weeks ago.  I'm not sure why they're returning.  I've become increasingly aware of the times I stare into space. . . . . that's the only way I can describe it that'd make the most sense in writing at least.  At times I become hyper-aware of a single point within my field of vision.  Everything else just fades away. Today I had the feeling that people walking by me were judging me.  I tried to convince myself that that thought was just a delusion.  But in that state it's hard to convince yourself of anything other than lies.  I felt as if whenever I walked by someone, their eyes were instantly attached to me.  Glued to me.  Thanks for reading. "
25953,noncause,"So, nightmares, hey? Lifelong problem.  Woke up from one graphic and bloody one this morning and then BAM, I remembered something new about my childhood nightmares.

They enjoyed my suffering Sometimes, they nibbled my feet and chewed my legs and enjoyed my suffering.  They loved it.  I begged for my dream to be over.  I begged the monsters to kill me. But they just dragged it out deliberately Savouring my suffering Vile grins Always starting with my feet like that and working their way up and loving the way I squirmed and begged.  Or playing games like wheel of fortune except it was to choose which method of torture to use on me.  Wtf for real tho"
25954,noncause,My friend recently started taking LSD and said she's gonna take these drugs all her life and she's fine dying by 40 as long as she has had a good life with her drugs.  She also says that you can learn so much about yourself when you're on a trip and that you have a great time while taking it with other ppl together.  So she kinda tries to justify it with that.

You try to shut your brain up, then eventually forget about it, get lost in your thoughts, again. Sorry for the extremely depressive post.  This is what i've been feeling for the past 1-2 months and I thought sharing would make it a bit better.  I would be so happy to know if there is anyone feeling the same. Edit: Also, I would like to know what kind of things you do for overcoming this problem. "

Something happened that wasn't really anyone's fault, so I wasn't really angry at anyone in particular, just angry at a situation I found myself in.  In frustration, I threw my drink straight onto the ground, in the middle of the bar, and it scared a bunch of my friends and other patrons.  After throwing the drink, I immediately felt close to zero anger, and regretting what I did. I'm not usually an angry person, and historically, I usually control anger well and my anger does not have violent physical manifestations.  I have certainly never done anything like this before and even my friends say they were surprised and didn't know I had it in me to be that kind of angry.  One guy friend said I'm still the mildest person he knows"

I'm in a place that requires a great deal of effort to get to, and I know most of the people I'm with like me.

Not a single person that knows me had the idea of me killing myself cross their mind, yet every short while i stare at my rifle solemnly.  I don't self harm, and I try to improve myself and help others, but nonetheless the occassional call of the void sneaks into my head.  I've grown tired of spending time with my family, and the only things that distract me are video games and my DIY projects. "

Is it my parents' fault for not guiding me in life and teaching me to deal with my emotions? Is it my peers' fault for not being able to read my mind and treat me how I should be treated? Is it my fault for being weak and sensitive and caring? Is it God's fault for allowing certain things to happen to me? Is it the peoples' who have inflicted physical and emotional pain fault?

Anyone got theirs checked without having to explicitly ask for it?I am going to try appointing a test to find out my values and see if there might be an unbalance.  Anyone else had this done? If not I recommend it and ask for your result values on paper.  I don't trust doctors Your levels are fine"

So I'm trying something different.  I need support.  I need help.  I can't do this on my own, and these stories have really inspired me.  I'm hoping by telling my own story it provides so accountability for my actions now.  I want to give this up, if solely for the purpose of proving my own power to myself.  All I can ask is that you guys are here for me through this journey like I will be for you!!Thanks for reading, Good luck out there today everyone :)"

I noticed the owner was always nasty to me and once even told a waitress to tell me to leave if I'm not gonna order fast enough and another time I came for a coffee and to do my homework and I overhear the owner say to someone  does she think this is a library?. And a few months ago I was standing outside with a friend and noticed the owner looked at me and turned to a waitress to say something about me.  Almost like she's warning her about me.  So I recently found out that nmom told her that I sleep around and that I'm a junkie etc (all not true) and that the owner should hit me if she feels like it.   How'd I find out?

I feel terrible, my legs won't stop moving and I can't sleep more than 2 hours.  Nothing interests me or brings me pleasure.  My brain isn't working, I can barely type this out.  Thoughts of using are consuming me again.  I guess I don't really have a question, just that I'm going to keep going and fighting.

The akathesia that I am experiencing is this feeling that I have to move my legs and arms all the time and this terrible sense of inner restlessness.

I used to be able to manage this shit but I have degenerated.  Outward anger is the only thing that has been making me feel good.  Additionally my day is also filled with emotional catch-22's.  I have to have a catharsis (a breakdown or session of crying which just inevitably creates more humiliation) however in my home that's discouraged, plus I have been informed that if I do have a catharsis my dad and brothers will have to leave our house.  So, I'm kinda fucked.  I know hurting people will make me feel better, but doing that will incite repercussions.  My inhibition towards my sadism humiliates me even more.  Also I fuck omg hate myself and all my sentimentality.  I hate how fucking weak I am, and I hate how I can't dominate people. "

Can't ever fix it.  I try to go to bed early shut off all lights and distractions but i just lay there looking at the ceiling until i eventually pass out (which depending on what my sleep time is at the time could be at least 2 hours) basically going to bed early has no affect.

And the comedown off these drugs isn't even that bad. The only really messed up thing about these drugs is the sleep effect and how you can go temporarily psychotic if you take it too far. Man all they are is uppers that give you a mood boost, energy and a can-do attitude toward any work you need to do. They don't even get you that 'high' in the traditional sense, the headspace is mainly just one of hyper alertness and focus.  And you get so much fucking work done. IDK. Am I kidding myself?I think the dangers of amps are exaggerated like 500% and in reality the only reason they cause so much damage is because they're more prevalent in disadvantaged communities where people feel hopeless and will do too much of any drug.

My boyfriend responded to this by saying that he didn't understand why my father is treating me this way.

Earlier this week, one morning I kept thinking to myself to not forget about bringing my lunch.  A minute later I went to brush my teeth, got ready, and then left the house and had completely forgotten about lunch.

It was expected, as it happened (embarrassingly) back when I watched it in a theatre.  But I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes me so sad about watching it.  Maybe the loneliness, the longing, the insecurities of reaching out to someone who comes from a very different world. Anyone else have this feeling about a movie?"

Always ending with a positive thought.  It's still not easy to shake off negative interpretations of this, but fuck those thoughts man.  I'm proud as hell.  I might try a meditation with my mother or a friend.  Whether or not this *really* helps me, knowing it's another avenue that I'm exploring and improving at for coping is something to be proud of.

26799,noncause,"36f but ive felt sixteen since that birthday.  i never thought i would actually graduate high school, let alone college (it must have been a mistake), have a career (sympathy hire), or build a family ( ive deceived everyone) - it all seemed so far beyond what i was capable or worthy of.  ive struggled with anxiety and depression since i was 13, wrongly diagnosed at 18 (bipolar 2), and started effective treatment for anxiety and depression when i was 21. i married at 25 (clearly someone who just felt sorry for me) and had a kiddo at 30 (who the hell would trust me with a child?!) - things i never thought i would survive to experience. i have absolutely continued to struggle (some moments/days/weeks more than others) but just  celebrated my 36th birthday in the last week - something i never thought would happen.  surely id be dead by now. for the moment im ok and ive surrounded   myself with people who will tell me when im not.  happy birthday to me, and thank you for reading.  ??"

26804,noncause,i have recently stopped taking celexa at 10mg to change to zoloft.  i took zoloft for 3 days and decided i was just gonna stop taking antidepressants all together.  i stopped on march 8th and have been having really bad violent nightmares.  did anyone else experience this as a withdrawal symptom? also feel tired
26805,noncause,"start today.  our lives are rare.  did you know that the odds of being a human is 300 trillion to 1? when we think about that and stop for a second to think, we truly have already accomplished everything we have wanted, even if it isn't physically there.  it all takes time. when we begin to set goals and work hard daily, its interesting how the universe, god, source, the divine, whatever it is you believe in will truly bring us more than what we expect.  keep going and if someone hasn't said this to you lately, i am proud of you.  you're doing the best you can in this very moment with the circumstances we have been given & thats enough. what is it that you want to start focusing on today? start it.  even if you don't know where it will lead you, take one step towards it, keep working hard and keep doing your best with it.  you will be, i will be, we will all be amazed with where it will lead us. start now & know that the noise around you is just apart of the journey and process.  you're exactly where you're meant to be. i love you. drey <3"
26806,noncause,day 2 of decreasing paxil dosage and broke my 5 day strike of no caffeine to help my anxiety.  not sure if its the paxil withdrawal but ive had one of the worst days in a long time im so mentally exhausted.  nothing terrible happened i just cant think straight and the slightest inconvenience breaks me down.  all that happened was that i locked myself out of my truck during my lunch.  also forgot to fill my dogs automatic feeder before i left for work and got home and realized and had a breakdown on my garage floor while my dog ate for the first time today.  i dont know why im typing this i just cant go off on my friends ive never felt so upset and angry i really wish to be in a hospital right now i crave the cold air and everything white around me.  is that crazy ?
26807,noncause,"ya know how after you calm down a bit, you just feel so numb and tired.  i love that feeling.  your to mentally and physically exhausted to care about anything.  you just go to bed and sit there and do nothing.  you almost feel peaceful. and then the stress starts piling up again.  its a viscous cycle.

26808,noncause,"last year i was very suicidal.  i didnt want to do but i felt like there was nothing else i could do.  i was about to call an ambulance or something but i was too anxious to make a phone call lmao. its okay though, my mother came into my room and. . .  kinda helped i guess. she didnt do anything to help actually, she was half asleep.  but i didnt kill myself.  :)"

26810,noncause,this is me on a weekly basis. anyone else? being neurotic and depressed is hell.

"
26814,noncause,"hello everyone,idk why im typing this right now.  maybe i need attention, maybe i just want to relate to yall.  im depressed as fuck.  i stayed home from work yesterday so i wouldnt have to get out of bed and shower.  the cold days are the hardest to get out of bed and go do anything.  i would rather stay home and play league of legends than go to my job, and sometimes. . . .  i do. . . .  its regrettable, its not right but its my illness.  maybe im an addict not ready to quit video games. . . .  maybe im an addict who believes he can actually make something of himself streaming games and wants to pursue that dream.  maybe i hate my job.  whatever it is, who the fuck cares.  the point is, im depressed, we are depressed, but i am alive to day and god damnit i showered.  i made it to work.  i hate that i was late, but fuck it. . .  its progress. for those of you fighting today, keep up the fight.  im right here with you.  and i love you. sincerely, spidermojo.  if you are trying to make my streaming dream come true, just follow me and we can talk about depression today.  its spidermojo on twitch also.  not what this is about at all.  just want to let u know im here with you and for you"
26815,noncause,i know in the past i have tried to use negative self talk and beating myself up about it to motivate me.  this doesnt work and usually just leads to me feeling depressed. i found it helpful when i learnt why. th negative self talk leads up to believe negative things about ourselves.  like that we are lazy or useless.  when we believe this we feel hopeless to change it and so hopeless about getting anything done.  hopelessness leads to depression.  depression is a hibernation state to conserve energy when things are looking hopeless.

26817,noncause,"i just turned 22 today.  and while i'm usually excited and grateful for my birthday, this year is a bit different. the past few days i haven't been too excited about my birthday or looking forward to doing anything special. i've been dealing with depression and anxiety since i my first year in high school.  it was manageable between the years, but i started to notice it getting worse at the start of 2019.  i got more depressed and anxious. i feel 2020 has pushed my mental health over the edge.  my mental health has plummeted. i've been developing an i don't care anymore type of attitude and that applies to my birthday as well as all the things i loved.  i don't get excited or happy about anything anymore, even things that make me happy.  i haven't worked out in 3 years. just thinking that i grew another year in age makes me dread what's to come in the future in terms of my mental health.  i've just been losing hope, meaning and purpose (not contemplating anything suicidal).  i've been kinda losing hope in that my mental health would improve.  everything has lost its meaning to me.

"
26819,noncause,"apart form having no apetite whatsoever, when i feel super anxious it's like my bladder and sphincter loosen up, and i end up making twice the trips to the bathroom that i usually make.  i have asked some friends who also suffer from anxiety but they have just laughed and thought it was just weird.  does anyone else have this experience while being really really anxious?"
26820,noncause,"i've used gigs, parties, even tv premieres.  it's often helped me through bargaining - i'm not going to kill myself until i've done this wonderful thing - and it's a relatively easy thing to do. even if you're broke as hell, it can be something as simple as having a friend from out of town over for the weekend or making a meal for one or many friends. i'm still fighting my depression and still have a lot of bad days where i'm suicidal af, but i'm currently on a little respite break in another city that i've been excited about for a month and it has made me feel so much better (ironically even though the sky is currently full of smoke from the bushfires). godspeed depresso buddies.  may we all get through this apocalypse together. "
26821,noncause,"lately, the thoughts that i have once i wake up are should i kill myself today? or is today's the day that i'm gonna kill myself?so this is a small progress for me and it makes me somehow happy knowing that these negative thoughts are not permanent. "

26823,noncause,"i do but i dont.  im so sensitive, anxious, i try to be a good person to everyone around me, im a cry baby, depressed, and more.  ive also come to realize every time i tell myself i cant do something, i end up overcoming it and doing it.  my brain always feels foggy and idk life doesnt feel real at times.  im just rambling sorry.  yeah though sometimes i have suicidal thoughts, i wouldnt ever do it. . . . but i think about it.  my uncle who lived with me my whole life did it and broke my heart into a million pieces.  at least we think he did.  sometimes i think he was murdered.  how do i overcome my fears that anxiety plants into my head? i just want to be normal!"
26824,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","i did untill i sat down and put all my attention on that area affected by my anxiety and started to slowly consciously guide my breath there. what happened next was so unreal to me at that time. i felt that area, which was hot from anxiety,  <e1> become cold and colder </e1>  as  <e2> the stuck energy was being dispelled </e2>  and after a while it felt as if i swallowed an ice cube which reached the depth of my stomach to that location. to me this says a lot about how important it is to consciously breathe at specific times.  for example did you know that certain diseases thrive in an oxygen less body?the most interesting thing about breathing i learned is that it is one of the many expressions from what many would call prana (chi, life-force, prana, qi, ki, pit, rapture, chills, spiritual chillls, goosebumps, ecstasy, euphoria, aura, mana, ruah, nephesch and many more). i made this youtube video for you if you are interested in these concepts.

26828,noncause,im sad for no reason.  i make things into a big deal for no reason.  i hate crying but i cant seem to stop.  i just want to curl into a ball and dissolve away.  fuck covid.  fuck feelings.  fuck everything man.  ughhhhhhhhhh.  go ahead and scram along if you want.

26909,"cause-effect((e1,e2))",i attemped suicide and it didnt work.   <e1> i talked to the text helpline im not sure if the people are bots on it </e1> .   <e2> im really down </e2>  rn and if i dont get support im gonna attempt again. 
26910,noncause,"you know what? fuck depression.  fuck anxiety.  fuck all those negative feelings.  it's like when i try speaking out about my feelings i feel a noose tightening around my neck, but i won't let it stop me this time.  ill push those feelings back, i cant let them control me this time.  i will be fine.  i am okay.  there isnt a need to panic.  i won't let the devil take control of me anymore.  i am me.  i am not my depression.  i am not my anxiety.  i am young, i have potential, i have family, i have friends, i have a boyfriend.  i can get through this.  and i swear to god i will not let those negative emotions get the best of me and destroy me.  when they push me down i will get back up and scream a big ol fuck you to those emotions.  so, moral of the story is fuck negative feelings. "
26911,noncause,"i made the tremendous mistake of smoking by myself during one of my depressed states and i can say i definitely almost fell of the deep end.  my mind started to race a mile a minute thinking about how much i fucked up, and how much i hated other.  i cried and cried during the puffs.  just when it couldn't get worse i started hearing voices, whispers, people screaming in my head telling me things trying to drag me down. .  holy shit that was a trip. "
26912,noncause,i am the emotional support in my group of friends.  they always text me when they feel depressed and i text them to ask if they are ok every time they havent texted in awhile.  so im sitting in my room waiting for a text just that one question.  i just want someone to genuinely listen and not just to feel obligated to ask me. 
26913,noncause,"what i mean by that is. . . . i have told my boyfriend multiple times that i want to die and that i am hopeless and feel completely empty.  i know he is going to leave me.  he looks at me with cold, disgusted eyes now.  about ten minutes ago, i reminded him that that is how i still feel and told him how goddamn sad i am.  he replied, i think you're just being dramatic. is he right? or is he an asshole? i'm losing my mind right now and need some fucking help"
26914,noncause,"someone came up to me and said hey what are u thinking about you got a serious face on, i realized i dont think at all my brain is completely shut down anyone just not think or is it just me? or maybe im just not creative? idk what id want to be thinking of but i know a lot of people are always constantly over thinking i just dont have that ability may be a good thing im also emotionally numb as well"
26915,noncause,"not gonna make a novel about my life, basically i had a group of friends that i had for a pretty long time and i opened up to them about my suicide attempt and my depression and they pretended like they cared for a bit but a few weeks later they started making jokes out of what i had told them and i feel like it's my fault for opening up in the first place and i feel like the world is just telling me to bottle up all my feelings and that i should be cynical but i don't want that.  now i have a new group of friends that really do care about me and while i still don't feel happy i feel like i have people to talk to about my feelings. "
26916,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","dont worry.  i just decided to give up on getting better. i know its a cliche.  everyones saying that  <e1> if you dont expect anything you wont get disappointed </e1> .  so  <e2> i just dont give it hope anymore </e2> . i wake up and go to bed everyday hopeless, knowing exactly im still trapped in this shithole.  everyday is the same.  im suicidal but i have been like this for so long its becoming like one of my characteristics now.  i dont and i cant do anything to help me feel better and im okay with it?im sorry that my post is a mess.  i guess all im saying is maybe this is normal, maybe nothing is normal.  so just keep going?have a normal day everyone. "
26917,noncause,its past 4 in the morning again and im just staring at my ceiling praying silently in my head to a god who may or may not be there maybe im just crazy.  i think ive cried in the bed for 8 years all throughout high school and even now . . .  i dont know what to do at this point when i cry i dont feel anything i just have tears running down no emotions whatsoever.  constantly replaying regret after regret in my head.  i just want to be happy and i dont know how to be im always feeling so lost. . . . . 
26918,noncause,how can i overcome daily suicidal thoughts that last 1 to 4 hours.  every day i have 1 to 4 hours where i have extreme suicidal thoughts.  but after those 1 to 4 hours i feel fine and can moove on with my day.  but they do come back if i dont go to bed in time.  so my question is what can i do to survive those 1 to 4 hours and not kill myself so i can have some peace after that timeframe. 
26919,"cause-effect((e2,e1))"," <e1> i feel sad </e1>  bc  <e2> it could've been avoided </e2> .  they could've gotten help and lived, it wasn't their time.  but i also feel like i wish i had the courage to actually pull the plug like they did. "

"
26921,noncause,"i don't really talk much about being low or troubled.  it doesn't really feel like anyone would understand.  but people expect me to either tell them or get over it.  now, i see where they come from, i act weird, cold and distant a lot.  they are obviously tired of asking me.  what do i do? is not telling them 'bout it selfish of me? or do i pretend to be alright for their sake?i would tell them but i really don't want all the pity that would follow.  i just want someone to understand. "
26922,noncause,"i have been alone and unloved for as long as i can remember.  my friend started dating a girl he met out of the blue and is so punch-drunk in love that when he came over for board games last night, not a single minute went by when they weren't giggling, touching, or flirting like children.  it has been ages since i have been touched that way intimately. . .  and i just don't know how long my body can physically go without that.  i want to check out of this miserable hotel, i have overstayed my welcome. "
26923,noncause,"im no longer the person i used to be or i dont want to. i dont want to be bubbly anymore. i dont want to talk to anyone and vice versa. i want to become so cllosed off,. im basically feeding my depression, but depressed me is way better than happy me. i dont want to be who i am anymore i want to change for the worst.  well not worst but you get my point?i hate it when people say i should be myself, truth is myself is absolute shitim going to sink een deeper, believe every voice in my head, heck i deserve the pain anyways,i deserve to be depressed, so thats what ill do. "
26924,noncause,"i won't lie and say i've got a ton of relationship experience.  i'm a bipolar shut in who stays inside as much as he can.  i've been in 2 major relationships in my life, both of which cheated on me within the first 3 months.  i just don't really see a point in staying open you know? i just think that i would be better off sticking to my normal ways.  i've got anxiety and depression to top it all of so i guess the best decision would be to give up on relationships until i figure out the rest right? it's just really hard for me to make progress without seeing an endpoint for myself.  i pride myself on being logical so i can't help, but believe that there's just no point to working on myself.  honestly, this wasn't supposed to be a rant, but you know how it goes. "
26925,noncause,ive always been told that the meaning to life is to have someone you love and have children but i dont believe it.  i tried for so long to find someone to love but everyone has turned me down or just faked being a friend.  it really hurts when i think but that meaning.  i dont think i can do this any longer.  it really feels like i dont belong here and should just end it so people dont have to deal with me. 
26926,noncause,. . . but then i open my eyes just to realize that i'm still here.  i'm still stuck with no way out.  no happiness. people tell me it doesn't have to be this way.  how can you be so sure?. . . i just don't understand why i can't just fade away. 
26927,noncause,why do poor people have children and make them be doomed from the start? i'd rather have not been born because life is always on hard mode
26928,noncause,"when i was in highschool i tried to kill myself, obviously it didn't work but i was still hospitalized.  i was asked if i was depressed/suicidal and i just told them i tried to kill myself because i was bored.  afterwards my mother just took me for a shopping trip at the dollar tree and never spoke about it again.  i am so angry about this outcome and blame it for too much of how i'm doing right now, it's hard for me to let go of things and letting go of this specifically is even harder.  it was years ago but i still feel so disrespected and swept under the rug, by my parents, medical professionals, etc.  how do i cope with this???"
26929,noncause,"let me start off by saying this isn't a sad post.  rather, it's one coming from someone whose been revealed to the purposelessness of life and how meaningless it all really is.  there are only a few things that happen if i die tonight.  some folks will be sad tomorrow.  someone's going to have to water my plant.  i will be replaced in all regards by someone i am sure is me 3. 0.  i've gone out of my head and seen the void that is existence.  like god wanted me to see how insignificant i really am.  i could lay here and do nothing, or do anything, it really doesn't fucking matter.  play it out, the next action you take, all the way to the end.  change my mind, tell me there is a reason to move. "
26930,noncause,i cant connect with people anymore.  or maybe people cant connect with me.  i cant help but want to stay in bed i dont really have any reason to leave.  im 25 and have not felt romantic or friendly love since maybe 20/21.  i feel like giving up.  no one understands

"
26932,noncause,"i have no friends, no family, no job, no hobby, no obligations, no motivation, no drive, no desires, no excitement, no wishes, no hopes, no dreams, no wants or wills.  just nothing.  no reason to get out of bed, and i dont want any. what am i suppose to do when i have nothing and want nothing but also have no drive or motivation to change any of it?iv been to therapy, iv done the drugs, iv tried everything im suppose to and yet here i am, still with nothing. its been over a decade now, when will i finally get the courage needed to end it? will i ever? maybe im doomed to live like this until nature does it for me.

"
26934,noncause,"i am bipolar, 20m and have suffered sexual abuse.  i do have something to look forward to, but im not sure i can see the light.  its a matter of how much are you willing to take in the short term? my current state is that i am isolated at home no friends in my immediate area, neglectful and casually abusive parents and my abusive brother.  he was the one who sexually abused me.  my parents dismiss my mental health and i feel detached from a girl i love so much.  i honestly dont know how much more i can take.  im currently thinking about suicide.  i dont know how much ill be missed, but people get over death.  it just happens.  im not worthy of love or mourning if im a burden to everyone and the world.  im not meant for this world. "
26935,noncause,"when you feel something other than regret, hurt, loneliness, self-contempt.  days like today where i just feel something thats good for once, like every once in a long while, i dont mind being stuck in this body.  its a liberating feeling that comes and goes like wind, makes me feel happy even just for today, i know ill feel awful again tomorrow.  but at least for today, i felt great, with no one elses help. "
26936,noncause,"today a friend texted me to ask if i'm okay.  she said i seemed a little off for the past weeks and it was true.  i said yeah just worried about my grades bcuz my midterms were pretty messed up so betting everything on my finals now.  then i typied a whole paragraph explaining that there are other things too, like being away from home for too long (international student studying in the u. s. , haven't been able to go home since sept.  2019), loneliness, sensitive personality, gaining weight, financial issues, etc.  then i deleted the paragraph bcuz who gives me the right to bother others w/ my unhappiness.  i'm now scared to see or hear someone says: let me know if there's anything i can do.  seriously, i can't thank you enough my friend, but there's litterally nothing you can do and i'm sorry that i make you worry. "
26937,noncause,"i was diagnosed with clinical depression in my teens (my family doesnt know i went to a private clinic for help). since then things just keep going downhill.  but whenever the suicidal thoughts come in i just need a wave of anger to push it all away.  just anger at everyone who ever doubted me, offended me, anger at my miserable rotten luck, and anger to prove them wrong just one more time, to just keep going one more step to prove everything wrong. i dunno if anyone else feels the same way.  perhaps this anger is a symptom of my depression but its the only thing keeping me going at times, and i am strangely thankful for it.  does this sound weird?"
26938,noncause,well today i finally got the balls and took some days off for my mental health.  kinda excited considering these past few months have been rough for me. hopefully this can be a start for change in my life.  gonna try out some the things i used to really enjoy and used to live for:)
26939,noncause,"it's weird, i constantly think of killing myself and i hate everything, but i'm okay.  i feel like i'm faking depression.  i can't explain it properly, but it's basically this i'm at rock bottom, but it's fine since i have a house there. usually it's just nothing at all and that's okay, but sometimes i also feel like i'm bottling everything up, because the bottle gets very close from opening.  most of the time i don't even know if the bottle is real, but whenever i get a minor inconvenience i am much more sad then i should be. idk if this even makes sense but i feel like if i can, usually, live normally and be okay, those times were i can't must be my fault, like somehow i am letting it happen when i shloudn't be.  rationally i know i'm not choosing to go down the depression hole, but i can't stop thinking that if i tried hard enough i could stop and just be okay like every other day.

26941,"cause-effect((e2,e1))", <e1> im sad </e1>  when  <e2> i look at this sub and see how many others feel the same way as me </e2>  its terribleno words
26942,noncause,i feel like ive developed worse depression since last year.   it was bad last year but its on a different level now.  i feel. . .  literally like a few major lights went out inside.  i feel impending doom frequently and unnecessarily.  ive almost given myself heart attacks from anxiety.  i constantly feel like something very bad is about to happen.  im drained of energy and life.  i sleep 8 hours a night but that honestly doesnt help much.  my ability to feel joy has been significantly reduced.  i mean significantly.  im almost emotionally numb at this point and even paralyzed at certain times.  the thing is good things have recently happened but for some reason i dont respond to them the same way i wouldve used to.  i just used to have such a spark.  i had so much energy and a lot of people told me i was a light in their life.  not the last few years. 
26943,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","i've been depressed for i'd say around 6 years now.  and i'm starting to get really worried about the brain fog.  it's been getting so much worse the past few months.  i think that  <e1> it's been getting worse </e1>  due to  <e2> the stress of me coming out to my family as lesbian a couple months ago </e2>  and them not accepting me at all.  i've been very forgetful and learning anything is just extremely difficult.  so i guess i was just wondering, is this a normal thing that happens and will it ever go away?"
26944,noncause,how do you handle being depressed or suicidal but too scared to die?
26945,noncause,"i don't want to keep trying to live the same miserable life, and there's not even a point anymore.  never has been.  if i go to sleep and don't wake up it'd be ok with me at this point, that way no one can be disappointed that i took my own life.  i'm sorry.  have a good time"
26946,noncause,"tears flow down your cheeks behind closed doors where you hide from those who do not cry.  you are afraid of no one else shedding tears as often as you.  outside closed doors no one cries, outside closed doors everyone is afraid of tears.  you do not cry in front of anyone else.  everyone thinks you are like them, they do not cry and neither do you, but behind closed doors everyone cries. we all cry where no one sees"
26947,noncause,"i feel empty inside.  i have friends , get girls although nothing meaningful, get above average grades, my family is upper middle class and cares about me.  i just dont feel anything anymore.  i can have fun, joke around and so on, but when i eventually end up by my self in the evenings i feel empty.  thought about ending it, but dont want to put a burden on my family by dying. "
26948,noncause,"m16 here.  i genuinely believe that im just a lazy piece of shit that fakes depression to get some excuses and attention.  im going to a mental hospital in a few weeks so i guess according to my therapist i am mentally ill.  i feel so empty and useless all the time and hate everything about every day but i still feel like ive just faked my way into it, as if im just making this all up, making myself feel bad on purpose.  its to a point where my mind doesnt allow me to feel any joy because. .  well idk. i also dont have any benefits from acting like that, my grades dropped from fairly straight as to ds.  but probably im just making up that im making this all up. sry for bad english im german/russian"
26949,noncause,"i am so tired, depressed and lonely.  i dont even have one single person irl i can talk to.  have abusive family.  zero friends.  this is such a miserable existence. "
26950,noncause,"for the context, i'm an adult in mid 20 that fails being an grown up.  are there people out who's just like me a weirdo? my family doesn't care about the fact that i am slouching my life away.  bad decisions in life to not take action or responsible had led me to being a useless good for nothing person.  i don't know anyone could help except myself, just really embarrassed of myself. i wasn't good at anything like literally even passing, and it's that bad.  the only strength i have is being kind.  i can't help but feels hopeless about my future. "
26951,noncause,"if a person has a physical illness it is completely fine but apparently if you have a mental one you're not trying hard enough.  can you tell a person with a walking disability to try to walk better? no.  it would be considered irrational and rude.  how can you tell a person who's dealing with depression to try harder to be better, to do things, to be more social.  i dont even want to try to do anything.  im just so sick of it.  you should be trying harder be more positive others have it worse.  same goes for anxiety.  like i'll be in the middle of an anxiety attack and they'll be like just calm down, go socialise.  try harder.  like, there's literally 0 logic.  so sick of this treatment. "
26952,noncause,its got to a point that even writing down how i feel is just no.  anyone relate?
26953,noncause,i've always had this fantasy that maybe i can create something that helps people.  i don't mind sinking my time and even sacrificing my life if it means i can significantly help just one person. but i feel like games that heavily features the topic of depression are self-indulgent and don't actually help people in the bouts of it.  i guess i could code an app but i'm not sure what it would be?i'm not here to get app ideas.  i just wonder what can be done for all the depressed people.  i wish i could be of use.  in what form would you like to see help? ever thought about that?if you can't think of anything that you need then that's okay.  perhaps this thread gave you pause to reflect on your needs.  maybe that's something that you've neglected.  maybe you could break it into manageable pieces and try to pursue it at your own pace?
26954,noncause,"for me it's mostly my vision of a better tomorrow.  i daydream a lot about getting to a certain point in life.  getting out of my longtime depression, optimizing my life in the best possible way, possibly even finding a proper girlfriend.  i'm really looking forward to the vr technology evolving, for example.  other than that, currently i'd say i enjoy music, porn (lol) and drugs the most.  three things that help me the most getting through life at this moment.  oh, and internet of course.  it's an amazing distraction overall. how about you guys?"
26955,noncause,"i'm in the darkest place i think i've ever been you can see from the scars on my face i'm not where i'm supposed to be all alone why have you forsaken me? all alone you make it hard to believe i'm in the darkest place and i don't just mean this jail in my mind there's a darkest space trapped in an even darker cell you got to see it to believe it's true that's why it's so hard to believe in you stay real, but you got to have faith but i wondered where you were when i needed you when that girl was telling lies in the court with her hand on the bible, where was the lightning? the great vengeance, furious anger that samuel.  l. j.  made sound so frightening"
26956,noncause,"about 4 months ago i hit a walli left my brand new friend group straight up.  i told them i was having a depressive episode and ghosted. they tried to reach out but i couldn't.  i'm afraid i caused more drama by dipping or than if i'd just shared with them what was going on. in the last month i've reached out to 3 of them. i'm also one of the oldest of the group so i feel like i should've had my shit together.  but, i didn't.  so here we are. i feel okay now, but i also feel like i've burned the best, strongest bridges i've built in a long time.  which is threatening to send me spiraling again. i'm so fucking tired of getting in my own way"
26957,noncause,"you are a disappointment and will never amount to anything. i should have bought a porsche instead of having you. my dad drank when i was a kid and put me through hell, now you get to deal with it, because you deserve it. sorry your friend died, maybe if you hadn't been grounded you could of been there for him. you're girl left you? maybe if you weren't such a fucking bitch she'd have stuck around, no one wants to take a pussy of a man. i had to quit school and start working because you were born, and you're the reason i'm not successful. maybe if you worked out you wouldn't be so fat and a lazy piece of shit. you're the reason i drink. you're the reason i hate my life. i dread you coming home. "
26958,noncause,"so this is probably gonna sound dumb but can life get any worse? so basically my whole life my father figure was just an abusive drunk and my mom i have trust issues with.  i dont trust anyone since that got ruined by my family, and im failing in school too.  i have been depressed for 4 years and while that may not be as bad as some of you i can still relate and understand what this shit is like.  so to go back to my title is life ever getting any better cuz the way everything is goung rn i feel like i'm just gonna end up working a minimum wage job and life in a shitty apartment my entire life"
26959,noncause,"hey, im not here to advertise meds lol i just wanted to check in on my new account:) i feel less suicidal and less in my head all the time.  lets hope i can keep it up! i always thought that i was going to die before i reached my 30th birthday and that might still be, but as of right now i feel good about life ???"
26960,noncause,at this point in life i've just begun to believe that happiness is just a lie that adults teach kids in order to let them live out their childhoods and let them believe that good people that care about anything other than themselves and their selfish desires actually exist in this world.  like bruh i haven't been happy in over 8 years and you just want to tell me that that's actually thing that grown adults actually feel? am i alone here or do y'all agree?
26961,noncause,i miss the old me so much. . .  i never dealt with suicidal thoughts/depression this hard.  i hate it here
26962,noncause,"i don't know if i can post this here, but does anyone else feel a little better after flipping their pillow to the day side after crying into the other side and making it soaking wet? i'm just curious if anyone relates to this!"
26963,noncause,"i recently made this account just to ask for help.  im a 16 year old male and things have been going down hill.  i had a big crush on a girl for 6 month, i enjoyed every moment i spent just talking to her, i talked to her every day feeling like i was making progress to have something more than a friendship.  anyways she got a boyfriend who seemed everything that she wanted that i wasnt, for 2 weeks i was super sad and it was hard for me to live life with a clear mind, that was 3 months ago tho but for some reason today i feel lonely and that girl comes in my mind often and i start to overthink how ill never get a girlfriend or ill never become anything.  sorry if i wrote this badly im not good with writing.

26965,noncause,"i woke up just now with this thought.  it's 4 am and i'm not looking forward to the day at all.  i never am.  i'm tired of waking up.  i wish i would just slip away in my sleep.  it's too hard to live and try to get better, i have no hope i'll ever get better.  i've been desperate to die since 2018 when i was actually in a mental hospital for 2 weeks, i realized those people can't help me.  no one can.  i realized during my time in there i'm too far gone, even the other depressed people there didn't share my same sentiments or thoughts.  even in a mental hospital i felt like an outcast and misunderstood.  this world holds no answers for me.  but i just can't bring myself to kill myself.  my family holds me back.  honestly sometimes i think what if i just killed my folks and then myself, that'd be the best outcome. . .  thoughts like these have become normal and i just don't want to try anymore.  i don't want to get better.  i just want to pass away at this point.  i'm hanging on a thread. "
26966,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","it would be such a nice break from the pain and from letting people down and from being so tired running on empty from keeping the secret from everyone around me that  <e1> i have crippling depression </e1>  and thats  <e2> why i couldnt come to the party, thats why i couldnt get the work done, thats why i look like shit today, thats why i was late because i had to pick myself up off the floor, cover my bloodshot eyes with makeup and put a fake smile on to pretend im doing just fine and thats why im finally responding to your message 2 weeks later </e2> . its not going away, i get teased by a week or so of being the normal me and think everythings fine again.  i can be so funny and so happy and creative and cool and then i can be the exact opposite.  it makes me feel like im 1000 pounds when im reality i cant remember to eat and dont really care. so would a break from all this really be that bad? this isnt a way to live, my mind is ruining my life and it just doesnt feel worth it anymore. "
26967,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","im a senior in hs and  <e1> i fucking hate my life </e1> .   <e2> i have like 2 friends, who dont even really respond to my message.  everyone looks at me like im a stain on this planet.  also im adopted so i was thrown out like the fucking trash.  birth mom just left me in the hospital, lmaooo.  should have just swallowed or aborted me.  my adoptive parents just constantly judge me for not doing good on a test, going to college etc </e2> . ive been low key suicidal for awhile, too pussy to do it tho. "
26968,noncause,"there's nothing that causes my depression to just explode out of control more than things in my life being negatively impacted by circumstances outside my control.  i completely got shit on recently (in another post, i don't feel like retyping it lol)now here i am, surrounded by a bunch of boxes and shit all over the floor in the house where i was supposed to be living with my friends for the rest of the year, before getting a chance to do bigger and better things.  but, because of circumstances outside my control, i have to pack up my shit and leave again. feeling completely out of control and helpless is the literal worst feeling out of anything.  oh, and this also all happened right after i decided to stop taking the antidepressant i had been on for two years (with docs permission), but given that i was still in the hugely unstable phase, it was a fucking disaster.  i think i was more upset the past two weeks than i've ever been. fuck all this. "
26969,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","is been so hard for me to make friends, to fight, to learn, to keep up with myself. . . .  love being alone cause i don't need to hear all that bs everyone say about me but  <e1> i feel so alone not having a friend a family or a gf </e1> ,  <e2> i can't sleep well, i can't concentrated at all on all my stuff, my anxiety keep drowning me, my thoughts keep making me over think everything, i get desperate about my future </e2> , i want to do great but i can't  is like having a million rock on me, doing one thing good but having a hundred step back. i look for someone to share how i feel to make memories or anything, to be better but no one wants to be there, how can i fight if no one can't help me, where is the help when you need it? this is bs, i hate life, i hate my life, i hate everything, this is fu. . . . .  hard, don't you get it!??? is not the same, is not the fu. . . . . . .  same!!!!!"
26970,noncause,"i've been depressed for so long now.  i don't enjoy things like i should.  i don't have hobbies, i don't go out and have sober fun.  nothing really makes me happy.  my boyfriend makes me somewhat happy.  he's supportive and hes probably one of the most saner and logical men i have ever been with.  i love him.  i love how he treats me, i love his morals, i love how smart he is.  but sometimes i question if i'm happy with him because i'm just never happy in general.  i catch myself becoming super irritable and i've finally found my voice so when something bothers me instead of being a push over i voice my issues which may make me blow things out of proportion and half the time i can't tell if i am or not anymore. "
26971,"cause-effect((e1,e2))",hello i am luna.  i have struggled with depression ever since i was ten or eleven.  im eighteen now and it has gotten worse.  i am more stable and think more rationally than before.   <e1> my therapist and i realise that theres a very real chance of me never being able to be treated for my depression </e1> .   <e2> so in that case id always have to cope </e2> . if i look at my life id maybe give it a 3 out of ten.  its not like there arent any times when i feel okay.  there are some but mostly i just feel like shit and i am really unmotivated to do anything.  everything i achieve is done because of stress. if im gonna stay as miserable as i am now i just dont see the point in living.  right now im alive for my friends and family only.  im unhappy and i might never truly be happy again. 
26972,"cause-effect((e1,e2))","i'm always so tired from being depressed, i just cant do art anymore, its really frustrating seeing my friends improve, and i should be a better friend, but  <e1> i'm just jealous they're so good and i cant keep upare there any methods i can use, or like thoughts or something to help with this </e1> ,  <e2> its pretty frustrating </e2> "
26973,noncause,"i live with my boyfriend and i live him dearly. . . . but im beginning to feel so so depressed that i cant even clean the apartment (i tend to do it more than him now) and i just cant bring myself to go to work somedays even though its an amazing job and i love it so much. my bosses told me to come talk to them tomorrow and im seriously even more messed up now because i just have this feeling that im gonna lose my job or that im gonna fall apart in the meeting and i wont be able to keep it together and be professional. i just found out my abusive dad that i barley see or talk to anymore has cancer so now i have mixed feelings about that, and it just feels like the only thing i can do is eat and sleep.  but i have barley eaten. not to mention that i just feel like shit because my bf isnt really affectionate and i just. . . . i need help. . . i seriously fantasized about just disappearing into my bed sheets all day today.  just wanting to die. . . . . i just need to be held while i cry"
26974,noncause,"hello redditorsi just realised that i'm now finally starting to feel better.  i started to take the recommended medications seriously and not taking them random. though i honestly find it strange to feel better and i ask myself why am i happy and if i merit it.  i'm still hard on myself and have my down days and especially in the evening.  i still find it hard to accept that i have depression even if my therapist is telling me. now i doubt if i really have depression and that it was all made up as an excuse and attention seeking. my therapist still wants that i go in a psychiatric clinic, since there is still a lot of work to do but i tell myself that i shouldn't, i'm an impostor for asking so much help and that i should handle it alone. so just wanted to tell you to keep battling, that there is an ending and to listen to experts even if it sounds difficult to rely on others"
26975,noncause,"im a simple guy.  i just wanted a decent job.  a roof over my head, and not live to pay bills.  if theres rock bottom im there. i came to the realization that im an alcoholic recently.  i drink everyday and i dont think drinking half a bottle then taking some adderall so that i could drive to buy more drinks is what a normal person does.  im completely filthy right now and so is my living area.  i havent conducted any hygiene for days.  i dont care about anything anymore.  im not even disgusted at my own behavior.  i have nobody.  i just want to run away but theres nowhere to run.  its getting bad.  i barely have any motivation left.  its hard to keep trying and failing at everything. "
26976,noncause,"im on 40mg fluoxetine, was on 20mg but on first month of higher dose, been taking it a year but recently im feeling really hungry all the time to the point if i havent eaten for a couple of hours i get that shaky weak feeling, im craving sweet things when i didnt used to, would it be the medication causing this? im getting more depressed about how i look than anything else"
26977,noncause,"i am having a very terrible day dealing with depression as a result of these fatalistic indicators of inferiority such as a high 2d4d ratio and weaker physical traits.  i have the dread that i will never be good enough in a technical field or an artistic field.  quite frankly, i feel so useless, like a genetic failure.  why must i keep on going?call this absurd.  i sure wish i could see it that way.

26978,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","im failing university and i'm wasting my parents money on rent, food, gambling and drugs.  i've been depressed for the past 4 years and i see absolutely no way out. .  i have no ambition, and i'm a disappointment to my parents who sacrificed everything for me.  almost everyone i know is doing something with their lives and im just existing and i was hoping i was going to achieve way more than i did till now.  im supposed to start therapy soon, but  <e1> that's been delayed </e1>  cause  <e2> i got covid and i'm isolated in my room </e2>  and that's making my situation even worse"
26979,noncause,"m16 here.  i genuinely believe that im just a lazy piece of shit that fakes depression to get some excuses and attention.  im going to a mental hospital in a few weeks so i guess according to my therapist i am mentally ill.  i feel so empty and useless all the time and hate everything about every day but i still feel like ive just faked my way into it, as if im just making this all up, making myself feel bad on purpose.  its to a point where my mind doesnt allow me to feel any joy because. .  well idk. i also dont have any benefits from acting like that, my grades dropped from fairly straight as to ds.  but probably im just making up that im making this all up. sry for bad english im german/russian"

26982,"cause-effect((e2,e1))",well i felt my day was overwhelmed and i randomly started to cry when the bus was empty.  i wish i knew why i cried and honestly  <e1> it's frustrating </e1>  that  <e2> i don't even know why the fuck i've been feeling like this since 2 years ago </e2> . 
26983,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","i joined this sub a few years ago.  had reached a low point starting from when my grandmother died and reaching a head when i was broke, hungry, and homeless.  now im still pretty broke, not as hungry, and 50% homeless, but i have stopped feeding into the negative thoughts about myself and my situation.  life is already hard, i shouldnt give it an easier time beating me down.  which is easy to say, but that the change isnt instantaneous.  its taken me 3 years, and  <e1> i still have more years to go </e1>  cause  <e2> this is a life long battle </e2> .  but i refuse to bow down and let depression win.   i know my story isnt everyone elses story, but if i can keep fighting and start winning i know all of you can.

26984,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","i am female 19 and my bf is male 22.  we have dated for about 1. 5 years. my boyfriend called me a few hours ago and voiced his concerns about genetics in children.  he noted that i have had an eating disorder, struggles with feelings of depression, and anxiety.  he is concerned that this would be passed down to children. while i understand and share his concerns, i do not think he has the full picture. a few years ago i experienced sexual assault multiple times.   <e1> it resulted in an eating disorder </e1>  because  <e2> i thought if i got a flat chest and a flat ass then i would not be provocative or something </e2> .  i basically just felt really ashamed and at fault for what happened. . . so i starved myself.  i also was left with feelings of anxiety and depression because. . . no shit. no one in my family has/had an eating disorder, depression, or anxiety disorder. my point is that my struggles were environmentally and not genetically caused. to be fair, i had never told him about the assault because there never was a good time to bring it up and i felt comfortable around him so i just didnt wanna think back to it or talk about it. "
26985,noncause,"depression has taken a great hold of me this particular important year!!!! there are a lot of things that i have to study but i'm too afraid of failure to do them, sometimes i think that i'm stupid, sometimes people discourage me, i also have had some kind of addiction before which has destroyed my mental state, i can't think clearly now.  even the school therapist has made fun of me because of my depression, i have never felt angrier.  even seeing my friends discussing physics problems and i haven't even opened a single goddamn lesson of this subject makes me angry and envious of them, because i have been always on the top of my class for the last 7 years but now my life is ruined because of my addiction and depression.  what should i do?"
26986,noncause,"ive dealt with anxiety and depression my whole life.  ive been in therapy my whole life and recently started up again.  i have an amazingly supportive family. today i had a mental breakdown at work.  this is third in the year and a half ive been there.  it pays well, but its so demanding and overwhelming and it wrecks me 3/5 days or more each week. i dont feel like my depression is justified, but i cant help it.  it was a full on panic attack.  crying, puking, hyperventilating. i told my supervisor what was going on and she let me take the rest of the day off.  i feel so ashamed and embarrassed.  i just got done with a 4 day weekend.  that was supposed to be my time to recoup. i dont know why i cant function like a normal person.

26987,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","every day i fight with myself.   <e1> i stay up late into the night </e1>  because  <e2> i don't want the day to end </e2> .  not because i'm enjoying it, but simply because i just don't want to wake up in the morning and start the day all over again. however, when i wake up in the morning, all i want to do is sleep more.  sleep longer.  sleep forever. i hate starting a new day knowing that it's going to be exactly the same thing as the day before it, and the hundreds of days before that. i have nothing to look forward to.  nothing to be excited about.  nothing to propel me forward and convince me to keep going. i feel like i'm stuck in some kind of limbo.  perpetually caught between awake and asleep, not wanted to be a part of either. i don't know what to do anymore.  i could use some advice from anyone that feels they suffer the same injustices of life. take care of yourselves out there. .  and each other.

26988,noncause,"i miss my dog so much.  i am glad we brought him home but i wish we brought him home alive and happy instead of a box of ashes.  he got two more years to live after his surgery, he lived to be 12 years and 5 months, thats pretty old for a big dog like him but even that didnt feel like it was long enough.

26989,noncause,"so my marriage was not going well and i have been unhappy for a long time.  i got married for the wrong reasons.  after so many mental health issues and anxiety i worked up the courage to ask for the divorce.  sadly when the pandemic started.  it's been a year and we haven't moved forward with it but still on the works. . .  however does the guilt ever go away? my partner still hurts a year after the announcement. . .  they still claim they love me. . .  but i don't feel anything for them.  i care for them and in a way always want nothing but the best. . .  but i see them suffer and feel like i should sacrifice my self for them. . .  so the hurts stop, but that is what i was doing and was miserable and hate my life.  the only ways is forward with my life. . . .  but does the guilt go away?"
26990,"cause-effect((e2,e1))","a few months ago i opened up to my friends about how depressed ive been and how my anxiety has gotten really bad, and  <e1> they were both very surprised </e1>  because  <e2> i try and be really optimistic </e2>  irl (i was gettjng sick of faking it).  we used to text constantly every day and tell eachother everything, but after i opened up to them about my depressuon, they started planning things without me and stopped talking to me unless i started the conversation.  i dont like being alone.  i fucking hate it.  so i try to be the one to try and make plans, but even now they just blow me off and make excuses for why they cant hang out.  its all you can talk to me and im always here if you need anything until i actually need someone.  then you are busy"
26991,noncause,how do you handle being depressed or suicidal but too scared to die?
26992,noncause,"i know how and why im depressed im actively aware of it all the time, ive reached out for help but its taking time.  i honestly just accept ill be like this forever and theres nothing that can be done.  im also extremely anxious and will not do things if i really dont want to.  idk what to do and im afraid my overwhelming sadness will get the better of me"
26993,noncause,i am gonna be a failure.  i have gone miles for people who won't even go a meter for me.  i am probably gonna end up jobless and a burden on my family.   i smile and laugh everyday but deep down i just want to die.  i am in constant pain everyday.  i don't even know what's gonna happen in my life.  i am so done with everything and everyone.  i want eternal peace in my life. 
26994,noncause,"so my depressed bf (25m) is finally ready to get help.  he wants change in his life and he's realizing he doesn't want to feel the way he does right now the rest of his life.  (which i'm so happy that he is wanting help now).  tomorrow he will go and see a family doctor just to get a check up and then will hopefully see a psychiatrist after to look into medication.  i understand that not all medication is a one size fits all and generally takes time to see positive results.  i am worried that during this time, he will push me away again. . .  but i also want to stay positive and hope that he will let me stay by his side and go through this with him. for anyone who has an so that has taken medication or is the one on medication, do you have any advice how i can best support my so during this, while he starts taking medication?thank you! :)"
26995,noncause,"the title says it all : what mark of affection made you feel ??good/better?? ? i am asking because i suffered from depression for 6 years and no one seemed to care.  i kind of got my way out of it and sometimes i feel waves of depression coming back.  lately, i have been dealing with a sick/depressed bf.  he broke up with me to protect me from everything happening and weve been talking and flirting on and off. i have shown support and love since day 1 and i still do.  i just sat down with myself this morning wondering ??wow. . .  i hope he still feels supported . . .  i wish someone did that for me when i was depressed??.  that dude supported and still supports me as best as he can. . .  sometimes.  but besides him, i have never felt like someone had my back you know ? especially during depression. so yeah. . .  i know everyone is different but what kind of things (a word, a gesture etc) made you feel the most supported, understood, loved while battling with depression?take care of you guys ? and thanks for reading ?"

"
26997,noncause,"so normally i feel this way after talking to this person i know.  i want to make people happy but every time i out in the effort, nothing comes out of it.  plus i miss the feeling of being loved by someone in a relationship.  all these things tie into why i dont feel happy but its not like i cant do things throughout the day.  its hard to explain the feeling but i just want a way to explain myself so i could feel better. "
26998,noncause,"and i'm still crying.  i have things i need to get done today, but being in emotional distress is getting in the way and it's making me so frustrated. i've been in therapy for nearly three years and i'm taking remeron, which has been doing well for me up until now.  but today of all days, for whatever reason, i'm burdened by fears of being alone and widely disliked.  the worst part is that i know my friends and family love me and would do anything for me.  but my mind works like a fun house mirror and distorts every positive to a negative. my brother physically, emotionally, and verbally abused me every day until i was 16.  i never deserved it and i'm such a kind person.  i'm not even angry with him anymore, i'm just upset that i can't even be happy when i'm alone with my thoughts.

"
27001,noncause,"i dont know if this will make sense.  but does anyone reach a level of depression where everything is funny, in a morbid way? i make jokes to my friends and family about death and funny things that i would like written on my gravestone.  i sometimes hate life so much its humorous.  i guess its some sort of way of coping. "
27002,noncause,"i really hate being so worn out from work i have absolutely have no desire do anything at all.  even on my days off i can't find any energy.  all i want to do is lay down and sleep. i never get any productive done.   at best i might go to the store ad buy supplies and that is it.  sometimes i manage to make a list, but i don't do anything on the list.
