When you are anxious your body gets into flight or fight mode. Your body reacts to this in different ways. One of the ways your body responds is by tightening muscles so that you can actually fight or flight. Some of these muscles are in your shoulders. Now try to pay attention to your shoulders and let them hang. They feel tight right? Try to relax them. Try to push them down to the point that feel naturally. In this way, your body signals that you are not in extreme state of alert. This also has a positive influence on the mental part of your anxiety.

So I’m asking for some advice on how to handle/lessen my anxiety which I don’t really know the cause of because it makes it hard for me to sleep and Google didn’t really help much since most of the articles I looked at were for people with more stressful, full-time jobs. Thank you in advance for any tips!"

Even with friends and I feel like a pussy, pathetic, etc. Because of it. And these conversations may arise because of something he did or something we need to sort out as a couple. It may be fear of abandonment or just pure anxiousness. What are some things you do to stop feeling this way, or any tips? Thanks."

It had been about 10 years (I didn't go at all when I was undiagnosed schizoaffective) and so I needed a lot of work, including an extraction. Long story short, I (obviously) survived, used my DARE method I've been practicing, and felt pretty proud about myself yesterday.Today though, I feel like an anxious mess again. I was hoping that feeling good after conquering my fear would last longer. Am I just having some rebound anxiety? Or am I wrong to think my anxiety would suddenly get better?

One thing I’ve been thinking of lately is how people with anxiety are often more sensitive than the rest of the population. I notice in myself that even now that my anxiety is way lower, I still need more time then the average person to digest my experience. I get easily overwhelmed and I’m only now learning how to live my life in such a way that I take my sensitivity into account. Before I would get very hard on myself for not being able to do as much as others. But now I see that this just seems to be a part of how my nervous system is wired.

22068	"This might be really helpful for you guysAs far as NTs are concerned, how much you write something correlates to how much you care. <e1> When you type a lot about some thing when others are only typing 1-2 sentences </e1> , you come off as  <e2> angry and emotional </e2> . To us, or at least me, it’s better to elaborate so that I make sense than it is to say 2 contextless sentences with no evident thought process. This will make people think you’re taking it too seriously and are legitimately mad about it.Ironically, in the corporate world, this rule is here as well, but it goes the opposite way. If you can say it in two sentences and do, it sounds like you don’t really care that much or are inept. It’s better to put in a bunch of fluff than get straight to the point because it shows you care? Or something.Both of these rules are weird. Wouldn’t it be better in all contexts to write enough to make sense, but not so much that people stop paying attention because they’re bored?This still explains so much.When you type a lot about some thing when others are only typing 1-2 sentences make angry and emotional take place.

She was writing about positivity and being kind, she was talking about that with me too.

She would treat me like trash and abuse me while at the same time preaching about spirituality and positivity, in a blink of an eye she could turn violent too if she got really mad.

FP stayed with me throughout and did everything to soothe me, virtually.And then today was pretty nice, you know? When I’m anxious, my chest start aching a lot. While talking to him, I felt something again but it was not hurt. It felt like the opposite of anxiety.I don’t know how this is real. He’s amazing.

Maybe we could build some safe, low-pressure support system for each other, where we could find some positive and reassuring voice whenever our own becomes too critical towards us ?"

22498	"So I just had a massive fit of emotional flashback in the psychiatric ward yesterday, weeping uncontrollably, digging my nails into my flesh and one step away from banging my head against the wall. Today a therapist came to discuss coping skills with me (short term inpatient therapy). Unfortunately, it was barely helpful. Not only do I know the skills, I have been actively practicing mindful breathing and grounding techniques every day for years. They are definitely helpful, but there is a threshold where they are simply utterly useless. There are episodes of flashbacks that can be calmed with techniques, and then there are ones that are not much different from being strangled by an invisible demon. In those times, the idea of coping skills basically boils down to try doing something different and try harder. That doesn't help someone being strangled. The conversation led me to one question: Has anyone experienced something similar, going through a massive episode of suicidality with all the awareness and logical thinking well intact, all the coping skills well trained, and yet none of those seem helpful?"

This can be a memory (for me since I have amnesia that's mostly not the case ) or a trembling / shacking and emotion (that's the case for me most of the time )So whenever your symptoms skyrocket, are unbearable, be assured that there is something looking to leave your body.This formula makes something terrible bearable.I hope this helps, it might be obvious to you but with the confusion during high symptom states, this might be something worth putting a note on your fridge for."

Yes, ADHD means you hate sitting around doing nothing. So what?  You don't NEED to enjoy sedentary things! The happiest ADHD people I know spend their free time biking, hiking, running, fixing cars, making stuff, camping, writing, playing board games, reading, climbing, and jumping out of airplanes.   And the TV watchers? They're jealous of how exciting these active lives look. They watch TV SHOWS about people like that.  So...if your friends are boring couch potatoes, the problem is not that you're too ADHD. The problem is that you need to find friends who like the same things you do.   They're out there. Join a makerspace. Start a makerspace. Make webcomics! But don't feel like a loser because you don't enjoy staring at the idiot box. It's people like you who go out and build the future!  Tl/DR  It's not a defect not to like staring at a glowing screen. You don't need to be like everyone else. It's OK to want to DO stuff with your leisure time. "

I have a follow-up appointment in a few weeks, but I want to know in the meantime if this is to be expected. Is it a sign of too-strong a dosage? Is it a sign I don't actually have ADHD (as some forums would suggest)? There's some scary stuff about adderall out there, I don't want to get addicted or anything.

I understand that one of it's goals is to identify your thought patterns and start to break them down and question them and provide counter evidance to show why those thoughts are irrational.  Also to slowly expose you to situations that may trigger those thoughts.  I'm just wondering if CBT is more a general approach to therapy (which then largely depends on how your therapist interacts with you) or if its more structured and follows a set of lessons, exercises, homework...etc."

I am extremely empathetic, when I am happy it's on a whole other level, I am very expressive, I am passionate, I get very excited, I am artistic. In some ways I think I am capable of loving someone on a different level than most as well. I think these can and may relate to BPD in some way but I think they are good things. I will always work on the negative aspects of me but I don't want to lose the positives.Does anyone share these thoughts? Are there positive aspects of yourself that you believe may relate to BPD?

I'll be signing up for an individual care plan but none of them cover prescriptions until after the deductible, which is $6500. I am taking Pristiq, which would cost me $275 a month out of pocket. The cheapest I can get it online is $120 a month, which would maybe be do-able but it would put a big strain on my budget.  I had a long, hard battle at the beginning of this year finding an antidepressant that worked for me until I found Pristiq so I think I've exhausted all of the cheaper alternatives.

It has gotten less over the years, and I have never done anything to try and lessen the reaction. By coincidence I found a text on the subject which recommended flexing stomach muscles if you could feel a fainting reaction coming on. I tried it a couple of times and it seems to work. The idea is that it increases blood flow to the brain, and thus makes you less likely to faint. The thing is, I found that it also works for types of anxiety, I've always been anxious towards public speaking, and now when I do so I flex my stomach muscles, and it actually makes me feel more confident and more daring.      Is this placebo or something else? It might be a good suggestion for others to try this too, it might work for you as well. "

Today, I leave for vacation to go to a huge outdoor cocktail party tomorrow and then a huge tailgate the next day. I plan to drink heavily both days, and I have a few concerns:Is drinking on Concerta safe? I did some googling and it seems that people argue both ways. My pharmacist told me that when mixed with alcohol, the extended release component is broken down more quickly and so the 54mg is released much quicker, which could potentially cause an issue. In response to this, I figured my best option would be to either not take my Concerta for these two days, or just take a smaller dose like 18mg. I'm worried, though, that skipping two days of the medication after taking it for two weeks could be bad though.Is it safe to drink on? And if not, is it okay to skip two days?"

He then upped that to 10mg at the start of my shift and 5mg 4 hours later.I'm 26 and while I'm happy to finally have an official diagnosis. I wonder if I should be talking to a psychiatrist or a specialist. How do you guys generally feel about this?Also, I'm wondering if I should be taking my adderall on other days as well. He said  <e1> it's great to not take the adderall over the weekends </e1>  as  <e2> it prevents my body from getting reliant on it </e2> .

I have another appointment in about three weeks and I'll inquire about other medications; I've read that dexmethylphenidate aka Focalin is a cleaner, smoother version of Ritalin.

If I am holding a grudge against someone, they obviously have made me angry in some way. People think that my thinking is extremely distorted because of my diagnosis. I sometimes don't know how to express why I am angry at someone because of it. Many of the reasons why people anger me seem to be trivial to others. For instance,  <e1> I become angry at someone </e1>  because of  <e2> the way he/she treats me </e2> . Whenever I bring up my anger toward them in conversation, I am constantly told to grow upthe way he/she treats me make I become angry at someone take place. "

I saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed 100mg of Zoloft, which helped some.  I didn't really care what happened to me, so I did a lot of drugs. Like hard drugs. It was bad for a few months. Anyway, my girlfriend of a couple years knew I was going through rough times, but I never told her about the drugs. I only told my therapist and he told me to never tell her and not do it again.  The point I'm getting to is my girlfriend asks me if I have used drugs before and I just lie and hope she never mentions it again. If she knew, it would probably end our relationship. I don't like lying and I don't want to lose her."

I assume most of us have a good imagination here, so something I like to do is think about the *results* that would come out of dedicating myself to something.  But not just thinking about it, really envisioning it, try to imagine how it would make you feel. For example, if you can't bring yourself to do homework think about what it would be like to ace all your classes.  Think about how proud your family would be and how relieving it would feel.  Or if you can't bring yourself to finish some work at your job, think about what it would be like to do an outstanding job and receive a big bonus or a promotion, think about all the things you could do with that money. Personally, this helps me to actually realize the benefits that could result out of the time I put into things.  In this way I can help orient myself more towards long term goals as opposed to short term goals."

Obviously for me it's normal but I now am very conscious of how much noise is going on in there, conversations, bits of songs on constant repeat - CONSTANT repeat, more conversations, what was that sound....etc etc.. Now that I am conscious of it, I want quiet. Just a little bit.  I guess my question is, does anyone else deal with this and if so do you have any strategies that have worked for you to get some peace and quiet? I do know working allows me some peace, but it's more of a major distraction that requires serious focus but not silence.

It has helped me focus, which has been a blessing academically. Secondarily, it seems to reliably alleviate my brain fog. I define brain fog as feeling generally understimulated, fried out (numb), and some anhedonia. This may very well be depression I am describing, but I cannot really convey how I feel in a way that will resonate with doctors, let alone a public forum. I don't really feel excessive anxiety or sadness, so it's tough.   Adderall doesn't give me euphoria, but it makes me feel more immersed in daily life. Oh, and it completely lifts my IBS. I like that, but I am scared the effects will fade of I take it more often. On the other hand, it would be great to feel better grounded 5 days per week.   Is the brain fog alleviation something I can expect to fade or will it stay? If it is likely to fade, I will consider asking my doctor for an SSRI or Wellbutrin.   Thank you.

For those that didn't click away, I have not been diagnosed with ADHD recently; my last diagnosis was around when I was 11, and we know how inaccurate that can be sometimes. But I've looked up the root causes of ADHD, as well as the overall lifestyle an undiagnosed ADHD'er goes through, and it was a near accurate representation of my life, another feeling I'm sure many here are familiar with.  So, when a project for college came up about pretty much anything, I chose to base it around ADHD. But during our discussion with the class's chosen topics, one student brought up the subject of people wondering if ADHD is actually real in the first place. I immediately shrugged it off as simply uninformed people who would say that, but in the quest of intellectual honesty, the first subject I was inclined to research was is ADHD real or not?  I got pretty much what I was expecting"

Characteristics of a good course could include instant feedback, lots of interactivity (e.g. quizzes, short assignments), lectures/notes broken down into short topics, course available 'on-demand', active discussions boards and so on.  As an example, I found [MITx's Intro to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-8) quite good. The lecture videos are split up so each topic is covered in less than 20 mins (making it easy to focus on when first learning and easy to go back and reference later). There was also lots of mini quizzes and assignments. The only downside is that the material was released week by week - I would have a ton of motivation, do four weeks then run out of assignments/lectures then wait a month until doing another couple of weeks all at once (instead of working through it week by week like you're suppose to).

I've cut maybe twice in my life, and very often have the impulse/thought to do so when I'm very angry with myself or want to punish myself, but I almost never follow through. So I often turn to slapping myself in the face, on the wrists, and putting a rubber band on my wrist and snapping it over and over it again. Sometimes I punch walls and other things to hurt my knuckles. Obviously these things hurt and leave the skin red, sometimes with welts, but that's it. Is this self harm?

For instance, with meeting my partner's friends family, I am nervous the first time I hang out with them, and tend to be quiet and timid in conversation. It helps if they are in small groups and a more low-key setting like a quiet dinner rather than a noisy bar. After I've spent a bit of time around them (usually the next time we hang out, or the time after that) I am much more comfortable and conversations flow more easily, and act like my regular self. It hasn't gotten in the way of making close friendships or having an engaging career that has lots of interpersonal contact. Nonetheless this has been really frustrating to my partner. He feels that my anxiety around new people is hindering his social lifeI can be slow to come out of my shell around new people lead to I'm an introvert and have what I would characterize as moderate social anxiety.

I had undiagnosed anxiety as a child which manifested in mostly physical symptoms,  such as random vomiting/digestive issues/ulcers. When I was first diagnosed with anxiety (Feb 2016), the psychiatrist I saw said the physical symptoms are more common in children. Especially the ones I discribed to him. Had anyone experienced any of the physical symptoms later in life?  If so which ones? And how do you deal with them? "

This is what  <e2> started the habit for me </e2> . 1% rule.  This is a method used to create new habits, but it can be applied to almost any situation.It functions off the perception that accomplishing something so small can add up. Say you want to make writing a habit, but cant get around to it.So you write ONE word. There, you're done.It's silly isn't it? But strangely you've accomplished your goal, and here you are either laughing about how stupid what you're doing is or feeling hopeful for a breakthrough.Regardless, that is apparently how neural pathways work. You need to reinforce them. There is NO EASIER way to break down successes into miniscule chunks until they become large enough to have an impact on your life. Chances are if you're a hard working ADHD'er, you'll try to push more than 1% or one word.You'll write two. Then three. Then ten. Until you feel accomplished. Then before longI found the book - It's Mini Habits by Stephen Guise is the reason of started the habit for me. "

I've been on nearly every medication possible, yet now down to a handful of options, I am stuck constantly fighting insurance(step therapy).Since September 1, I heave been burglarized, hospitalized (lithium), had a terrible amount of skin issues after trying laminctal....and repeatedly denied new options by insurance.I finally told my pdoc that life changing thoughts had been on my mind constantly. That while after dozens of other medications, lithium was the first I hadn't felt those thoughts. But non-perishable trash had packed up 11 bags worth since then. Dishes not cleaned in 9 months. Not even a visit to a grocery store in a year and a half. These actions may not be suicidal, but possibly still depressed?I really don't know where I am going with all of this information.

She denies, lies, demeans, manipulates, destroys, etc.  She herself was raised by a narcissist and shows signs of other mental illnesses.We've know the NM and DoNM since just after the child was born and for the most part things have been manageable, but always decaying.  Things have gotten to the point that she has cut off contact to anyone DoNM could/does care about more than her, including the unofficial adoptive father.  The NM has stated her intentions to home school DoNM in her own way (ala Dogtooth).  Even the mother of NM (again also an NM), has stated that NM is unfit to be a parent and has threatened to call CPS (although she's obviously been a wild card through it all).I assume the likely route is to talk to CPS, but saying she's a narcissist"

24856	"Hi all, I was diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks about 6 months ago. And from about 6 months before that I had been complaining to the doctors about having random dizzy spells in the mornings. The dizziness now lasts pretty much all day, even on a good day for my anxiety. The doctors have now put that down to a symptom of my anxiety. I get crackling and ringing in my ears too so I'm convinced that the dizziness is not related to the anxiety. It literally has no correlation between its good days and my anxieties good days. My question here is, if it is related and any of you have experienced it, does anyone have any tips or strategies to lessen the effect as the dizziness is really starting to get me down now.  If it helps, I'm 22, male, from the UK. First time poster on this sub Reddit. Thanks all I really would appreciate any help/advice no matter how large or small!"

For some people, it has proven to have tremendous benefits and it is helpful for many people.   However, when I practice mindfulness, it has a complete opposite effect.  When I sit and try to practice mindfulness - focusing on breathing, resetting my mind when it defocuses, etc - I get tremendously anxious and it has even sent me into panic episodes in the past.  In my normal (typically mildly depressed and other times generally anxious) state, I can manage.  I don't like it, but I manage.  When I practice mindfulness, as advised by my doctors and therapists, the weight of my depression and anxieties increase tenfold and I just feel horrific.   Is this something that happens to some people?  Am I doing something wrong?  What should I say to a counselor that continues to push mindfulness?"

I work multiple jobs and can sometimes find it impossible to make it to a meeting when I feel like I need to or want to go. I make it at least 3 times a week, which seems like a lot but if I don't go basically every day I start feeling really guilty about it (this is something I'm trying to figure out too, why the guilt?)...though in order to attend meetings sometimes I have to skip homefamily obligations (cue the guilt and procrastination on tasks to complete at home). That's sort of what's happening today, even typing this right now I need to be off to my next activity but the gnawing feeling of going to a meeting is getting to me. It can feel like a catch-22 sometimes.  I found a sponsor last night and enjoyed that group so I'm holding onto the idea of that being my home group, which is helpful, but man it's like I feel guilty and like I let myself down no matter what I do."

The start of my decline was roughly around the time I started dating my boyfriend who is much more outgoing and enjoys me being over with his family etc etc (I'm so anxious around them). Since we started dating a few years ago, I've lost control of my school work and have left school (which has always been my main priority and I was great at it). I have also curled into a little ball of uselessness in terms of doing regular people things. Anyways, my usually extremely supportive boyfriend told me that he thinks my BP is unhealthily ruling the relationship for both of us. Initially I felt heartbroken but now a couple of days later I'm going out and doing things, I called my school and I'm arranging going back, I'm running and going to the gym. My question is: **Has the sudden breakup thrown me into hypomania (even though I'm medicated), or has the relationship I loved really made me too comfortable and now I'm coming out of my cave and living for me again?**"

Then I looked up my symptoms and found out it was dpdr. It only lasted for 2weeks then I was back to normal. But I smoked the same day. In November I smoked again then stopped and was somewhat depressed during thanksgiving break. But what happened n December changed me. I had two panic stacks the first week.

(I have been depressed as well, but fortunately the depression is better now.)My anxiety is always with me, but lately I noticed that it gets a lot worse the week before my period. I have panic attacks daily, often more than once, I can't be social since my social anxiety also gets a lot worse.When I realised that my pms made it worse, I started keeping track of when I should have it, and I feel a bit better knowing that my anxiety will be somewhat better in about a week.Anyone else experiencing something similar?

I dont get super high, I just get a mild high for a very long time.  I have smoked heavily for 5 years. When I started smoking I was 14 years old, if that has anything to do with it. To be honest, I expected day 43 to feel a lot better than it does now. Im still feeling very similar to when I smoked weed, I can hardly tell myself apart. The one thing I can say that has changed is this:Dreams. I always get dreams, every night or any time im asleep. But the dreams focus has changed since I quit, and for some odd reason mostly all my dreams include me smoking weed with other people. After I smoke in the dream, I always say to myself Dam I just broke my longest streak ever.  There are also other changes in the dreams but its hard to explain them. So yea im kinda discouraged atm"

And that's pretty much the loop that I've been stuck in. I'm looking for some guidance I guess. What am I not doing? Or what am I doing wrong? I wish I could just have an unshakeable and firm belief in some sort of higher power who can help me, like so many others seem to have."

One of the nights we were away we all got particularly messy and after everyone had gone to sleep my boyfriend, one of our friends (let's call him Jay) and I decided to play strip poker but only down to our underwear. Myself and Jay were far drunker than my boyfriend and he hadn't had to remove any items of clothing before we were already in our underwear. My boyfriend ending up convincing me to take off my bra and Jay was covering his eyes and saying Are you sure? Like this is awesome but are you sure?"

Doctors said that I would live, just needed staples, etc, but from that experience I've cried so much in the last couple of days than I have ever cried in my life. it really fucked me up and i realized i could have died there. whenever i close my eyes i just see my arms in front of me doing that fucking response and i feel like a wreck and not myself. i dont know if I'm suffering from ptsd or something but i guess I just needed a place to vent my feelings."

At least this allows me to clearly see things from both perspectives.I just wanted to point out that, as a non smoker, it takes(took) me an hour to wake up in the morning. As a smoker, I could just smoke two cigarettes and have my body up and running. Nicotine is, after all, an extremely potent parasympathomimetic. Smoking allowed me to skip breakfast, lunch and even dinner.Now that this has gone I need to readjust to this pharmacological reality. When I lose concentration, I need to take a 5 minutes walk and fresh air. I need to drink green tea. I need to eat breakfast.

I was able to sit down and finish tasks to completion, without trailing off at all. The best thing is I was able to identify which problems in my daily life were because I lacked motivation and which were brought on by the disorder. It was fascinating to finally get a clear picture that I was definitely lazy and a procrastinator, but I also lacked the ability to finish anything without having to start ten other tasks.

26143	"Whenever an embarrassing memory or thought pops up randomly in my head, I have a jerk instinctive reaction to yell or cringe. Yes, almost everyone has these stupid cringey thoughts, but this seems like that on steroids.Triggers (Man I hate that word now) range from moments throughout my whole life where I've made myself look like a fool, to hypothetical scenarios I imagine. Reactions only happen when the thoughts randomly appear. If I consciously try to remember the thought, I don't have a jerk reaction. Reactions vary based on my environment. While I don't have conscious control of my reaction, it's like I subconsciously am aware of my surroundings and the reaction is not as obvious when people are around.Examples: I think of some embarrassing moment from my past in the middle of class. I'll tense up my muscles and furiously give the floor the middle finger under my desk for a few seconds. Either that or I cuss up a storm under my breath.Same thing happens but I'm alone in my room with family in the house. I may weirdly contort my body or repeatedly say I hate myself"

I did not do a slow taper I jumped from a lot per day to a little so I can sleep and work. Life was complete shit for about a week but I made it through . One perk of having such a steep taper going from 20-25 gs a day to a couple teaspoons is I saved a lot of time (and money) spent on kratom.I'm seeing the light.  If you can't physically and mentally afford to go CT you should definitely try a slow taper. Read the taper guide I like Aleve Pm , black seed oil and a good magnesium calcium and zinc supplement.Also Eat better . Cost co has premade bags of quinoa mixed with sweet potatoes, kale and I throw some salmon and eggs in there . Have one bowl daily and it helped tremendously.

I definitely don't want to wait until September to seek solutions for this. Can I ask to talk to her or have her call me back when I call for a refill? Do I need to wait until it's time to call for a refill, or should I call before then?TL;DR I don't like ritalin as a booster and would like to change but I don't wanna wait until my next appointment.

I am currently deleting all games from my pc (don't own any consoles atm) so steam, blizzard, random facebook games (I know I know you might say those don't count but still) and even deleting them makes me feel more empty but I know it's something I have to do.

I have been listening to my physical reactions (anxiety attacks are my main identifier), and I am so frustrated with the interaction I have with my mother and father. I am feeling so unsure if they are also narcissists. I feel I have always had a close relationship with my family, but as an adult with 2 children, I should not have to worry about their judgment or pleasing them as much as I do. I have two friends that are safe places, other than that, I am so confused. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I need the Narc energy out of my life and I need help identifying it consistently.

I suppose what I generally think of as panic attacks are different than what I seem to have. I barely notice I'm having an episode, basically until it's over. It usually starts with nothing feeling particularly real, progressing into thinking I'm going to die. But it's not a thing where I'm scared, it more just feels inevitable in a sort of fatalistic way. Usually there's a physical component, either ad a tightness of the chest, a trembling jaw, or shaking hands.I definitely feel anxious, but not the way I expect, I guess. Now that I type this out it sounds stranger than it did in my head. Are these panic attacks?

At one point he spoke about growing up in a household of rigid, stiff love and how he didn't have much family support. He also spoke a lot about why he got into certain hobbies such as the gym or playing sports, how he was treated at school, etc. I found it odd how relatable it was. I could've been saying some of these things to someone verbatim. It was oddly reassuring. But I haven't really had the chance to tell anyone about this. Most may not achieve Cena's level of professional success but I believe people can achieve his level of self acceptance and resilience and persistency. I've found it hard lately (especially coming off a very good first half year where I was feeling good) but hearing Cena talk about the aftermath of his self betterment is encouraging.  The older I get the more I appreciate and respect John Cena. "

I used to do opiates before this; the withdrawals aren't nearly as severe IMO as far as pain and uncomfortability, but worse when it comes to temperature regulation. I haven't gone more than 5 days without dosing since my dependence began so I don't know what to expect long term.Anyone have any suggested reading, science, tips and tricks, and the like?Tysm!I need support lead to I'm happy I found it.

I have developed a habit where I wake up the first morning in a panic attack, that then lasts for the next two days. After the second day at the job I am so drained physically and emotionally and exhausted that I leave the job and go home feeling defeated. And then the next day I feel completely fine, albeit depressed. I REALLY want to end this cycle and understand that a good way to do it is to face the panic head on rather than giving in to the exhaustion and overwhelm...but how am I supposed to confront the panic when I am currently feeling completely fine?
