I took adderall through middle and some high school. So far, I think focalin is so much better than my memories of adderall.  When I think of my experiences with adderall, I am reminded of the crippling side effects.  Mainly, <e1>the social withdraw I felt from adderall was the worst</e1>.  Others included <e2>extreme dry mouth and absolutely no appetite</e2>.  Granted, some of this could be attributed to <e3>too high of a dosage</e3>. Negative Side Effects Focalin on the other hand has produced no extreme negative side effects.  Some loss of appetite is there, but I still felt a bit hungry and was able to eat consistently the last 2 days. Intended EffectsThe intended side effects are there and they are amazing.  I can read a chapter straight through mostly without having to stop and reread the same sentence 3 times.

During school I procrastinated hard, wouldn't remember what happened in class, and would get B's or worse after Junior High (Last year of Junior High I was honor roll 3/4 terms). I assumed it was because I got a computer and decided it was way more fun/important. I also loved to Daydream, live in my own fantasy world for a while. That died down around my mid 20's. I kind of miss it.  As I got older, though, I found I was still circling things, lot of dreams... not a lot of follow through. And it always seemed like I lived in a semi fog, that I couldn't remember what happened day to day (I read about Slow Cognitive Tempo, but that's very extreme for my issues I feel). My college tries were B's or F's. I'll do that homework later. Okay.

And I feel like even if I force it it would look wrong because it wouldn't touch my eyes or something. I do find it harder to have internal emotional reactions too, but the face thing is disproportionate to that, even if something makes me feel happy I have to force the smile on meds. During conversations I sometimes be aware that I'd usually have a smile on while talking to this person but I don't, the best I can do is force intermittent smiles.

That can lead them to overreact or shut down when stressed but also often leads to a fine-tuned sense of intuition and a sense of justice.  After recently getting back on Adderall--I've had a couple of mishaps with my prescriptions--I feel like there's less  oise in my head. I feel as if I still have emotions.

Exceptions to this is if I fall into a light sleep or can manage to daydream something interesting.  If I take my 36mg Concerta it helps that a bit (It's no miracle drug though) . I'm already shy w/o it but on a cruise a lot of the fun is meeting strangers and making new friend.   <e1>I heard that exercising can help a lot instead of medicine</e1> so <e2>I was thinking I could just start the day of doing like half an hour of cardio in the ships gym in the morning</e2>.   thank you all for reading this, adhd is tricky to manage.

On the iPhone (and I'm sure Android does, too, but I don't know the specifics) I can set reminders that will trigger based on location rather than time or date. For example, I'm current traveling for work and eating by myself at a restaurant. I looked down and saw one of my shoelaces is looking a little thin. So I picked up my phone and said to Siri: Remind me when I leave here to buy shoelaces. My phone then set a reminder titled Buy shoelaces and set it so that as soon as the built-in GPS detects I've left my current location it will pop up and tell me that.  It also recognizes places like ""home"" and ""my office"" so I can say ""Remind me when I get home to take out the trash"" and it will do exactly that. Way handier (to me) than time-based reminders.

I also had the feeling I could never proportion something. For example, if I had a beer, I had to get more beers after that. Not that alcohol was ever a problem for me, but once I started drinking on an evening, I constantly needed more.  I'm also addicted to cigarettes.  Now as far as my problem goes...

"Or, how can I convince my new psychiatrist that I'm not a junkie.   I've been on Adderall XR for several years and I've found that it works well for me. I usually only take it when I'm working (I work 4 10-12 hour shifts a week, and even then I usually don't take it every day) or if I have some huge project that needs to get done. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was in middle school and I've tried Ritalin and some other prescription but I experienced unpleasant side effects. With Adderall the only side effects I've had are loss of appetite and dry mouth.   Now I've moved to a different state and I have a new insurance company who referred me to a new psychiatrist. I had a phone consultation with him, and he kept repeatedly saying that he wanted to explore non stimulant options with me. I told him that I was happy with my current meds and that I didn't want to try a new medication.

"I was diagnosed with Adult ADD primarily inattentive a few years ago and have been on Adderall as my primary treatment as required. Lifestyle adjustments and Adderall have helped tremendously (high school me would have laughed at the idea of my strengths being a good work ethic and dedication to a task) but a few years ago I did get tested for low testosterone and low and behold I have already below normal levels and my free testosterone was notable below the low end of normal.  At that time I was actively lifting, eating plenty of protein in redmeats and getting plenty of iron and other required nutrition for a healthy early to mid 20's male so my levels would have at least been higher at that time than right now (in theory at least)  While Adderall has helped, I would like to get off or at least reduce my overall dose even though it isn't that high to being with.  If anyone has gotten treated for hormonal issues, especially males and testosterone, has that helped with any of the ADD like symptoms especially the inattentive type symptoms?

It's been quite a while since it was that bad, I mean I felt sad all day, and no matter how much I tried to socialize and stuff, I just was not my self anymore.  But on the other days, I sleep like 4 or 5 hours and I'm MUCH better. What is this? Less sleep = no anxiety? wtf.  Is there any correlation between sleep and anxiety for you guys? What do you know?

I asked a Lead in the Department if anyone had come by to unlock it and she said no but that she called LP and someone was supposed to be coming. I was the only LP still in the building, so I said I'd try real quick. Then I noticed that the fitting room had a different handle/lock than all the other ones I've ever unlocked. I said that I didn't know how to unlock that one. The Lead said she'd called LP earlier and some guy (Bob Jones) had sounded like he had no idea what she was talking about. Funny thing is that Bob told me that she didn't seem to know what he was talking about when he'd talked to her. It's worth noting that there are two Bobs in my department. Bob Smith and Bob Jones.

"Hi there. This advice is something that came about after reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (which I strongly recommend if you have issues with anxiety). He says to imagine that you have already died, and that every moment in time is a gift from the gods, time you otherwise wouldn't have, time that you should cherish. This is also a very good advice, but I've found it more applicable to imagine that every moment is my last, and it works for me. If Marcus' original advice works for you however, then go for it.   Regardless, this line of thought has nearly cleared my anxiety and issues. I'm more calm, relaxed, enjoy the moment and I can focus on what's important without getting anxious about ridiculous things, such as what other think of me. I know this type of advice may be strong, maybe not suitable for everyone, it may even just be a more specific version of karpe diem but generally the same.. Either way.

"I just enrolled in college in my country. Here it is a tradition that all freshman are hazed. Hazings consist of stuff like walking around campus on all fours, singing degrading songs about oneself really hard, having cow dung stuck inside our clothes, simulating sexual acts with female freshman.  There is really very little point trying to avoid it. A few martyrs declare themselves anti-hazing and they get ridiculed and chased around campus.  I'm a very justice centered kind of guy, I take this kind of abuse really badly. I can feel the anger building inside me while its happening, when I arrive at home I flay around in anger and powerlessness. I'm not a small dude, I'm afraid I will snap out and injure someone during the hazings. Not that the fucking bastards dont deserve every bit of pain I can inflict them but it does not bode well fo rmy future in the intitution.  Any tips would be appreciated.

"My ADHD is co-morbid with Bipolar. I've found that 36 mg of Concerta is great for my concentration for the better part (~12 hours) of the day. However, it makes me extremely manic. My heart races, I can count my pulse by the feeling in my eyes sometimes (that wears off after 2-3 days but most times I don't take for that long because of the resulting mania), and I have racing thoughts if I'm not entirely devoted to a project, which can in turn lead me to stray from the project at hand (Wikipedia is a horrible/wonderful site).  Is there any non-stimulant medication I could talk to my doctor about? I've taken to drinking some mild coffee, which seems to help, but yellows my teeth and makes me irritable.

Specific Problem - I know what should be done (as many ADHD sufferers do) within the realm of romance but when it comes to output my brain just freezes up. I went 3 straight weekends in college with a different girl in my bed each weekend and failed to connect the dots that they wanted to hook up. I've had multiple chances to make something pop off but failed to make a move.

"I was just prescribed 20mg vyvanse xr/day but I'm not too sure how that dosage compares to other ADHD meds. I've tried adderall and dexedrine and for both of those I find 15-20mg is a good dose that will last all day without being too strong. But I've heard mixed things about vyvanse, some say that it's much weaker. Anyone have experience with trying different meds? I'm just wondering how the dosages and effects of vyvanse compare to other meds.   Also one more question, what are peoples' experiences drinking coffee with medication? I'm a regular coffee drinker, at least one in the morning then sometimes one or two throughout the day. But I feel like it might be a bit too much stimulation to drink it while on medication, especially since I'm normally a sweaty person. Should I try and cut down on coffee? Just stop drinking it altogether?  Edit: I should add the info I'm going off of is a friend who has the same prescription, he said that his 20mg of vyvanse has the effect of less than 10mg of adderall, but that seems wrong to me.

My issue is <e1>when I do not get enough sleep, the 20mg isn't enough to really keep me awake and alert, while 40mg is too much (it'll do the job, but I don't like the feeling)</e1>.

I always see people post about their ADHD and it seems so calm compared to what we see in my son. No one ever explains that they were like this or are like this.   When I say Tazmanian Devil, i really mean in. This kid is Jekyl and Hyde between on and off meds.

"I woke up scared, embarrassed and in a lot of pain, both physical and psychological.  I got in my car around 5pm, driving aimlessly around San Francisco, emotionally somewhere between depression and a blind rage.   I pulled the car over when I realized that my turns, which I thought were random, were slowly but steadily drawing me closer to the Golden Gate Bridge.   I called a family member. I got help. The years since have not been easy, but they have always been better. Three years ago, today.

"I live in California and I only got vaccinated yesterday (as did my fiance) after I got some potential exposure.  48 hrs after exposure I feel totally fine, but I can't stop worrying and <e1>I won't even kiss my fiance</e1>  because <e2>I'm afraid of getting him sick</e2> .  I feel like this is going to be like the 1918 pandemic and everyone is going to die.  I was prescribed preventative Tamiflu but <e3>I'm also going nuts with anxiety about potential side effects</e3>  since <e4>some people died after taking it</e4> - and now I'm worried my fiance and I will die because of the vaccine! (apparently that happened to someone in Utah)  Some of my symptoms may be psychosomatic.  I got the chills yesterday right after hearing about the flu outbreak in my area

"For the past 6 months, at my least stressful moments... I cant sleep. I have nothing keeping me up at night, nothing to worry about, nor anything exciting causing me to stay awake.  I am completely content and at peace and I have absolutely nothing to think about. l stay up the entire night just lying down my mind completely blank. It's xxausing problems with school

I was even more surprised when she told me she had it, and that she was happy with it. She was apparently diagnosed two years ago (at the age of fifty) and told me that <e5>going through the symptoms gave a lot of inner peace</e5> , because <e6>she finally realised where everything was coming from</e6> .

"For as long as I can remember I've been hearing about fantastic scientific and medical breakthroughs, either from magazines or the internet. It used to make me so excited and hopeful, but now that I have a sister with two kids, dieing of cancer, I can't help feeling like none of this crap ever amounts to anything. If you subscribe to r/science you hear about this stuff every other day, how scientists have taken another giant step (out of hundreds or thousands) toward curing cancer. All I can think is, great, when will that reach my sister? When will that come within a hair's breath of being applied science in hospitals?   As far as I can tell there hasn't been a major change in how cancer patients are treated in over five years. Makes me kind of sick to hear people being so optimistic. That's the worst example of course. There's also the fact I still don't have my hover-car or space hotel or vaccine injections that don't hurt and a whole bunch of other crap I was promised over ten years ago.

"I feel like sometimes I'm doing ok and getting through this. A couple of days this week I've been as happy as I've been in a long time.   But I feel like its not happening quickly enough. I know that its never going to happen overnight. But I mean I think I'm running out of time. I am running out of whatever it was that made it possible for me to keep on going and I'm coming to a deadline where somethings going to snap in me and I'm going to do something or something is going to happen.  Edit; missing words.

"threw out the large butts w/H2O and am ready for it.  I'm old, a grandma and I lie about smoking.  That means I have a serious problem.  See, I'm not a liar and that more than anything pains me.  I've thought that maybe I'll try going outside and walking when the urges come on strong.  I'm crippled, it's raining and cold but I can't think of what else to do to distract me long enough to get thru those moments of cravings.  Saw this sub.  I'm ready kind supporters.  Ready

"I'm 22 soon turning 23. Just kissed a girl once in my life still a virgin. I don't know what's wrong with me, why did I never had a girlfriend although I tried it many many times. With every rejection I get i feel worse and I'm not sure if I will ever find a girlfriend. There is no point in living this life any longer. I'm depressed and just can't take the loneliness any longer it is so painful. I whish I would just die.

"<e1>I was diagnosed with panic disorder in November 2013</e1>  after experiencing 6 panic attacks in 2 days.  <e2>That pushed me over the edge and made me finally call a psychiatrist</e2> .  I go to talk therapy every 2 weeks and am on meds, to include Xanax for emergencies.  This is still fairly new to me, I used to be calm and stress free and could handle anything.  Then all of a sudden this panic and anxiety took over my life.  <e3>I work from home</e3>  so <e4>I have barely any social interaction beyond my kids activities</e4> .  <e5>Sometimes I can't even go shopping</e5>  because <e6>thinking about it gives me anxiety</e6> .  I feel better if my husband or kids go with me - but not always.  <e7>I had a panic attack</e7>  yesterday because <e8>my daughter came home from school in tears</e8>  because <e9>she had a bad day<e9>.  This is ridiculous!  How do you manage work and home and social situations when everything causes a panic attack?  Any suggestions would be helpful.

"I start second semester of college Monday. My ex left me near the end of September after 15 months. She doesn't go to college, but my old friend(we aren't friend anymore) I assume talks to her a lot from what I've heard. The constant fear I have is him being in one of my classes this semester. The only thing with that is the fact that my Eng class filled up the day I signed up for it and my medical term class I doubt he would take. He won't be in my precal or my computer science class, but I don't know why I'm worrying so much. I don't even know how to deal with it. The constant depression I suffer and suicidal thoughts don't help on the slightest. Anyone have any tips?

"After doing a lot of research, I discovered that this beta blocker is sometimes used off-label for anxiety.  I talked my shrink into prescribing it to me yesterday, and I'm curious if it's helped anyone here.   I just started on a low dose today (10mg). It didn't seem to do much.
