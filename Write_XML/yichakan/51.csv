When I am done conversing with someone I run through the last few text messages over and over again in my head to make sure I didn't say anything that would have caused them to stop replying. 3.

I have no aspirations or vision for how I want my life to turn out.   I'm late to sleep and late to rise. I'm not immersing myself with my friends anymore. Some days I just don't want to get out of bed. I feel so heavy. When I try and lift my arms it's like I have 20 pound weights on them. I get so hungry but I don't want to eat. I get so tired but I don't want to sleep. Everything either saddens me or angers me, but every day I feel more numb. I want to tell people about this, but I'm scared of rejection and judgement. I'm afraid I might be faking it, too. Just putting up a show for attention. Some days I just think about turning the whole thing off. Those days are getting more frequent and those thoughts are getting louder.

I work hard, I mother hard, I do so much every day, and then in the evening, don't I deserve to be imperfect!? If I could just learn how not to drink to oblivion......I am totally rambling, don't mind me, I just would rather write here and see how irrational I am than to keep twirling the urge around in my head. I still haven't gotten to the point where sobriety feels like a gift to me. It still feels like an unfair burden and on the inside I am stomping my feet like a toddler. Thank you all on this forum for being there.

"I mean isn't it enough to just settle down get an okay paying job and play some motherfucking video games. Will other hobbies like cooking  and reading   and all that bullshit really give me the same happiness. I mean at the end of the day what's more important being respected or just being yourself and doing what you love? I'm fine with being  what society deems a loser, I don't know why other people don't feel the same.

"Just a few evening thoughts over the past days.  Honestly I do miss coming home and being able to crack a few beers on the porch or going camping and having a few swigs of whiskey with the boys.  But you know it's alright not to.  I sit on my porch and drink lemonade and I went camping and made some awesome tea.  No hangovers, no regrets, completely clear headed and feeling good.  I'm just doing a bit of reflecting and yes I do sometimes miss it but all the junk that came with it I am so much more better off.  My health has improved, I'm much more in shape, I have friends again, money looking good, and I am much more optimistic about the future.  I just know though how incredibly sneaky alcohol is, lurking in the background just waiting for that one opportunity to strike.  I'm watchin out though, very carefully.    Just wanted to say everyone on stopdrinking has helped me out a great deal with my sobriety.  It's a wonderful resource.  Thanks! and thanks for reading!

"When people talk about depression they often say that things will get better. Well <e1>it's been 6 years. I still want to kill myself</e1>. I've been to multiple therapists, taken multiple drugs, I've tried every thing. And I think <e2>I've finally concluded that it will never change</e2>. I will always look down at myself, I will always see myself as ugly, I will always hate who I am as a person. I don't think that will ever change. So suicide just seems like the best option. Everyone will be better for it

"I keep having a reoccurring feeling that something bad happened to me during my childhood.   * I have always had detailed, strange, anxious nightmares * I sometimes resent my mother even though I know she loves me. She has some issues but she is a good, loving mom.  * I feel like I don't remember part of my childhood, but I think thats normal..?  * I always over think, I might be overthinking this..  * I sometimes just feel *off*. I know that is the depression.   Should I ask my parents? I'm really close with them, especially my dad. If something did happen to me, <e1>I want to say that I think I'm ready to accept it and that whatever happened is in the past.</e1> <e2>I am really actually proud of who I am</e2>.

It's the same bloody drug. Has anyone had this happen?  I like sleep and all but I still need to go to work and do things.

Think of the healthy lifestyle kids who have never had sugar at their first party with red cordial and lollies unsupervised.  I have never seen these kids so giggling and hyper in my life. Sleep for them and us were out of the question. Took probably 6 hours or more for them to calm down let alone goto sleep.  So as I asked above has anyone noticed a link or is it just my wacky kids

"Hey all, I'm 23, been smoking since about 19 almost daily. My friend group slowly morphed into smokers and my roommates smoke daily. I didn't think I would be able to turn my back on a good time smoking with my roommates esp after a hard day's work. But I finally learned I was going to keep feeling guilty all day at work until I could smoke again at night. Counseling and running has helped too but thanks to all of you for sharing your stories of turning your back on it for a greater good. I probably would have given up last night if not for everyone that shared stories so similar to mine.

"So I was recently prescribed Ritalin SR and have been taking 10mg two times each day. I wasn't feeling any beneficial changes. What I did feel was some drowsiness/sluggishness and an increased appetite which seemed weird to me.  Today however was different. I took my medication as usual (at 7am) and headed to school. While studying during my free time I felt somewhat lightheaded, began breathing heavily, felt a rapid heartbeat and had unusually shaky hands. I've had issues with anxiety in the past and I did have a test coming up soon, but this was the first time I felt such intense anxiety. My mind was racing (more than usual) and I simply couldn't concentrate.  <e1>This was pretty frustrating</e1> because <e2>it somewhat affected my work throughout the day</e2>. I was constantly pausing and trying to calm myself down in order to work but it barely helped. The anxiety eventually subsided at about 12.  Does anyone have advice or information about this? How has Ritalin SR affected you?  **TL;DR: Had increased anxiety today after taking Ritalin SR for two weeks and not experiencing any significant changes**
