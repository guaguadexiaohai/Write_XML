As a part of my sobriety I decided I would try to learn more about myself and I started reading Sam Harris' waking up...which I really enjoyed (i'm not one for spiritualist mumbo jumbo bullshit, and it definitely isn't) and I would highly recommend it to anyone going sober.  It doesn't really deal with addiction but it deals heavily with rethinking yourself and methods for changing how you see the world, and all without the metaphysical claims to impossible knowledge.  side note: to anyone doing AA, awesome, keep plugging...I wasn't insulting, AA just never worked for me...my religious hate boner is too strong.

"I've never been the most attentive person in the world. According to my friend, I'm a person that follows whatever I deem interesting."" This leads my attention out of situations that I am currently engaged in. I sometimes completely miss what people are saying in a conversation due to my misguided attention. I also tend to repeat stories and bits of information quite frequently. I gert very excited about particular things and have a compulsion to tell people. I am later reminded by people that I've told them X number of times before. Study and Work wise it is nearly impossible for me to sit and read most assignments or sit and complete assignments without getting up several times in 2 hours for a 20 minute lap to see who and what else is in the library.It's been like this since I was in elementary school. A teacher once told my mother that I needed to be evaluated and she took it as a personal insult and an insult to me. She also told me to never engage people who think I have this problem.

Around lunch time (1-2pm) I sometimes get very cold hands and feet and around 4pm I become very very tired and almost always take a nap.  Are these side effects normal or should I try something else.

After around 11 am I begin to feel slightly anxious and lethargic; redosing helps manage ADHD symptoms, but with the added bonus of anxiety - even a lower effective dosage has shown similar effects. I make sure to eat well and stay hydrated. Aside from the crash, Ritalin has improved the quality of my life. I have another appointment in about three weeks and I'll inquire about other medications; I've read that dexmethylphenidate aka Focalin is a cleaner, smoother version of Ritalin. Concerta may also lessen the negative effects by providing a steady stream. Or perhaps methylphenidate may not be the right stimulant for me. In the meantime, I've found that even 15-20 minutes of high intensity cardiovascular exercise drastically reduces the negative side effects of methylphenidate.

Getting frustrated for me leads to me quitting things when they get difficult, and has held me back for a lot of my life. Right now I'm trying to learn JavaScript for web design, but I've hit a roadblock. I *really* want to quit and move onto something else, but I'd rather find a better coping mechanism for frustration than quitting. What makes things worse is that when I'm frustrated, it takes very little for me to get angry, and I can wind up being very cranky with my wife and kids. Ugh. Also, if I go on meds for ADHD will they help with my frustration?

Between Adderall and Strattera (the options available to me through insurance), I opted for the latter as the crash didn't sound so appealing, my appetite isn't great and my metabolism is high as it stands. What I failed to learn before I accepted it, however, is that Strattera is associated with ED and a general loss of libido. Now, I'm an artist, and a lot of my inspiration for my drawings and paintings comes from... well, my sexuality. My intent in taking this medication is to improve my general quality of life, including my ability to concentrate myself and effectually improve in my passion. But between art and sex, I'm terrified that Strattera will do me more harm than good and destroy a big part of what makes me... me. I suppose this is really just an anxious rant and it's still worth trying to see how it affects me, and worse case scenario I can just discontinue the medication and try Adderall when I see my psychiatrist again. Anyways, has anyone successfully used Strattera and not taken a hit to their sex drive?

At first 10mg never lasted the full 8 hours like it was supposed to. I always felt I was coming down around 5-6 hours after taking it. Now when I take it I feel like it only lasts 3-4 hours if I'm lucky.  I'm concerned that I'm becoming used to the symptoms, so if I feel that I can eat while on it and when I lose the feeling of euphoria I just assume it's no longer working.

Everything I've read about people switching meds is the other way around: from Adderall to Vyvanse. Typically the reactions to this switch are positive and somehow, it is psyching me out. After hearing about the side effects and the crashes, I've developed a generally negative view on Adderall (as opposed to Vyvanse) and I'm legitimately scared to get on Adderall. I know everyone reacts to certain medications differently, but if possible, could anyone offer some personal anecdotes or words of advice?

Obviously for me it's normal but I now am very conscious of how much noise is going on in there, conversations, bits of songs on constant repeat - CONSTANT repeat, more conversations, what was that sound....etc etc.. Now that I am conscious of it, I want quiet. Just a little bit.  I guess my question is, does anyone else deal with this and if so do you have any strategies that have worked for you to get some peace and quiet? I do know working allows me some peace, but it's more of a major distraction that requires serious focus but not silence.

I asked if there was apple cider, but the host looked at me like I was crazy to ask for some non alcoholic bubbly. She did say there was lemonade so I had that instead. Had sooo much fun with everyone! It dawned on me this morning that old Katie would've been completely stressed the entire time being the only person (besides the pregnant person) who wasn't drinking alcohol. Instead, I didn't think much of it at all. Point of my post is, it's truly amazing to realize there comes a point where sobriety is just normal. It kind of becomes the same concept as a disliked food. For example, I hate corn, and if it's offered at a potluck or party, I'll just eat another option. This is the same concept I've found myself using when abstaining from alcohol. Just wanted to also say happy Monday and stay motivated today! :)

I've tried varying doses of vyvanse over the last few weeks. 20mg basically does nothing, 40mg I can feel but it doesn't help as much as I'd like, or in the way I'd like, and hen I tried 60mg and got some side effects from that, so now I've dropped it back to 40mg till I go to my docs.

If it is boring, then I will have no choice but to switch to something fun -- *if I want to keep my sanity* --  however, in hindsight, my brain knows that it's bad to waste time, but I just cannot force myself to do the boring stuff.

Has anyone of you tried to smoke less this way or will the cravings always stay the same (like with Alcoholics) if you dont stop smoking 100% from one day to the other.TL;DR: is it possible for a heavy smoker to become a occasional smoker by slowly breaking habits?

My whole area down there just does not response to touch the same at all and I can't get much pleasure out of it.My question is: can anxiety affect you to the point where you seem to feel okay enough to do something but you're actually still anxious about it? Could anxiety be affecting the way touch feels and how good it feels...?? I've been freaking over this.

I have tried to help them before, and I think I've helped a little in delaying it and making them feel better.They say that their life is worthless and that the world would be better if they had never been born. They have set a date to kill them self. I tried reporting them to an anti-suicide organization once, but they said that unless my friend contacted them and wanted help, they couldn't do anything.I think that they are extremely serious and I don't want to risk anything.I have literally been trying everything I can think of for years to cheer my friend up. I am out of ideas and words to say and it appears nothing I do will make them feel better. I have no idea where they live and they won't tell me, but I know it's far away from here.Is there any advice?

"I was just diagnosed with ADHD combined type at age 27 and I'm having a real struggle to work through this. I thought it would feel like I got some answers, but instead I am feeling depressed I had to go through life for so long without any acceptance from others and having to feel different without understanding why. I thought I was going to get the predominantly inattentive type and so it was a little shock to get the combined type. I basically wanna know if any of you had a hard time reacting to your diagnosis or if it was just a relief. I also wanna hear about where you are in life now after you know about your ADHD. I feel like I'm never going to keep a job or get to work with what I love.

He seems very set on sobriety right now. up until tonight, he's been very quiet, depressed, and tense when I've talked to him on the phone. honestly I don't blame him. when he was admitted they took away his 3 vices, caffeine(pop/soda), alcohol, and cigarettes. but tonight I heard a glimmer of hope in his tone. he was laughing and joking around with me. and seemed a bit happier. I am SO proud of him, and I tell him every time I talk to him. he's probably got a couple more days in rehab, but it looks like his levels are normal and he's basically done detoxing. right now they are more concerned with his high blood pressure.If anyone has any suggestions on how I can keep encouraging him and help him with keeping sober after he's out of rehab and going to outpatient treatments, I would greatly appreciate it.

"So my doctor recently diagnosed me with depression. I was supposed to see a councillor though the charity that ran it went bump. So I'm likely going to be sent to a psychologist or another kind of councillor. My question is I guess, does it really work? I mean I assume so, otherwise councillors wouldn't exist. But I'm extremely cynical, I find it hard to trust people and such, and I'm just worried I'm going to waste mine and the councillors time.

"I used to get depressed more than half a year ago but it went, and I honestly thought I was getting better. Now I've moved back to uni it's come back, and I hate it. I don't want to get out of bed or do the most basic chore. My anxiety is bad as well, I always feel like people are looking at me, judging me. I've started drinking a lot of alcohol and now I can't seem to stop myself. I keep dreaming that I kill myself, and it's beginning to scare me. I don't know what to do, I really don't want to go to the doctors or anything. I just get so lonely... Anyone know any coping mechanisms that doesn't involve alcohol ?

"Maybe my sadness won't ever change. I have fun here and there, get sad, irritated, furious sometimes. But things are alright. This march I was certain I was going to kill myself. Few months after pleading restlessly for reasons to live and after many anxiety attacks, I stumbled upon knowledge about health and fitness here on Reddit. Since then I've put a lot of effort into losing weight and have lost 27lbs so far. Probably my only accomplishment of this treacherous year... but I'm satisfied that I've done something for myself. I guess you can say that I now have hope that things can get better. Too many times I've said \fuck it\"" and neglected my health

"whenever I visit this sub, I'm almost moved to tears by the experiences of some of you...growing up, and at the peak of my anxiety, I always felt that I was the ONLY person in the entire world that ever felt this way.<e1>I'm just so glad that everyone on here, myself included, knows that isn't true.

"So it is genraly a dog big and scary looking I feel like it will be in my kitchen or elsewhere in the house. Logically I know nothing could get in the house without at least makeing a noise but I just feel like this thing from my head will be somewhere. I just want to be able to not be scared for once in my life at the moment it is just at night but I'm worried it is going to get worse.

"I hope this is the right subreddit for this.My mum has always been hopeless with computers and tech. Just recently she told me that she gets shaky/sweaty and internally panicked when trying to do something new related to tech/computers. That sounded to me like (the very little I know about) anxiety.She is taking an iPad/Phone course to learn how to use my old iPhone I am giving her.Does anyone have any tips for helping her deal with any anxiety she ends up with during the class? I'm not planning on being there as I have a busy weekend but I'm thinking of it if I can make it.I'm not sure if it would make any difference to any answers I receive but there is roughly a 100% chance she has never been to any sort of counseling about this nor seen any sort of medical professional about it so she has no coping strategies beyond just blocking everything out when she gets panicked/anxious.Can anyone help me help my mum? (For what it's worth - I'm in my 20s and she is in her 60s and lives alone)

"To be clear I take my medication regularly, but sometimes I don't always want to be on medication.<e1>Either I'll take a day off, or just take it on and off for a few days</e1> because <e2>I don't need it</e2>. My question is how bad is it for you to take Adderall, or any ADD stimulant medication on and off? Specifically on your brain, I can only assume dopamine levels etc being so inconsistent can't be good. Also does anyone know of any websites where there's more information about this? I feel like there's isn't the best information about ADD meds out there already, but lately I've been curious on what it does to your brain when taken inconsistently.
