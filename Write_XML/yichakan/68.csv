"So my husband has PTSD. His event occurred when he was 17, went undiagnosed for approximately 9 years, he went through 1.5 years of intense CBT and then was discharged from outpatients care.Fast forward to now, we're approximately 5 years after that. The last 5 years have had ups and downs, but he's miles better than he was before CBT ... until the beginning of this year. He started to deteriorate. Now, in August, I can see a ton of the old PTSD symptoms - hyper alert, nightmares night terrors, inability or unwillingness to sleep, struggling with feeling overwhelmed all the time, inability to think through things that require sustained mental thought.The only thing that's different is that it's not about his traumatic event? He's not suffering or struggling thinking about his traumatic event, that was all dealt with and he swears it's not something he's worried about now. Is this still a relapse? Or is this something else? How can I tell? What should I be looking for? How can I help him (aside from getting him back to a therapist that specializes in PTSD and CBT)?

"Long story short: Tylenol #3 (Codeine-Apap 30-300) habit for 2 years I'd estimate... Stopped Friday night and I'm quite concerned I won't make it past the drug screening for Tuesday. I'm applying for maintenance at a school district and leaving (hopefully) my job as a pharmacy technician (I'm sure you see why my current job conflicts with my goals).Withdrawal symptoms are mostly manageable. There's a few things I'm having trouble (and have had trouble in the past) coping with. Joint/back pain: APAP and NSAIDs really don't seem to help. Exercise helps in that moment, and then I lay awake all night wondering why I did that to myself. Headache: APAP seems to help, but not long enough.Obviously my main concern is just passing the screening. Most websites claim codeine becomes undetectable to drug screening in about 72 hours. Does anyone have experience with this?

Then bring to your mind both points of time: that in which you will enjoy the pleasure, and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself after you have enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will be glad and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticing, and agreeable and attractive force may not subdue you; but set in opposition to this how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a victory.\n\nArticle 34 of the [Enchiridion](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html)

They are more focused on themselves. It's been said many times before but destroy your comfort zone and don't look back. I still have a lot to learn but I've been really looking at advice online (LAWHF, rsdtyler) and using that to my advantage. But I find that talking louder definitely makes me feel more confident and happy in a way.

If you have a strong mind and a still objective to quit smoking <e1>because you have internalized how bad and useless is smoking</e1>, <e2>99% you can do it</e2>. But the real thing is, you have to internalize it,be  aware and conscious of such thing, that smoking is nothing good, it harms your body and stresses you more than not smoking. Once you achieve a still and calm state of mind wrt cigarettes, every craving you will have, it will be defeatable.\n\nOh and yes, exercise regularly to push your body to eliminate shit from lungs is a thing that I've found it can maintain you focused. Seeing that you are expelling catarrh and other shit is a great motivator to continue to stay clean. \n\nAfter nearly 3 months cravings are near absent and when they come, they come and go in a matter of 30 seconds.\nSorry for the wall of text!\n\nTL;DR: your mind can do wonders. stop smoking!

I legitimately cannot sleep unless I am sharing a bed with someone, if I do have to sleep alone its a restless sleep and I have to keep all the lights on and have the TV on until I fall asleep (usually 2-3 hrs of just laying in bed). \n\nI recently moved about an hour and a half away from my city with my boyfriend for his work. This is the first time I've ever really had to face being completely ALONE. On days he works and I am off I find myself feeling uneasy and almost manic. I'll bounce around feeling hopeless and scared to feeling sexy and beautiful. I find myself experiencing mood swings way more drastically than I ever had before. Do any of you experience this?

"Ive been having issues with depression kind of stuff lately. No motivation, frustrated, kind of void of emotion. Im trying to get out of it, but whats really not helping is that i cant sleep. The second i lay down i get paranoia, yelling voices and racing thoughts. I wont fall asleep until like 8 am. Then i wake up at like 4 pm. Its awful.

"I was in and out of therapy from the age of 11-19. I experienced truly awful authority figures, teachers and nurses alike.

Neglect and emotional abuse and eventual abandonment from my mother. The murder of my father, the sexual assault by an ex boyfriend when i was a child. It accumulated all together and at 15 I moved into my uncles care. But by that point I was a paranoid cynical mess. I believed everyone had an ulterior motive, that nobody cared for anyone without a good reason. I fully believed any nice thing said or done for me was a ploy for something. I didn't think i was worthy of anything. I isolated myself massively to avoid losing anymore people. At 16 I met dr \S\""\n\nDr S was the most bubbly person I had ever met. Funny
