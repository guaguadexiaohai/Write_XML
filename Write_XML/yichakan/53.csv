Currently on:\n \nLamotrigine 150mg\n \nSeroquel 400mg\n \nLexapro 20mg\n\nThe Seroquel effects for sleep have been wearing off. She gave me Hydroxyzine 50mg on top of Seroquel. It's working but I'm worried I'll become tolerant to that too.\n \nMight ask to up the Lamotrigine for depression as well.\n \nShe also said 400mg is the max for Seroquel for bipolar and doesn't want to go any higher.

"So I successfully quit playing League of Legends 402 days ago. Over the last year that I haven't been playing, I've progressed immeasurably from where I was; however after the end of exams a month and a half ago, as a reward to myself and to see if I am able to play casually, I've slowly started playing single player games with my housemates. Over the last fortnight it has progressed to reinstalling mobile games on my phone, and finally, I'm ashamed to say, I played a few games of league again. \n\nThe final straw was today when I spent probably 6 hours playing [Out There](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miclos.google.games.outthere&amp;hl=en).

"For instance, when I'm out in public, I don't like strangers coming very close to me. It's not that I'm scared of them, it's just social anxiety. I have a larger than average personal bubble. This especially applies if I'm out taking a walk, then I really feel anxious about social interaction more than any other time. My social anxiety is by far at its worst when I'm alone. If I'm with someone I know, 1) they can break the ice in a social interaction 2) they can reassure me if I feel like I embarrassed myself even if I actually didn't.

"Hey team,\nHad my last drink on Thursday, it's Sunday night now, about to go to sleep. Today I went to a movie with my partner and then he wanted to go to a bar after, so I went and got a nice ginger ale, and yet I found myself feeling guilty for having a sugary drink that I wouldn't ever allow myself to have, even though I would happily put away a bottle of wine.\n\n Then later in the man bought a 6 pack of beer (but<e1> has only had 2</e1>, because<e2> he isn't me</e2>) and so I had a bit of sorbet after dinner as my treat. Again, food guilt! I realised I've naturally been strictly monitoring my food for a couple of years now to try to control my weight with all my wine intake. I wouldn't ever dream of drinking juice, or eating an icecream etc\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?

I had been getting maybe two hours of sleep a night for two weeks. I ended up going to urgent care and they prescribed (generic) Xanax.

I couldn't go a couple sentences without messing up. I stopped taking the Xanax about two months ago but I am still not speaking correctly. Has anybody else had this problem? If so, is there any way to FIX it? It's so embarrassing and it ends up making me more anxious.

Characteristics of a good course could include instant feedback, lots of interactivity (e.g. quizzes, short assignments), lectures/notes broken down into short topics, course available 'on-demand', active discussions boards and so on.  \n\nAs an example, I found [MITx's Intro to Computer Science](\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-8) quite good. The lecture videos are split up so each topic is covered in less than 20 mins (making it easy to focus on when first learning and easy to go back and reference later). There was also lots of mini quizzes and assignments. The only downside is that the material was released week by week - I would have a ton of motivation, do four weeks then run out of assignments/lectures then wait a month until doing another couple of weeks all at once (instead of working through it week by week like you're suppose to).  \n

I don't suffer from anxiety every day but when I do have it, here is what happens: one day I will wake up with bad anxiety that does not go away unless I cry it out or take clonazepam. Then for at least 4 days afterwards I feel equally bad depression. The depression slowly day by day gets better until I feel normal again. Sometimes there's tiny bouts of anxiety in there. The only thing that makes any of this bearable to me is the knowledge that odds are I will feel better again after a week or so. Does anyone else feel just completely drained of neuro chemicals for a few days after an anxiety attack?

The other night my boyfriend was showing me a video in fb of a 14 year old trans girl and ever since I have been questioning myself and it is giving me really bad andiety. I have always loved being s girl and NEVER questioned it. All of my friends are girls, I've always pictured myself being a wife and mother. And now this is making it hard to do so. It's even making me feel like I'm drifting away from my boyfriend bc it's all I can think of. I just want to be the happy me I was before any of this:( I feel like I don't even know myself anymore and I will be devastated if this isn't just my OCD. It can seem so real and as if it's what I want but then I'm happy with my life as a woman and want to stay this way just scared im in denial that I would be happier as a man... Opinions?

"I thought the feeling of euphoria, very commom to those who use ADHD med for the first time, was supposed to no longer exist after a few days? \n\nI know my dose is quite high (70 mg of Vyvanse), and maybe that is I still get that euphoria feeling - which basically means I want to talk to everyone and do everything I possibly CAN'T for at least 30 minutes while it lasts. Once the feeling wears off, I sort of feel regret that I decided 30 minutes ago talk to someone (which is usually not me when I'm not on meds or when the euphoria wears off).\n\nIs it normal? After months of CBT, thankfully I decided not to give a crap of what I do when I'm euphoric.

This new app is based on exposure therapy, one of the most effective behavioral techniques for overcoming social anxiety. \n\nLots of people may have told you to go and face your fears, but that often does not work. This app helps you create a fear hierarchy - where you ranked your feared situations from least to most scary. Then, you start at the bottom of the fear hierarchy and make your way up. Another common mistake is to leave while your body is still in a state of anxiety. To help you complete the feared activities, this app has an interactive module that guides you through the activity and ensures that you stay there until your anxiety dies down (as it inevitably will). \n\nLet me know what you think and if you have any questions I will be happy to answer them in the comments. Good luck!
