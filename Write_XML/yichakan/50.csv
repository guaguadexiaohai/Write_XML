I'm not really suicidal (as in wanting to kill myself) at the moment, and even if I were, for better or worse, I'm currently too much of a coward to do that sort of thing in the near future.

That's what started it all. She said this morning that she is tired of me judging her for drinking. I don't of course, but she refuses to believe that. She thinks that I don't have a good time when we go out and that I look down on everyone who is drinking. I've tried explaining that being at a bar is uncomfortable for me and that its hard to keep up with mood of people who drink. She doesn't seem to understand that I quit because I have a problem and that being around that much alcohol and in that kind of atmosphere is very difficult for me.The worst part.

I had anger issues when I would become blackout drunk, and not really remembering it, just having to be told about it next day. I've always been a pretty mellow person sober, and I didn't always become angry when drinking, only sometimes. But I've found that I have a much shorter fuse regarding things that aren't even a big deal after I calm down and reflect on the situation. My questions are, is this common? And will it lessen over time? I don't like being quick to anger. Is there possibly a medication to help with something like this? Currently I am on 50mg a day of sertraline (zoloft) but I don't think it has really helped anything. Thanks!

I'm buoyed by the novelty of not smoking and the speed at which life seems to improve. The memories of how much I hated smoking are still fresh in my mind. But at this stage, it's always tempting to have a big hedonistic blow out  night where I get wasted and buy a packet of cigs. I tell myself it's so easy and enjoyable to stop smoking that I can start again for a bit and I'll just stop again.

Just about everyone says they know full-well their fears are unfounded.<e1>This matches my own experience</e1>, so <e2>I'll toss the question out</e2>: If we know our fears are unfounded, then what are we really afraid of?Thinking about this myself, I've come to realize it's generally not the thing itself (flying, driving, social situations) I'm uncomfortable with. It's the fear that I'll suddenly find myself experiencing fear, and be judged for that fear.It's the fear of having to try and explain my irrational fears.Put another way, if we were living in a world where it was totally normal to suddenly have a panic attack on an airplane -- like 7 out of 10 people did it, and no one even took notice of it anymore -- then I seriously think knowing I wouldn't be scrutinized would allay 90% of the anxiety I faced.It seems it's not fear of an irrational thing. It's fear of being scrutinized for fear of an irrational thing.Can anyone relate to this? Or would I be overgeneralizing to say that this may be at the heart of anxiety?

"I was prescribed Concerta today. Dr. wants to start me on 18 mgday for a week, increasing by 18 mgday each week until I'm taking 72 mgday during the fourth week.However, he wrote a prescription for 70 18 mg pills (enough to cover exactly four weeks). The insurance company wasn't thrilled about that number of pills on one prescription, but after multiple calls from the Dr. they consented. What I wasn't anticipating was the cost: over $500, and this is the generic. My guess is that I'm paying just as much per 18 mg pill as I'd be paying per 54 mg pill (or per 72 mg pill if they make those). Is that true? Or is $500+month the actual cost?

"I am a good student and generally a good person. I don't always listen to my mom but I try to. A few days ago, <e1>I was texting a friend. And I am very ashamed</e1> because of <e2>the dirty things we were talking about</e2>. We were not talking about nice things, but very nasty and pervy things that I am not proud of nor do I want to share. Well, today <e3>my mom randomly took my phone and read through all the messages</e3>. Now I am in huge trouble and she is going to talk to my friends parents( I am not sure if she is bluffing or not but I am scared). And she said <e4>she is very ashamed of me and thinks its her fault that I said those dirty things</e4>. Now <e5>I am too ashamed to look at her. I just made myself pass out in my room</e5>. <e6>I do not feel like living anymore</e6>. I just do not know what to do anymore.

"Right now, I'm not particularly depressed, but it's a problem I've had for about five years. People tell me it'll get better. It does but never for very long. I'm 18 and have my life ahead of me. It's scary. I have to be alive for such a long time, and I don't know if I'll ever be happy during it. I feel pleasure at times. Sometimes contentedness or sublimity. That's it. I don't think I've been 'happy' since I was a child. Even when I'm not depressed, I don't feel good. Just ok... I'm such a miserable asshole, and as boring as depression is, time just flies by. I'm wasting my life away in depression. I'll be dead sometime in the relatively near future and my life's going to be spent being miserable.  Any advice on how to get better so this doesn't happen? How can I make use of my time and not be so unhappy?

"I can't stand this.  I returned her call in the middle of the work day, a time when I'm usually bored and getting tired. I guess that was evident in my voice, and it apparently was a huge indication that I'm ungrateful and spoiled. Growing up, if I had the wrong tone or made the wrong facial expression (you know, the thing you can't control), I usually got an interrogation and lecture after. She asks me what's wrong, and why am I talking like that. I never understood why she's so hostile over nothing. Is there any wonder why I'm a timid adult who says i'm sorry"" way too much?DAE go through this? ""

"Just got perscribed some and I am feeling hopeful this might be the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm mostly stable with one downer period of about a month a year. So I am kinda hoping this will help make me more functional during the bad periods. But I want to hear some stories from people who have tried it and if it worked for you or not. Or what your personal experience using them was?
