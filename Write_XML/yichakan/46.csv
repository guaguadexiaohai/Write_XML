"I've had anxiety for a long time, with depression creeping in whenever things get to be too much. Today, I had a very stressful meeting with my research mentor which upended a lot of the work I've been doing for the past year. This sent me into a stressed mood which itself is manageable enough. However, I've noticed that when I do get stressed or anxious or overwhelmed I get a kind of troubling thought. I don't get the urge to kill myself or harm myself directly, but I get into a state where I feel oddly okay about something bad happening to me. For example, after the meeting I was walking by a construction site and I had thoughts like \If that crane crushed me I wouldn't have to worry about this.\"" Generally I'll tend to think of catastrophes and being harmed by other things when I'm anxious or depressed. \n\nI feel like I'm healthy overall

Here are a few new things that have reared their ugly head since I quit drinking 11 days ago:\n\n* I used to only dabble with smokeless tobacco (Copenhagen).  I went through an entire can yesterday.\n* Needless spending\n* Eating food (junk) that I would normally be able to resist\n\nI'm sure this is a common occurrence.  It's almost like I'm trying to fill the hole where my drinking (which I thoroughly enjoyed) used to be...  like I'm trying to comfort myself.  At this point it would almost be better and cheaper for me to just drink.  Don't worry, I'm not going back.  I was just wondering if any of you experienced the same thing and might have some advice other than good ole willpower for me.\n\n\nThanks!

"So I'm a 19 year old guy in university, I usually drink once every week or two with friends. When I drink, I'm typically fairly tame.. I never really make that much of an ass out of myself.\n\nBut afterwards, I just feel so ashamed and depressed. It lasts for days at a time sometimes.\n\nAnd if I make one little mistake, or when I look back at something and can think of a way I could have handled it better, I'm literally disgusted in myself.\n\nLike I said, I'm not the one to get drunk and make a scene, get violent, or anything like that. Even when I blackout, worst I'll do is be a bit more social than normal, openly sing along to music, and allow my friends to take pictures with me.\n\nI don't think alcohol is the problem, but I don't know.
