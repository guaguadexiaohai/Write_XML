Although It isn't completely surprising considering I always had to take remedial classes throughout my school days.

Do any of you guys go from furious to self loathing to thinking everyone is below you in a sort of cycle? That happened to me; I insulted him, along with two of our mutual friends, calling out their insecurities and even talking rudely about those they care about. The thing is, it felt really good at the time and I felt that they were deserving and so obviously beneath me.

"Was recently prescribed low dose diazepam to use PRN for my GAD.

Fully appreciate the abuse, dependence and withdrawal potential too (being a pharmacology student). \n\nSince taking between 5-10mg of diazepam daily has been quite sedating and has seemed to be associated with memory loss of what I've done the past few days, I've read that low dose klonopin is a better alternative which is less sedating and fewer reports of mental 'decline'. Can anybody vouch for this, or give their experience comparing the two?\n\nI don't want to get high, or take it recreationally. I am aware of tolerance, but I've also seen reports that taking a low-dose as prescribed daily maintains the anxiolytic effects and is suitable to treat GAD, especially klonopin.\nThanks a lot.

Usually the things they say aren't things that help but rather they say things that make it sound like my obsessive thought is going to come true. My compulsions aren't clear but usually it's full scale panic mode with tons of anxiety and tunnel vision, trying my hardest to stop whatever event from happening while also trying my hardest to maintain my composure. Has anyone else experienced this and maybe could give me a few tips on how to manage it?\n\n\nEdit: I'm on 1 MG Risperidone and 100 MG SR Bupropion. I didn't take my Risperidone the day before this happened because I was running out and I needed to save 1 for work before I got more. Events like these happen with less intensity when I'm taking Risperidone like I should but I'm still curious, why does this happen? How can I manage it?

And right around that time, the symptoms just... Stopped. \n\nThe past few months, I have dealt with a laundry list of triggers. High stress (being homeless is stressful), long work hours, lack of sleep, lack of food, strained relationships/loneliness, drinking too much, and my absolute worst trigger - cash in hand after being broke. (It triggers mania like nothing else and I don't know why.) \n\nAnd yet, I'm more stable and lucid than I have been in years, meds or not.

I was pretty dazed and confused for a while, and actually hit myself in the head during that period(I'm guessing a combo of my being on the autism spectrum and still being halfway in a flashback?).\n\nThat's obviously not really healthy for me, and I was wondering if anyone has experienced similar difficulties calming down after nightmares?  What do you do to help get past them?

It is a feeling that you are in physical danger, etc...\n\nContinue to break these things down until you realize that they are just ideas and they cannot hurt you if you don't let them. you can do this with anything from what are relationships to what is the meaning of my life.

I haven't had any Kratom in 24 hours and I am a stay at home mom that will have kids all week when things get bad with no help.. So obviously I should taper? I am not sure about grams but what I usually took was equivalent to one tablespoon twice daily of mainly red md or sometimes red gold. \n\nAny help would be appreciated! <e1>I already have horrific symptoms from the Valium taper</e1> (was on that for 7 years doctor prescribed and am only making 10 percent reductions per month)\n\n<e2>Feeling super scared for my life</e2>!

"OK, I have applied for a job at mcdonalds, they want to interview me, however I'm a bit sceptical about going. \n\nI really want a job, I don't care about what it is, I'm so bored at home all the time. I do suffer from other mental health issues, including, OCD, anxiety and depression as well as social phobia. Being stuck at home only makes my mental health worse.\n\nI have a few months off until September when I go back to college. I'm worried about having to interact with - teenagers. Yep, those annoying, cheeky things, especially when they're in groups. Of course, there are some who are nice and polite, even if they don't look it. But in the past I've had bad experiences people their age. I'm just scared of them. I can't stick up for myself unless it's someone who is on the same level as me, if you know what I mean. I just look like a vulnerable target to most people. Also, I'm kind of overweight too, so that makes my confidence worse. \n\nWhat do I do? Shall I go and tell them everything? (Which I probably will) or do I completely avoid it?!\n

"Is that a typical side effect? I'm up to 15mg twice a day. It helps with my anxiety some, although the past 2 days I've removed a lot of caffeine from my diet as well and no panic attacks. I feel anxious sometimes though. Maybe anticipation. \n\nAnyways. Since being on this 15mg of buspar I can fall asleep easy about 11pm but it's like clock work I'm awake at 2 or 3 am and absolutely cannot sleep for shit after.... It's exhausting. I toss and turn all night after that. \n\nI do have Ativan I could take I suppose but I only wanted to use that for panic attacks if needed. \n\nBenadryl? Prescription sleep meds? Idk what to do. Miss my sleep :(

"Hi reddit, \n\nSo i was conscripted 2 and a half months ago at where i am from. While i have made friends and stuff, I always suffer from homesickness and keep worrying about home as well. It has gotten to a point where i am starting to feel depressed and everytime i call home, I get very emotional (but i control it of course). \n\nThanks for listening i guess :)

"He suffers from survivors guilt, put a shotgun in his mouth, daughter pulled it out of his mouth just as it went off. Don't know if it went off accidentally when she grabbed it or if he had made the decision to do it.\n\nHe is in a suicide ward that I can only assume has some obvious skill sets (hopefully not a drug him into oblivion) and will keep him a few days and work with the VA on next steps. We are removing all the weapons from their residence today. In the past, the army had given him some-to-several counselor sessions and put him on an anti-psychotic, which from what I understand actually causes depression and suicidal thoughts in others.\n\nI could use recommendations on reading material, support groups/how to find them if anyone can help. I will look through the posts that are here, but if anyone has familiarity with PTSD veterans with survivors guilt / ptsd, please share if you are able. \n\nThank you\n\n\n\n

I upped my therapy to twice a week, got medicaid and a psych. My therapist left, medicaid removed and due to that lost my psych.

Its stressing my SO out and between her constant insistence that im not doing enough and my ptsd ive developed a strong as fuck depression. I just lay down all damn day everyday in my bed or living room floor. I see my flashbacks everyday during this but i just cant be bothered to do anything about it anymore.

"Why do you care about strangers that post shit on the Internet? Why do you want them to live and cling to life even though it's beating the shit out of them?\n\nYou probably don't. You just leave a message, pat someone on their heads and tell them it's going to be alright. And then disappear, off to do the same to other people and leaving us on their own.\n\nI don't expect you to stay 24/7 and listen to our bullshit. But why do you value life so much? It has more suffering than happy moments and we are all going to die anyway. With death, I won't be able to feel regret if I left opportunities. \n\nI am not sure I even care if my family finds out. Who knows. They may as well fall apart or commit suicide too. I'm a selfish piece of shit anyway. My dad probably hates me for that, although he'd never tell me that.

"Hey! So I will be quitting Kratom CT tomorrow after about a month of daily use at roughly 15-25 grams per day. Thankfully, I've only been using for a month, and it helped me stop smoking weed after years of being a stoner. I have also cut out alcohol too. I have Gaba, fish oil, multi vitamin, and some adrenal vitamins. I also will have 30 1mg Xanax tomorrow, prescribed by a doctor. I'm thinking this will help me fall asleep. My question is: should I pick up something else? What can I expect after only a month of daily use? Thanks so much for everyone's support. I'm genuinely excited about beginning a life of sobriety. I have so many interests, and I'd like to focus my energy towards those.

"I just wanted to see if anyone else has had the same experience as me. I'll have 3 years sober-no subs, alcohol, pot, nothing, this 4th of July...(ironic). I almost on a daily basis have a sneeze fit to this day- at least once. I'm curious if this is opiate related. I had been an IV Heroin user. I have never had any allergies-still don't. I went down to Florida to get sober so maybe that has alot to do with it (Lived in Virginia/Arizona). I've stayed in Florida since treatment. It is so strange to me and i am just curious if anyone else has experienced something similar.That is all. For those just beginning their battle stay strong- it truly gets better as each day goes on.

Going out in the rain was certain death btw.\n\nSo one day she buys me an instrument (her choice) and says I will now play it.  I thought it was cool and I was exited to learn something.

"I think it goes down to whether it's making you feel relax and happy (your true self) or more tired and acting (chameleon). However, both happen at one time, and I think it's hard to differentiate them. And when you two have different points of view, when do you actually discuss the actual solution, rather than just depend on them (or rage at them)?

"Suicide used to be a thought that just kind of dangled outside of the breach when I was depressed. Whenever it would come close I was able to fight it off. The last 5 months I've started to let the thought get closer and closer. It's selfish to want this. It's foolish to think that flipping the switch on my life would be so simple. I used to let mortality drive me to fight, push me to be better but I just can't anymore. I'm so tired of trying to be okay. I'm so sick of watching family and friends get frustrated when they try to help. My life hurts. My willpower is exhausted. I am a parasite that nobody should have to deal with. It might sound self absorbed, but I really truly believe that I shouldn't have to put up with me either. \n\nAs long as there is still a shred of hope left in me, I will not act on this. But every day it feels like there is a little less.. and a little less.. I just feel like I'm not too far away from that curtain call.
