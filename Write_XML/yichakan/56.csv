"I smoked for 22 years, trying to quit many times over the last 3.  I was operating on the understanding that marijuana had zero withdrawal symptoms, which is stupid given my education, understanding of homeostasis, and repeated experience of the same withdrawal symptoms each time I tried to quit (willful blindness much?). While the symptoms are non-existent for many or most, most people also don't smoke from waking to bedtime ever day for years, and some casual users may have issues given their specific biology.  This sub helped me realize that the myth of zero withdrawal symptoms made me attribute the shittiness of quitting (especially psychological and emotional ones) to something innate in myself.  It is not me that is sad or angry about the world, it is my brain that is rewiring itself after decades of abuse.

Through excerpts of interviews with adults diagnosed with ADHD and observations, I illustrate how impairment in time is manifested in an embodied experience of being out of sync.

"Happy New Years guys! Today I want to share some good news! I'm an aspiring comedian and today I finally went live with my webseries. Obviously not posting a link to it, this post isn't about promoting it. I have a long history of coming up with ideas for comedic projects. These ideas start out as solid, produceable ideas, but inevitably <e1>I am so excited about them and the things I could possibly do with them</e1> that <e2>I make them too big and complicated almost immediately</e2>. Then I get overwhelmed by them and drop them, leading to a depressive spiral. In september I started a new comedic project with the focus on keeping it small, simple and doable. With the help of a more organized friend (I seriously think that the help of our friends is one of our best tools for success) I kept it small and released the first episode today. I have a huge backlog of episodes ready to release over the course of the next few weeks. Feels so good to finally finish something and get it out there. Whatever project you are working on, you can make it happen! Keep it simple stupid!

Numbness on lips, pins and needles on lips and a kind of prickly feeling on my arms something but not often. I worry its because of a brain tumor even though I don't fit all the symptoms from what I've read.  I've been to an ear doctor, had balance tests, eye test at opticians and had blood tests and all came back clear. However I still feel bad and feel like something is in my head or it's something in my brain causing these feelings. Could it really be anxiety?! Thanks for your help. This is driving my crazy.

"So I've been taking Vyvanse and Dexedrine for about a month now (50mg and then a 15mg booster of dexedrine). It's been working great and it has helped me change my damn life around. If I knew where I was going to be today I wouldn't believe it. I used to be unmotivated and slightly sad most of the time, now I feel like I can do anything. There is one problem though, on days I don't take my meds I get EXTREMELY lethargic and can't muster up the energy to do stuff. I mean I can still function, but it feels like a huge pain in the ass and even more so than before starting them. Is this normal, I don't want to become addicted to them, having to take them everyday just to be able to function. <e1>On days I don't take it I need some sort of stimulation</e1>, so <e2>I opt for coffee</e2> (although I never drink it on meds).

If I don't remember to schedule an appointment or forget to go to one I already had then they won't give me a refill until I do and usually there won't be open appointments for a week or 2. Don't they understand that I'll run out before the next appointment? They act like I'm not dependent on it and just expect me to not have any for days. Luckily this time I was able to schedule an appointment for 5 days after I'm supposed to run out, but I have a couple extra days of medication in case something like this happens. It's just so hard to reduce my daily amount or not take any. I struggle enough to do things with taking adderall not to mention without it is even harder.

When you throw words together like that it makes it seem like a societal disorder or a behavioral disorder, which it is for some people, but again they are all just symptoms. The things that are actually important about ADHD to me is motivation, organization, and processing. The lack of attention is really because I lack motivation to pay attention.

"Hey guys been lurking here for a few days now as I build up the mental capacity to hit my scheduled quit date on Friday. I've been smoking since college about 10 years ago and have tried and failed to quit more than 5 times over that decade. What usually makes me fail are moments of anger or depression and I am usually always near a family member who smokes when it happens and they just sort of talk and talk and pressure me to have a smoke to calm down. Luckily I won't be around most of them anytime soon, but I am worried about the biggest enabler in my family, my mom. I would keep my distance but due to work schedules I have to see her at least twice a week or more to pick up my kids. Long story short, does anyone have any advice about how to best handle it so that I don't fall off the wagon again? I would really love it if I could be done with this smoking for good this time.

"Does anyone have any experience being tested for this?  I've been suffering from an anxiety disorder that popped up out of the blue about thirteen years ago.  In that time I've had almost every therapy available and a plethora of drug cocktails but nothing has worked.  I've been physically getting more ill and I stumbled upon Pheo's.  I've spent a few hours watching youtube videos of patient accounts and doctor conferences and all of the symptoms really do line up with what I've been going through. My problem is, I'm afraid I'm making it up to have something wrong with me other than this mental health thing that I can't seem to get under control.

I've been sick this week (like, headaches and dizziness and blood pressure so low the doctor thought the cuff thingy was broken) and I have felt like my Adderall has been affecting me in different ways than usual.  Like, I'm just as rambly and unfiltered and unfocussed as when not on my meds, and in a lot of ways it's seemed like the Adderall has just straight up lost it's effects. The side effects have worsened though, the jitteriness and appetite loss and stomachachey stuff, and the insomnia has worsened tenfold (which makes me sicker, which only prolongs the whole problem).  Is this just me reading into things? Do you feel like your meds affect you differently when sick? For that matter, do you feel like ADHD gets a lot worse when you're sick?

"Yesterday my anxiety got triggered due to an assignment. I managed to stop my self from having an anxiety attack. However, I feel like shit. I want to burst out crying, my head hurts and my breathing is shallow. Just the thought that it is back is making me have suicidal thoughts. I dont want to go through this again. I want to be happy.  What do I do? It is still in its early stages so I think I can manage it. I dont know how though.

"So I've been on 40mg of citalopram for almost ten years now. I don't know what the deal is but it doesn't seem to be helping as much as it once did. It's possible that my circumstances have changed and it's not the medicine's fault but I'm considering trying an alternative to see if I can get more relief from my anxiety issues. So my question is, has anyone tried citalopram and tried something else that they had more luck with? I tried Zoloft a few years ago and it seemed to make things even worse. I'm open to suggestions!

"Hi folks I have had anxiety attacks and panic attacks with zero medication for the better part of a year. <e1>The anxiety has been highly debilitating</e1> to the point that <e2>I couldn't leave home</e2>.   During that time,  I was on a small dose of klonopin .25mg for a few months as part of seizure control (im an epileptic).  I eventually tapered down off the klonopin.   I finally got an appointment with a decent psychiatrist from a larger hospital. The doc stated my anxiety at this point (scaled up to a 25) is going to lead to far worse problems including agoraphobia and extreme depression.  She thought it best if I go back on Klonopin as a long term solution combined with weekly therapy.  I hear the horror stories regarding benzos in general.  That always makes me nervous.  I have zero history of substance abuse, I don't even drink.  From their point of view I have a nonaddictive personality. Anyone in a similar situation with Klonopin as a long term therapy?  I had zero side effects from it in the past.  It did stop my seizure as a rescue med.  I would love to hear your views.

"Hi,  I am a life science student and even though I am super excited about my research topic, I really struggle with things like  * remembering to keep a lab journal (or: how to avoid re-do experiments because I forgot to write down what I did and did not remember?)   * repetitive tasks like preparing buffers (I tend to procrastinate)  * not getting frustrated with the really long feedback loops in general   I would be glad to hear experiences or strategies from others here!

"Not sure if this is the right sub for it, but with spring break coming up for me next week, I was hoping to get an accountability somewhere. I have a bad habit over most breaks/long weekends of telling myself how productive I'll be, spend every day during the break telling myself how productive I'll be tomorrow, <e1>end up getting nothing done</e1> and <e2>being disappointed in myself the last day</e2>. Then a week later I start thinking to myself \I need a week off to do this stuff. Wait

"I have always been pretty open with those in my life about having ADHD and what having the disorder entails and how it presents itself. Most people are just like, 'ok, whatever. We all have our own demons' and move on with things. But some of the people I meet end up having pretty deep conversations with me about how it impacts my life. And sometimes my advocacy and openness helps people even when I don't know it.  My boyfriend of a year and a half is currently in the process of getting tested for ADHD (after a bit of light prodding from me last semester) and one of my close friends just approached me, asking how to get started with the diagnosis process.   The fact that someone's life has been positively impacted by my willingness to talk about my struggles is really humbling. I never thought being open about my disability would ever have any impact on others, I just wanted people to have a little compassion and understanding when I struggled with things in life. To those who speak out about their struggles, keep up the work! To others, don't be afraid to speak out!

"This probably sounds dumb but <e1>I take 20 mg of lexapro every morning</e1> for <e2>extremely bad anxiety</e2>. For the life of me I can't remember if I took it this morning or not. Just about 30 minutes or so ago I started feeling slightly weird/spacey and now I'm worried that I actually did forget and I'm going to get worse symptoms...but <e3>I'm also afraid to take it</e3> because <e4>then I don't want to take it twice in a day</e4> in case I actually did..?  Last time I forgot it, it wasn't until evening that I started feeling it.

"I've (26 F) had anxiety practically since I was a child, but the health anxiety is newer. It's been creeping up for a while, but ever since my grandmother died in September, it has become debilitating. I am terrified of dying and obsessively notice anything slightly off physically and jump to the worst conclusion. For example, a headache = brain aneurysm, chest pain = heart attack, etc. It's become difficult for me to enjoy anything, focus on anything, or leave the house since I have panic attacks every day. I'm currently in therapy and on 10mg of Lexapro. <e1>I feel so embarrassed and childish</e1> because of <e2>my fear of death</e2>. Do any of you deal with this or have any tips to offer? I'm exhausted.

"I'm a first-year student and live in residence. Unfortunately I made the decision to speak to my friend about my depression, who then told our RA. Ever since this happened, I feel as if my residence is treating me unfairly.  They sent me a letter saying they considered me as \a danger to myself and others\"" and have threatened to kick me out if I ever openly talk about thoughts of suicide.  They also turned me down for an RA position because of the fact that they are aware of my depression.  I'm hurt by their actions. I am watched constantly

"I try to explain to my SO that my negative/suicidal thoughts are something that I'm working on. That I don't want to think about ending my life (how, when, where). But he doesn't seem to understand WHY I would want to do it. It makes no sense to him that someone would want to end their life. That it's so extreme. How people can even think of wanting to die. How my thoughts overtake me and send me into my dark place.  On a side note, he's very supportive. He's helped me through my darkest times but I can tell there's still something that he can't quiet grasp or understand.  He's coming to one of my therapy sessions with me. I'm hoping this may help open his perspective that it's something I'm trying to fix but it takes time... Has anyone else had this problem? How did you deal with it?

"<e1>I've run out of hope, I have no hobbies</e1> cause <e2>I dont like anything</e2>, I cant get out of bed in the morning, I am miserable every minute of every day, it just doesnt stop. Even seeing friends and things doesnt help it subside, its still there, people have told me all the time that things do get better but as far as I can see, things have only ever gotten worse. I cannot think of a time things have improved for me. If life is going to be a long, miserable, spiteful experience then I dont know why Im still here.

"My husband and I started watching The People Vs. OJ Simpson this week, and during some of the episodes I've spent time looking up stuff online related to what is being shown in the episodes. I've basically gone down the rabbit hole learning different things about the people being portrayed, the actors portraying them, how the events actually went down, etc. I've gone into hyperfocus mode over a subject that is totally not important or vital to anything.  If only I could apply this hyperfocus where it is needed instead, and do better in my graduate program. But instead, I know more about the OJ Simpson trial than I probably ever needed to know.
