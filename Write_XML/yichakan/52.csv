"So every time I'm away from my girlfriend (3 and a half years very serious Yada Yada probably soon to be married) I feel extremely anxious constantly and it kinda eats at me. I've tried to identify my problems. I constantly am imagining the worst case scenario and I'm not sure how to stop this. I have a constant nagging feeling that I'm not good enough for her. It's like I constantly build her up and put myself down, but no one else around is putting me down. We have a very healthy relationship aside from these feelings that I have most of which probably stem from a major lack of self confidence. Should I inform her of this? I'm not really sure how else to fix this. I'm usually not one to feel sorry for myself but this has really been eating at me and I just can't shake it.

That one person here who told me the depression was going to kick my ass was right! I didn't last two weeks but I digress. I haven't had a cigarette in over 24 hours and have been using the patch just about the same amount of time. I started with the highest dosage patch but I honestly don't want to prolong the amount of time I use the patch nor want to continue throwing money away on nicotine. My question is, would it be smart to not repurchase patches after I'm done with this box (7 count, have 5 left) and basically quit cold turkey? I figured that a week without actual cigarettes would be a very good start to letting them go completely. The patch would serve as a buffer of sorts but it's not something I want to do for 8 weeks, I just want to be rid of all this stuff completely.

#####Steps to expressing anger
1) Stop. Breathe.2) Identify our judgmental thoughts. 3) Connect with our feelings/needs. 4) Express our feelings and unmet needs. 5) Make a clear request of what we would like from the listener. Could be a reflection of what was heard.#####Sources / Further Readinghttp://www.feelyourneeds.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;lang=english http://www.compassionateinteractions.com/expressinganger.php http://www.nvcworld.com/harnessing-the-power-of-anger

"So I finally made the decision to do something about myself a few weeks ago and go back to rehab. Just got out (my insurance only covers 16 days) and <e1>I'm getting crazy frustrated with my body</e1> because <e2>I wake up at 3/4am every morning still feeling like I'm going to puke my guts out</e2>. Like really, it's been 19 days?!? Ive been thru this multiple times and this is hands down the worst physical detox ever. As a women, I can only compare it to horrible morning sickness and no, def not pregnant. Has anyone else ever experienced this or have any tips to curb the nausea? It goes away by like, 10 am but every single morning its a struggle to get past it especially now that I'm home and I know how to make myself feel better in seconds only I don't wanna do that. It's pretty awesome that I turned a corner in treatment and got some fucking hope back but this shit is hard sometimes.

I tried to tell the that the PD here (chicago) frequently shoot people with mental health issues.Not sure what I'm asking for, but I feel completely unhinged and am worried I'm going to 1) drown myself in the lake 2) jump in front of the nearby train or 3) call the police and do 'cop-by-suicide.'

I have been slowly trying to improve myself I started working out not to long ago, I have tried being more outgoing to meet friends, but I always feel out of place or ignored... I don't want to sound selfish or creepy, but I just want a person I can have a connection with. Another thing that kills me inside is when people compare me to others (Ohh why can't you be more like ____? He is so talented and funny!) I try...I really do... But it's so hard to feel accepted in a society that demands perfection....It always feels like people around me were created perfectly and I was just what was left over..I don't know what to do, I don't have anyone to talk to that wouldn't say \Oh grow some balls you pussy\"". I hope someone can at least relate to me on here..I will NEVER end \""it\"" but I just feel less happy each day.... This isn't a recent thing

I thought it was working, but now I realize that was probably a placebo. The next few days it had no affect when I sat down at the desk to do work, felt none the different in terms of focus.

I don't want things to hit rock bottom again. I don't know if I can handle it this time. I guess I'm just looking for advice and/or personal experiences similar to mine. Thank you in advance.
