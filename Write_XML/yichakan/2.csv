"""so ive dealt with chronic depression my whole life, i have a lot of strategies to help and im almost in my thirties, im <e1>proud</e1> that ive <e2>become pretty functional</e2>. but i still have dark days or weeks or sometimes months, and i know i will again in my life. but i can go to work, get along well with my co-workers and clients, and dont let things spiral until my life implodes like i used to. always reminds me of a line from a song by the naked and famous:there are certain things that i have to do. day to day just to keep it at bay, you wouldnt believe if you knewand ive been doing okay with that. but i let things in my personal life, the parts i can keep private or arent a big deal slip consistently. my room is always a mess, i let my beard get big and bushy even though i (and everyone i know) thinks it looks much better trimmed, leave bills unpaid too long, the usual put off until tomorrow what i could do today sort of stuff. and not even to do fun stuff, i just kind of dither and worry about the things im not doing.a few weeks ago a cat just kind of showed up in my life. one of my roommates left the place and didnt take his cat with him, the lease holder wanted to give him to the humane society but dragged his feet about it. the cat decided i was his person now, started following me around like a puppy and meowing pathetically if i didnt let him hang out in my room. i <e3>was reluctant to adopt him</e3> because i <e4>was raised to believe pets are a ride or die engagement</e4>, and i <e5>wasnt sure i was ready for the commitment</e5>. finally the lease holder said he was going to <e6>take him to the humane society</e6> that afternoon, i said bye to him with some <e7>sadness</e7>, and went to work. but he had only <e8>been my cat for a week</e8> so i <e9>figure better he go sooner before he got too attached</e9>. hes <e10>an adorable sweet boy and only a year old</e10> so i <e11>didnt think he would languish too long</e11> and he was being taken to a no-kill shelter.while i was at work it really stuck in my craw. i just kept imagining the poor little guy sitting in a cage and not knowing why he had been brought there or what would happen next. but when i got home he was still there! i decided screw it, hes my cat now. told my roommates id take responsibility for him and <e12>dubbed him jonesy</e12>, cause he <e13>looks like the cat from alien</e13>.ive been taking care of him for about 3 weeks and my life has improved in pretty much every way. there is <e14>the mental health improvement from having an animal around</e14>, hes <e15>a very affectionate cat</e15>. he waits for me by the door when he hears my car park like a dog, and he pretty much always wants to cuddle. but there is also the improvement from having something to take care of. ive been <e16>keeping my room clean</e16> because he <e17>will try to play with anything that crinkles or clanks</e17>, so <e18>empty cans or bags of chips or whatever are a no go</e18>. i always actively play with him when i get home from work, and just focusing on being present for that period of time and doing nothing but interacting with the cat (i dont answer text, listen to music, watch tv, i just play with jonesy) is very calming and centering. cleaning my room has expanded into just taking better care of myself in general. im drinking less, flossing twice a day, keeping the beard neat. i usually feel like all the little things i dont do are constantly piling up, but right now for the first time in my life i feel like im catching up.im straight up embarrassed by how much i love this animal. hes my little fuzzy rock in a sea of chaos. i cant control much in the world but i can give this little bastard the best goddamn cat life a cat can have. i know there will still be some dark times ahead but i feel like i have a new ally in the daily struggle. just wanted to rant about my cat and feeling good for the first time in awhile, thanks for reading! edit: its so nice to hear everyones stories, thanks for commenting!""","Cause-Effect((e2,e1),(e4,e3),(e5,e3),(e6,e7),(e8,e9),(e10,e11),(e13,e12),(e15,e14),(e17,e16),(e18,e16))",0,3,2

"""edit: wow, i didn't expect this many responses. yall are really kind. i really appreciate your advice and support and it will take me some time to read each response carefully and find the words to respond to it. thank you all so much.[originally posted on r/advice as """"why am i such a pathetic loser and how do i fix it before it gets me killed?"""" <e1>my request for advice was downvoted there</e1> and i'm <e2>worried no one will reply</e2> because of that. also, this seems like a better place to voice these concerns anyway.]i'm 26 years old. my problem is this. i'm a quitter with no willpower. i give up on everything before i've even had a chance to really try. i'm afraid of putting in effort, and if i'm forced to make an effort, i do quite well for awhile, and then freeze up at some point late into the process, panic, dig my feet into the ground, drop everything, and stubbornly persist in inaction until all my progress has been sabotaged. this attitude and approach toward everything i do has ruined my life.through elementary school and high school, i was eccentric and asocial, but brilliant. my performance was excellent, far above the curve, right up to the end. then, in the middle of 12th grade, i stopped trying. i didn't mean to stop trying. it was more like i couldn't try anymore even if i tried to try. like my try engine was busted. <e3>my performance declined immediately</e3>, and it was only because <e4>i'd done so well up to that point that i still managed to graduate with excellent grades</e4>.my performance up to that point got me a few merit scholarships, none of them in the area. one was for a school in pennsylvania. i'm from the bay area in northern california, and <e5>my single mother was poor</e5> and we wanted to <e6>save money by any means possible</e6>, so i <e7>moved to pennsylvania to go to college</e7>. this was perhaps too bold of me. because i <e8>was used to succeeding</e8>, i <e9>was spoiled</e9> and <e10>believed i could do anything effortlessly</e10>. i believed i wouldn't have any transition pains. friends, don't be smart, it makes you stupid.i did well for one year, but i was miserable. then i <e11>did pretty badly for most of another year</e11> because i <e12>froze up again and refused to make an effort</e12>. i <e13>felt like the world around me wasn't real</e13>, like every person and every building was made of cardboard and nothing i <e14>could do would have any consequence</e14>, so i just <e15>stayed in my dorm room all day every day</e15>. i wound up <e16>having to withdraw</e16> to <e17>avoid having it on my record</e17> that i'd flunked out, so <e18>i moved back to california to be with my mom again</e18>.my credits from pennsylvania couldn't be considered, so i had to go to community college for another, well, two years, i think? then, with my grades already ruined and age having made me less attractive a prospect, we bit the bullet and sent me to a local university without a scholarship as a transfer student, with money we didn't really have per se.i did kind of well for a year, and then started resisting my own progress again and having mental breakdowns. my second year, i wound up <e19>having to withdraw</e19> because i <e20>refused to make an effort any longer</e20>. i then repeated my second year and finished it. the year after that, <e21>my mother passed away unexpectedly</e21> and i had to <e22>withdraw again</e22> (though, for once, it's understandable).it's been 2 years since then, and everything since then has just blurred together and left me confused, but i think what happened was something like this: i came back to try again when i felt i was ready, i <e23>was wrong and wasn't ready</e23> so i <e24>had to withdraw again</e24>, i came back again, and (very recently) after fighting a losing battle to stay afloat, i just completely gave up and decided i'm fundamentally not good enough for this. i withdrew permanently, on the very year i was meant to finally graduate.""
