Sometimes when I am trying to work on something at my job or at home and I get distracted by someone or something, my body freezes up for a second and I feel like I can't move.

"We are celebrating something for our son next weekend. After a dramatic start to VLV-NC with my Nrents in February, Nmom is shocked and horrified that I could be so terrible to them. She doesn't understand what she has done wrong. In the past several weeks I have received two seething emails (one from each Nrent) and spoke to each once. This is the first time I've stood up to them for this long. I finally hit my breaking point where I will no longer accept the toxic behavior. NMom revealed to my sister that she will show up to the event to watch and then after, give him a card. This is making me anxious. My kids do not want to see her and I do not want her to cause a scene, even a mild one, and potentially ruin his day.

Last night I layed in bed with my eyes closed in a dark room from 10pm until well after 1 am.\nIs this a normal? I have been an everyday smoker for 6 or 7 years now. I've been feeling very anxious and depressed as of late and I decides that weed was the culprit. 5 days in my anxiety hasn't been acting up and I feel full of energy and happy. The only thing is that I haven't felt tired in 4 days. I lay in bed and pretty much wait until morning. Is this a common side effect? Could anyone give me any insight into how long before they regained the ability to feel tired? So far I am loving the sober life, I just wanna sleep.

As someone who's been struggling with the overwhelming process of choosing a college and beginning the application process, this breaks all the steps down into tiny, manageable chunks, and has progress meters for the different steps towards applying to college:\n\n* Making school count\n* Looking ahead to college\n* Careers and majors\n* Finding colleges for you\n* Applying for college\n* Paying for college \n\nThe plan shifts as you progress through each school year, and provides reminders for planning next year's classes, applying for and receiving financial aid, application dates for college  due dates and when things like deposits are due for university housing. The website also allows you to calculate your cost contribution to college, and to keep track of your test registration and academic progress. \n\nThis site is a godsend for people like me, and I wanted to spread awareness. <e1>Good minds should not go to waste</e1> because <e2>the application process is overwhelming</e2>.
