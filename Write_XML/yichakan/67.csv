When I was smoking, I was afraid that quitting would strip me of all coping mechanisms and I'd be left completely bare and vulnerable to all anxieties and issues I was afraid of facing in the first place. Quitting has shown me that I'm a much stronger person than I thought, even without a crutch. The absence of weed forces me to solve my problems and learn from them instead of stuffing them way deep down and covering them in smoke.

"I have two friends (Mitch and Alex). I was supposed to move in with Mitch next month, but Alex will be living with him too until September 1st. Well, Mitch didn't tell Alex about me moving in and Alex knows about my abusive BPD behavior towards people I date. This concerned her and she wanted the three of us to talk about my past behavior and she even said if they don't feel comfortable that I may have to find a new place to live. It was a back and forth FB conversation and I was defensive. I told her I faced homelessness and that I was freaking out. I decided to talk to Mitch instead first. He said I can move in when we agree'd. Alex does have money, is a PHD student, and has never been homeless. Well, she ended blocking me on FB and I saw her today at an event. She kept leaving when I was near her. Was I in the wrong? Should I maintain a relationship?

To those of you who, like myself, are experiencing distress over distancing yourself from emotionally abusive family, please listen. It's ok. It's ok that you don't want to spend time with them. It's ok if you avoid family, when seeing them causes nothing but stress and triggers some bad things mentally. It's ok to choose your own family. There are plenty of decent loving humans out there who would be happy to be a part of your chosen family. It's ok if you hurt your birth family's feelings by avoiding them, if avoiding them is necessary for your emotional and psychological wellbeing. I don't know if any of you needed this. But I sure did. If you're reading this, listen. You are special and deserve to live your own life. &lt;3*Edit: Damn, I had no idea how well this was going to be received.

"A few weeks ago John Cena came to my country for a 'talking tour'. He did a live interview for 30-45 mins then a 30 min Q&amp;A. At one point he spoke about growing up in a household of rigid, stiff love and how he didn't have much family support. He also spoke a lot about why he got into certain hobbies such as the gym or playing sports, how he was treated at school, etc. I found it odd how relatable it was. I could've been saying some of these things to someone verbatim. It was oddly reassuring. But I haven't really had the chance to tell anyone about this. Most may not achieve Cena's level of professional success but I believe people can achieve his level of self acceptance and resilience and persistency. I've found it hard lately (especially coming off a very good first half year where I was feeling good) but hearing Cena talk about the aftermath of his self betterment is encouraging.  The older I get the more I appreciate and respect John Cena.

"Hi, I am following a story out of Missouri about decades of abuse by the same teacher in a school district. I was abused by a teacher in the late 1980s in New Jersey. I have talked to prosecutors in the area about pressing charges, but I missed the statute of limitations by 6 weeks. The teacher was forced out of the school district three years ago after he got caught grooming another student. I know there must have been others between myself and that student. Has anyone here ever tried to track down other victims of the same person? Are there forums related to that, or resources I could use?

I'm thinking tomorrow after the tents are up and we are getting settled in I might drop the news. Anyway, I think this might really and truly be the most tempting and difficult event I have planned all year. Combine that with the fact that I'm only days into this journey....

Some of it is that they have shown me that they don't see mental illness as a real thing. They seem to think it's all about will. Unfortunately reaching out and being open with them has been very difficult. My brother always minimizes and ridicules what I share (a habit he seems to have inherited from our narcissist father). They have no idea how frozen I am on  the inside. I have literally no access to my words when I try to talk with them. And they always seem to have a rebuttal or logic-based argument. This is not a logical problem. It's not a matter of just thinking straight. I'm constantly forgetting stuff? And there's just so much noise that it's seriously hard. I never intended it to be perceived this way - as being distant. But that's what they see. Now what? Am I just hopeless?

I'm ashamed to use explicit language. I'm suddenly afraid of my therapist (of five years). I'm afraid to lose control over the situation. I don't know where to start. Do you start with the worst parts, at the beginning? I decided to start with, what I though was, a not so bad story. One of the few stories where I was still in control. My therapist and I talked briefly about it. He said I was distant and factual. I'm at home now and it's completely back firing. My judgement of that story is completely tilting and I don't know how to deal with that. So my question is, how do you do it? Thank you so much for sharing your experiences.
