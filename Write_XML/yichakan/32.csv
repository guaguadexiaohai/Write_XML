"MDMA Reaches Next Step Toward Approval for Treatment - The New York Times (nytimes.com)Of the 90 people who took part in the new study, which is expected to be published later this month in Nature Medicine, those who received MDMA during therapy experienced a significantly greater reduction in the severity of their symptoms compared with those who received therapy and an inactive placebo. Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group.MDMA produced no serious adverse side effects. Some participants temporarily experienced mild symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite.¡°This is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,¡± said Gul Dolen, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. ¡°There is nothing like this in clinical trial results for a neuropsychiatric disease.¡±

And anytime I try to push myself to talk, it feels like it goes against the entire nature of my being. As if speaking will put me in a terrible situation.It feels very similar to a freeze response, however, there¡¯s been plenty of times where I¡¯ve been unable to talk, yet I¡¯ll be free from any dissociation or fogginess.

You wouldn't tell me I didn't break my bones, becasue only veterans can have broken bones. You wouldn't tell me to suck it up and walk it off. You wouldn't dismiss my thoughts and feelings as just the product of pain.

However, nothing really changed at work and I'm still struggling. I brought it up last week and now I have a meeting either my boss this week to discuss what we could specifically implement to help me out at work.The issue is that there's not really any certain trigger or something for me to avoid or something I need help with specifically. My issue at work is dissociating and not being able to focus on documents when I'm reviewing them, which leads to mistakes in documents.

Then she gets annoyed when I say in no uncertain terms that she needs to stop.Then she says ""why are you so angry all the time.

"I've been on a Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul kick recently and was watching an episode tonight before bed. I'm on season 4 episode 10 watching the scene between Walt and his son. The exchange felt just like the exchanges I'd have with my dad when he was drunk and I was a teenager. Some of the things Walt said were almost verbatim something my dad would say to me.I felt this scene triggering my PTSD and I started having flashbacks. Rather than keep watching I took care of myself and turned off the show. Rather than grab the vodka that's sitting in the freezer I let myself feel the emotions as they came. I called my dog out to sit with me and I let myself cry for the first time in months. I let myself cry multiple times. I sat with my dog and my emotions for a few minutes after my tears subsided.

Some of these include heart palpitations, cystic acne, stiff joints, anxiety, and poor sleep. They somewhat worsen when he is home but not severely unless we argue and he blows up. When he leaves, I feel incredibly drained, have zero motivation, and dont feel like myself for a week or so. My physical symptoms go away too.

"I can never quite understand how parents simply allow their children to speak in silly voices, say ridiculous things, or do funny stuff; like, that was so monumentally-not-allowed in my childhood that I still have problems expressing myself at 27. I still expect the soul-crushing glare of contempt from every witness any time I do/say anything rooted in my own self-expression - and more often than not, I stop myself long before I get to that point.Why doesn't the typical parent crack down and micromanage everything their child does? Why isn't the child's every word and action monitored, questioned and corrected? Why are they not excessively-shamed for every silly thing they say or do? It makes no sense to me.My self-expression being something of shame is so matter-of-fact to me that I genuinely can't see why it wouldn't be shameful.

Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group.MDMA produced no serious adverse side effects. Some participants temporarily experienced mild symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite.¡°This is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,¡± said Gul Dolen, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. ¡°There is nothing like this in clinical trial results for a neuropsychiatric disease.¡±

You probably believe that the world is kind, that there is meaning to your life, and that things make sense. You believe that you are good and worthy of having good things happen to you. Then trauma strikes. It seems as though you are no longer in control of what has happened around you. You're vulnerable and your world is no longer safe and secure. Furthermore, you can't make sense of what is left over. The meaning of life that you recognized just a short time before is gone.

"I did this for years without ever realizing it. Every time I got tense, I would unconsciously hold my breath. I would hold it that way for just a few seconds before I started to breathe again, so it wasn't long enough for me to pass out or whatever. But I probably did it 10 times every day, without realizing it.When I finally noticed the pattern, I started paying attention to it. I'd mentally check in with my breath every so often and I'd notice ""Hey, I'm not breathing right now!"". Then I'd use all my willpower to take a breath, and there'd be this moment where even my maximum willpower wasn't enough, like the anti-breathing instinct was too strong, and then suddenly my willpower would break through and I'd take a huge deep breath all of a sudden.I'd developed dizzy spells from my nervous breakdown, but after a few months of doing this breathing thing, I was holding my breath less often and I was having fewer dizzy spells (though they didn't go away entirely).So maybe check in with your own breathing once in awhile, to see if you have the same problem.

"So I just had a massive fit of emotional flashback in the psychiatric ward yesterday, weeping uncontrollably, digging my nails into my flesh and one step away from banging my head against the wall. Today a therapist came to discuss coping skills with me (short term inpatient therapy). Unfortunately, it was barely helpful. Not only do I know the skills, I have been actively practicing mindful breathing and grounding techniques every day for years. They are definitely helpful, but there is a threshold where they are simply utterly useless. There are episodes of flashbacks that can be calmed with techniques, and then there are ones that are not much different from being strangled by an invisible demon. In those times, the idea of coping skills basically boils down to ""try doing something different and try harder"". That doesn't help someone being strangled. The conversation led me to one question: Has anyone experienced something similar, going through a massive episode of suicidality with all the awareness and logical thinking well intact, all the coping skills well trained, and yet none of those seem helpful?

"Hello all! I've got a pretty simple question, I guess...Around the Internet, I've seen mentions of ""self-triggering."" But one of the primary marks of PTSD in the DSM-5 is avoidance of triggering things, and I assume the same logic applies to CPTSD. I match up eerily well to CPTSD, but I feel like I couldn't have it if I do sometimes trigger myself?For example, I have ADHD (diagnosed) and when I get bored or too disjointed to attempt to focus, I often find myself scrolling through memes, infographics, etc. of a triggering nature and/or I'll listen to sad music that only boosts the depression.... until I breakdown or dissociate.So, tl;dr, is self-triggering a thing within the realm of CPTSD?

This can be a memory (for me since I have amnesia that's mostly not the case ) or a trembling / shacking and emotion (that's the case for me most of the time )So whenever your symptoms skyrocket, are unbearable, be assured that there is something looking to leave your body.This formula makes something terrible bearable.I hope this helps, it might be obvious to you but with the confusion during high symptom states, this might be something worth putting a note on your fridge for.

"I am at a point in recovery where I can see myself as a 12 year old child and feel the absolute pain and sorrow of abandonment. With that being said, this has made daily tasks harder and harder. I find the sensitivity and fear that I have masked for years under defense mechanisms is getting the best of me. I have an acceptable support system that I try my best to utilize at time. But honestly, this is exhausting. To add to that, I graduate from university in a couple of weeks and have finals coming up these five days.I've been gradually feeling more like myself I suppose, and I am coming to be more open and accepting of others. But how long till at least life is acceptable and livable.I know this is a very broad and generalized question, but I would really appreciate some perspective from those who have gotten further and those for who stress and fear does not rule their daily life.

"Like a lot of people with CPTSD, I used to inwardly, sometimes outwardly, think that if I was a better kid I wouldn't have been abused and neglected. Through therapy and work and reading and support like this, that changed eventually. Now I know that I did not deserve that treatment or abuse. NO child or adult should ever be abused or deserves abuse, NO EXCEPTIONS.Now my flashbacks, which occur during certain times of the year especially (Mothers Day - not helping) are causing rage. Like, I want to scream. I want to break things (but I won't as that would be scary and abusive to my spouse) - I just want revenge. There is no closure. When seeking closure I get gaslit. So there is no closure, and there will be no closure, and I think that is the real cause of the rage. It's still an open problem. Without fixing the problem, it's just there, burning holes in me.So the healing journey - does it read: Self-hate, rage --- and then what? What comes after this? When will it be ""acceptance and self-love and no more unwanted flashbacks?""

"Embracing me a little too intimately, singing love songs to me, giving me romantically-loving looks, saying I am her rock and her soulmate and her only reason for living. <e1>Insisting she can see me naked</e1> because <e2>she ¡°gave birth to me¡±</e2>  and therefore has the right. Making me her therapist. Breaking down in front of me and asking if I love her, whether she¡¯s a good person.These are just examples off the top of my head. All of her kids feel uncomfortable hugging her fully, looking into her eyes, etc. I always thought it was a mother¡¯s deep love but one day I realized that this is how you treat a boyfriend, not a daughter.She¡¯s a good person, but she has no sense of boundaries.

"Tomorrow a person who triggers a lot of my anxiety, is coming to my work to do golfing. While he will not be in my direct vicinity, I will constantly be on high alert/feeling anxious for my shift, since there¡¯s an entire 18 holed golf course here. I¡¯m scared.and...On Sunday there¡¯s a party going on the entire day, and naturally, loud noises and many people will be scaring the shit out of me, especially now that I¡¯m told guests will occasionally enter the room I will be hiding in, to see my friends¡¯ cool room (I live in there for now), and I will have to deal with small talk with absolute strangers. (My friend promises to be there and try to run interference, but I will still have random interruptions) Could I go outside during this? Usually yes but itll be very hot and I wont know when the party will end nor do I have friends here I could visit.This ptsd shit sucks guys. 10/10 do not recommend.Tf do I do?

" <e1>It might be hard to understand my writing</e1> because <e2>english is not my first language</e2> .My abusive mother and grandmother had this very bizzare way of injecting blame, shame and guilt, it goes like this:For example I have a health-related concern and I decide to go to a doctor and it turns out to be nothing.My mother would say something like this: How could you waist all of those resources and ask so many people to help you to go to this doctor if it was nothing, this is just useless, you should have known better.It's bizzare! It's like I somehow forgot to check by time-traveling. It always made me so angry. And it works too. When my health concern turns out to be nothing I don't feel relif, I feel guilty.Does anyone else experienced something similar?I feel like my whole wolrdview is warped by this guilt pattern. I always feel guilty when I buy too much food or too little, like I could have known in advance somehow. If anyone have any advice on this it would be greatly appreciated.

"I've only done it twice, but I am not the type of person to slack off and get paid for doing nothing. I will make up for the hours I lost but what the hell. What are some tips that I can use to not fall asleep? I can go for 2-3 hours at a time. I tell myself I need to lie down on my couch for 10 mins as my break and next thing I know ive dozed off.I have never been good with self control and I don't want this to affect my job :/ it's a bit more complicated than saying, just <e1>don't sleep</e1>,  because <e2>sleep overcomes me</e2> and I can't go it!!

"Obviously if you have PTSD you have trauma, but is it true the other way around?  <e1>I have never faced anything that was traumatic</e1> due to <e2>a violent or sexual experience</e2> . BUT <e3>I was extremely, immensely, severely anxious as a child</e3>-- mostly due to <e4>being autistic and all the conflict that came from my family and I not understanding each other</e4> .  I was always on edge with no vacation.I feel like I've moved on from it, for the most part, but I still get flashback. Of angry faces, and times when I curled up in a fetal position wishing I could be like other kids.  I feel like this counts as trauma and it went on for several years.But I don't know if it's enough to ""qualify"" as having true PTSD.

"I identify as ace and believe i really don't have a libido at all. Was talking to a sexual last night about orgasms and i felt so ashamed that i had to google what it was and i still don't understand and cant imagine what one is. I flashed back to being bullied by my parents for being noticably depressed as a child. Cant help but think its genetic. My parents never showed any affection or attraction towards each other so I cant help but think i was just set up to be a defective human early on. And i will always be defective (sexually at least) cause im on meds for life to deal with chronic pain from trauma. <e1>My heart and my stomach hurt</e1> cause <e2>ill never get physical affection i need</e2> because <e3>most people associate it with sex</e3> and i just cant meet that need and i dont plan on seeing myself doing it ever. Really bummed out, hard to love myself through this one when i feel so dirty and wrong like I shouldn't exist according to laws of human nature. Didnt think it would be a problem until now.

"So, I'm looking into going back to school, and by far the topic I'm most interested in is trauma: how trauma changes the brain, different types and levels of trauma (complex, interpersonal, family, historical and institutional, societal, etc), how to treat trauma, the progression and dimensions of healing, especially in treating / working with stigmatized traumatic experiences and marginalized people.What therapist program / degree will give you specialized trauma training? <e1>I'm thinking of an MSW</e1> because <e2>i like the flexibility</e2>  and I'm not sure if therapy specifically is what I want to do for the rest of my life 24/7 (I think tackling healing from CPTSD also requires action on a policy level, for example), but I hear an MSW isn't likely to give you that much specialized trauma training / education.Any other folks with CPTSD here who are also therapists and/or have gotten more specialized trauma training in school? thanks in advance!

"My boyfriend grew up in a very healthy household. He is an all around happy person, and so are his parents. They are very accepting of me and after two years it is still a HUGE shock to me that they don¡¯t treat me like an outsider, or see me as a threat (my family is very codependent and enmeshed, suspicious of anyone outside the family).They¡¯re just so open, transparent and welcoming. They invite me into their home, buy me gifts and food, and it doesn¡¯t feel like they¡¯re doing it for something in return. <e1>They¡¯ll even help me financially</e1> , just  because <e2>I love their son</e2> .It¡¯s nice, but it feels like I¡¯m still always anxiously waiting for the other shoe to drop. For them to suddenly disapprove of me, not as my boyfriend¡¯s GF, but as a person. I think I¡¯m projecting my trauma with my parents onto them a little.They are a family that is happy and kind, just for the sake of being happy and kind. I¡¯m grateful, but it¡¯s hard to feel safe and 100% comfortable when I grew up around misery. I feel so out of place.

"I have a huge phobia of offending people. I think this relates to me being a massive fawn type. If I make a joke teasing someone, even if they laugh I'll feel bad about it for about a week and act extra friendly towards them. I'm guessing based on the title the book ""The Courage To Be Disliked"" would be helpful, but I was wondering if anyone else had any good resources?Thanks!
