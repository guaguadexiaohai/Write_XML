"So I¡¯m suffering from health anxiety - cardiophobia for 1 year and today after an <e1>adrenaline-rushed</e1> situation I felt my <e2>heart racing</e2> and my <e3>body shaking</e3>.Normally, in situation like this I would start to hyperventilate and think about having a heart attack, but today I silently accepted that I¡¯m having an adrenaline rush / minor panic attack, sat on the bed with my shoulders down and in relaxed position and confidently waited till my heart rate went down.My heart went from peak (130ish) to 100 in about 10 minutes and then it took another hour to go from 100 to 80. Now it¡¯s normal at 65.It¡¯s a big victory for me and I believe I¡¯m on the right path.

When you are anxious your body gets into flight or fight mode. Your body reacts to this in different ways. One of the ways your body responds is by tightening muscles so that you can actually fight or flight. Some of these muscles are in your shoulders. Now try to pay attention to your shoulders and let them hang. They feel tight right? Try to relax them. Try to push them down to the point that feel naturally. In this way, your body signals that you are not in extreme state of alert. This also has a positive influence on the mental part of your anxiety. Let me know if it worked for you.

At least, im on suffering thinking I have a brain tumor. I kept that rational thought of ""If I were to ACTUALLY have it, there is nothing I can do to prevent or change it"". There is no reverse effect to erase it. I still however do sometimes think about it but it goes away for a while.

I went to the doctors and they couldn't see anything wrong had a good feel around and gave me some tablets for heart burn (I do get real bad heart burn). I'm hoping this goes away too, but does anyone else get this? I'm a nervous wreck right now that I'm dying because all these pains are somehow linked and I've got cancer and it's slowly Killing me

Just because I see more PSAs and the like about a certain disease does not mean I am infected with said disease. Look up the ""Baader Meinhof Phenomenon"" and you'll see that noticing things more as you have them on the brain is a normal part of human perception.And I'm sure we can all think of an example or something of a situation with a ""sign"" that didn't turn out like we thought the sign indicated it would. For example, just the other week I saw a rainbow on my way to work. Thought this meant that I would have a good day, but my co-workers were all in poor moods and that made me pissed off for the rest of my Wednesday.Anything can be a sign if you look hard enough.

I had a ECG done in the ER coming back normal and all my other tests did as well. When I had to call 911, I thought I was having a heart attack, but I was just in sinus tachycardia due to my anxiety. It was definitely a very low point for me. I also just graduated with a degree in respiratory therapy so I also believe I just know too much on things that can really hurt you. I¡¯m on a short term medicine because my doctor thinks it¡¯s just a phase, but I am struggling. I have anxiety attacks everyday that last a decent while. Any advice on how to cope with this?

"I want to make this post just to express what I¡¯m feeling in words. I don¡¯t know why, but I¡¯ve been super stressed and anxious this week. I¡¯m only a sophomore in highschool, but I thought I was just stressed about finals coming up next week, and a project we had to do this past week, but I think the real reason I¡¯m <e2>anxious</e2> is because of <e1>a girl</e1>. There¡¯s a girl in one of my classes who is very sweet and has a great personality (her and I <e3>have a lot of the same hobbies and interests</e3>, so she is <e4>very nice to talk to</e4>). I¡¯m a pretty reserved person, so I don¡¯t think I¡¯d ever gain the confidence to ask her out, since we also don¡¯t know each other that well because she is older than me (she¡¯s in her junior year). I think that is the main thing but mixing that anxiety with the stress of school is really getting to me, and I kind of just need to vent. I didn¡¯t really know where else to do it.  I¡¯d love to hear some advice if anyone has any :)

"I¡¯m 19 and in college, but I can¡¯t drive and I don¡¯t make much money at my part time job on campus.My two closest family members are my mom and my boyfriend. My mom constantly struggles with money and works two jobs. As for my boyfriend, his life has just been giving him problem after problem and he¡¯s hit rock bottom. The most recent thing that happened is that his car key stopped working.I am trying to stay as rational as possible but a voice in my head keeps bothering me, saying that I can¡¯t do anything for them and I¡¯m practically useless as a family member.

Now, the only issue I have is that I get anxiety before work - whether I have a long shift like tomorrow or a shorter shift. I¡¯ve always been the type to get anxious when asking a question in class or asking for help. That applies to my job as well, unfortunately. So I¡¯m asking for some advice on how to handle/lessen my anxiety which I don¡¯t really know the cause of because it makes it hard for me to sleep and Google didn¡¯t really help much since most of the articles I looked at were for people with more stressful, full-time jobs. Thank you in advance for any tips!

"Honestly, I haven't felt this anxious in a a long time. Tomorrow is my first day of college and I don't know what to expect. Everything seems really complicated and scary, people seem more mature and harsher and I'm afraid the teachers are gonna be really strict and demanding. I'm scared I won't be able to make any friends or talk to anyone. I'm guessing this is a common feeling so if anyone has already been through this I'd appreciate some advice for my first day. Thanks

"How to deal with someone after an argument?I'm practicing with boundaries. And for me that's also about giving feedback/critism instead of put up with stuff. I still feel anxiety and I don't like the confrontations.After I state a boundary, what sometimes follows is an argument. I'm upfront anxious for that reason. And I'm instantly relieved if that doesn't happen.How to not be a push-over/codependent and be strong and authentic in that situation?Example why I post this:There was a situation that was uncomfortable for me and crossed my boundaries, and instead of getting angry and not saying something about it, I stated my expectations.boundary1: I don't have to put up with that.It became an argument.It became disrespectful.Executed boundary2: I excused me from the conversation, that's where I'm in control.

A lot of the time I got to bed scared that someone won't wake up again so I always have to be the last 'I love you so much' before I go to bed, and I have a therapist but we don't really talk about these things, more about girls being bitchy at school and how I handle that tbh, but I just need advice on how to handle these things and sorry if it doesn't make much sense.

"I have been extremely anxious recently and had two panic attacks yesterday even though I hadn¡¯t had one in a while. Here are two things that really helped me.Look in the mirror. It might sound weird but it really does help me. I think it¡¯s that if you can actually see yourself and see that you are ok that it calms you down.Call a hotline/advice nurse. I don¡¯t know if everyone¡¯s hospital has this but if you call an anxiety hotline or see if you have a line with your healthcare provider that you can talk to during a mental health crisis, CALL THEM. For me it really helped knowing that there is someone I am talking to that understands how to deal with my situation and can give me help. And knowing that someone knows exactly whats happening and knows that you are safe.Holding ice really does help make you focus on something else and really helps when paired with watching a show.

For example, I¡¯ve also found out their reserved, into preservation, dark sense of humour, everyone likes them, both vegetarian, both in the same sort of profession, however for some reason I then need to find something that is different about these two, otherwise it makes me very anxious. Maybe I¡¯m worried of some sort of message to me, or there¡¯s a reason for this for me, or something along those lines. I can¡¯t entirely express why it¡¯s making me anxious¡­ but I¡¯m hoping someone out there who has insight into OCD can offer any advice. Thank you.

"I have been struggling with anxiety since I was a kid. I'm 27 now, and feel like I've made huge progress in controlling and managing it on a daily basis. I would say my daily anxiety is low, but I've noticed when it does flare up, the flares are so much worse than I've ever experienced, almost like they're getting worse progressively. I pretty much can't be without my beta blockers - my blood pressure spikes, my chest hurts and I feel extremely sick until I calm down.Is this normal? Or is my anxiety getting worse overall?

It could be GERD-related but considering that it comes on at random times instead of when I eat contradicts that.I really do just think it's my anxiety messing with me but of course my brain looooooves to go down the rabbit hole and convince me it's actually a brain tumor that is causing my anxiety to go crazy (which I don't believe is even a thing lol)Does anyone else have this?

"Hello, I struggle a lot with self-confidence. Minor flaws seem to outweigh any sense of positives, almost like I don¡¯t ¡°deserve¡± to think higher of myself. I tend to stay inside, and am only happy when I¡¯m working (server) with people I¡¯m incredibly comfortable with. I¡¯ve noticed this trend a LOT in my life. Starting passion projects and stopping when it gets hard, not wanting to go out in fear of judgement, not able to start conversations with strangers, etc. I have been given the advice to try things outside of my comfort zone to gain confidence but everything I think of still seems scary.How do you get over that wall of constant fear? Are there any small things/ideas to start off with to ease into it, or is it only possible to jump into the deep end. Anything helps!

"This really isn¡¯t a question, but I guess I just needed somewhere to express how I¡¯ve been feeling lately. I can¡¯t stop rethinking every single interaction I have with someone lately. For example, I did something relatively small that really made my friend mad yesterday. I apologized several times, but there was nothing I could do to undo what I did. So of course I¡¯m still replaying it in my head today and just giving myself a lot of negative self talk.I¡¯m always just so worried that someone is mad at me, talking bad about me or thinks I¡¯m a terrible or stupid person. It¡¯s incredibly crazy making and has really dwindled my self-esteem. I currently take Zoloft, but I¡¯m not sure it¡¯s helping.In the past I¡¯d go do something active to get my mind off of whatever it was I¡¯d be obsessing over, but it hasn¡¯t helped lately.

Something that connected with me was that anxiety is my body's way of getting my attention that there is another difficult emotion that needs tending to.That emotion is sadness. I've been trying to run away from it. Refused to feel it. Blocking it out. But its necessary for healing. My anxiety translated straight into sadness during the session. And I'm finding it easier to tend to. The sadness is now responding to self love, self hugs, compassion and being okay with the sadness. Its actually a bit of a pleasure to feel it.I guess what I'm trying to say is that, could your anxiety...especially one that isn't a direct response to anything, be disguising whats truly going on?

I¡¯ve had plenty of tests on my heart but I never caught something like this on a holter monitor. I¡¯ve had about 3 of them plus an implantable one. Everytime I have one I can¡¯t seem to have bad symptoms like I have without it (possible anxiety symptom). I posted awhile ago about this but it was so bad today I wanted to post again. I¡¯m a big guy 6¡¯8 230. You can put your hand to my chest and feel the fucked up rhythm. How worried should I be with extensive testing done?

I'm stuck between feeling comfortable yet ""useless"" and being distressed yet ""valuable"". Feeling like this is awful, and I wish I didn't get anxious over even simple things. With no degree, barely any work experience (in my early 20s), and post-ablative hypothyroidism that totally zaps my energy, I'm not very optimistic about opportunities right now. Just wish I didn't feel this way, even with me taking Buspar ?

Been back to immediate care several times and all these doctors seem to think there isn¡¯t anything functionally wrong with my heart.

I have already identified that probably one of the main things I need to do is to stop checking its rate, but this is very hard to do since when I start noticing it, I can feel it beating. Does anyone have any suggestions on dealing with this? I just want to be back to my normal self and the past few months I just haven¡¯t been able to at times

"Sorry in advance if this is a dumb question; but I¡¯ve noticed when it comes to any medication, I always tend to need a stronger dose to feel anything. I¡¯m a fairly big guy (6¡¯2 220) and 5 weeks ago my doc started me on 10mg Prozac. About 2 or so weeks ago he increased that dosage to 20mg. For the first couple weeks he gave me some Ativan to take to get me through my stressful work days. His idea was that I would only need the Ativan until the Prozac kicked in. I¡¯ve been off the Ativan for a couple weeks now and I can generally say I still feel extremely anxious and I¡¯m wondering if I should ask if we can increase the dosage of the Prozac immediately? I haven¡¯t had one bad side effect yet. In fact, I haven¡¯t had any side effects. I¡¯m just wondering if my body possibly needs more of the medication in order for it to work? Thanks in advance

My anxiety stems from an incident that happened where a patient was extremely abusive and confrontational because <e4>the crew didn¡¯t reach them as quick</e4> as the patient would have liked. <e5>We had massive delays</e5> with the demand COVID put on the service, so <e6>we couldn¡¯t get there any faster than we did</e6>.

I¡¯m confident in my job and I know what I¡¯m doing but I get anxious and start stuttering when people are abusive. I want to be good at my job but I can¡¯t seem to move past this one incident. Any suggestions at all are extremely welcome and appreciated.

"A year ago, with plans to meet my friends the next day, I left everything behind. I ghosted everyone. My hometown friends, college friends, outside friends, responsibilities in school, student council, club activities, everything was abandoned. I was hospitalized for a week. For months, I couldn't bear to look at my phone. I ended up getting a new phone to make therapy appointments and take baby steps into the outside world. For a year, the only people I had contact with were a few family members, my therapist, and my psychiatrist. Today, on a whim greatly credited to my therapist, I texted my friend. She was so happy and kind and demanded we meet right now. Even though I'm scared (what do i say? what am i wearing? am i happy? sad? grateful? sorry? how much do i tell?), I'm glad that I'm meeting my friend right away because a) I missed her and b) I can't bear the anxiety of waiting to meet her at a later date.Anyways, I think this might be a significantly bigger¡ªbut still tiny¡ªstep outside.

I¡¯m constantly <e3>nauseous</e3>, <e4>heart pounding</e4>, <e5>shaking</e5>, <e6>sweating</e6>, <e7>overthinking</e7>. I don¡¯t really know why though. My guess is <e8>I¡¯m scared he¡¯s gonna hate me</e8>? But anyway, is anyone dealing w/ something like this? Constant anxiety? I¡¯m in desperate need of grounding techniques.

"I¡¯ve been having the <e1>fear</e1> of a <e2>brain tumor</e2> but my mom looked and I have an infected hair. That was on the left side of my head and now I¡¯m <e3>experiencing the same feelings</e3> on the right side of my head. And I have this faint but false since of forgetting things and being <e4>mad</e4> at more things. So I was wondering if anxiety can give you false symptoms to make these things seem more real? I obviously don¡¯t have anything serious if it¡¯s just an infected hair (maybe on a pinched nerve) causing it
