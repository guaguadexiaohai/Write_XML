"context: i've struggled with depression for a long time, but i've always been able to just keep moving. i had an emotional breakdown in september and have been working with a therapist since. i'm on wellbutrin and clonidine for anxiety and depression, and trazadone for sleeping.lately there have been so many disappointments in my life. <e1>i'm disappointed with people i've trusted and leaned on</e1>, because <e2>they took advantage of me</e2> and <e3>i'm not sure what feelings were even real or not</e3>. i'm disappointed with my job... i was impacted by a restructure in september (straw that broke my back, it wasn't everything by any means... but it definitely triggered it), and have been looking since then. i finally got an offer and started this week, only to find major red flags. i'm trying to get great at pool, but i keep f***ing losing. i know my habits (financial, eating, drinking, being lazy) don't help but i honestly just don't have the energy or motivation to change them. i feel like i'm stuck in a storm.today i had my first day inside an office for over a year as part of my new job. i kept it together during the work day (i also had therapy today which opened a lot of pain, but i shook it off on my way back into the office) and then i had pool/billiards league. i kept it together during both of these, but as soon as i got home i just started balling my eyes out. one of my cats jumped into my shoulders and we both fell, and i just sat there on the ground for like 20 minutes crying.i hate this feeling. i hate the storm that i'm in, and i hate that i can't see past it right now. i'm just so sad about life.","Cause-Effect((e2,e1),(e3,e1))",0,2,1

"obviously we have all been affected by quarantine/covid and like most people it's done a number on my mental health.<e1>i'm typically introverted</e1> but quarantine made me very antisocial and <e2>most days i feel so lonely</e2>. i think that is partly why <e3>i'm engaging with things that i know are gonna upset me</e3>. instead of a positive distraction, i find myself giving myself negative distraction.for example if someone is negative online/they post something offensive or just something i disagree with instead of reading and moving on i find myself clicking the profile and reading more and more. before i know it i'm on 10 different profiles, reading wikipedia pages, and further researching the thing, or just reading some random discourse. it's not even educational or constructive. i just keep gravitating towards negativity instead of taking care of myself or spending my time wisely.i keep finding myself down a rabbit hole of things that are not benefitting me in any way. in the end it leaves me feeling hopeless and unhappy.how do i stop this toxic behavior? how do i focus on positivity? it seems like i can't be left alone with my thoughts but i want to be able to handle being alone without being my biggest enemy.please leave me any tips, videos, book recs, or articles if you have them.","Cause-Effect((e1,e2),(e2,e3))",0,3,1
