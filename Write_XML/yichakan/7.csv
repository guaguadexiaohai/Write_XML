"""disclaimer: this is a long anecdote about my depression more generally, but it places my current regimen into context and i thought some people might enjoy reading my story. edited slightly from a post in r/getting_over_iti'm in my mid 30's. i was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety when i was 21. i have a past filled with physical and emotional trauma. i tried to kill myself numerous times and wound up in the psych ward on 3 separate occasions between 21 and 26. <e1>i've been locked in a cell </e1>because <e2>i was deemed a danger to myself and others</e2>. i've struggled with drug addiction. pretty much boiler plate shit for what a lot of us are dealing with.when i was 26, i chose to check myself into the psych ward for the 3rd time. that was partly informed by the memory, still seared in my mind, of my whole immediate family standing around my hospital bed after i had almost died of a suicide attempt, bereft of words, wondering why. that experience taught me just how much power i have to devastate the people that care about me. i understand that some of you don't have those people and i'm grateful those anchors existed, as light and fragile as   they were. salient in that moment was the idea that my life doesn't just belong to me. even after that experience though, i kept drifting around for awhile, homeless, selling shit to cop drugs to cope with the new reality that suicide was no longer an option. weirdly, when it felt like a viable option in my mind, i felt like i possessed some ultimate form of self-determination. <e3>i no longer had that thing to hold onto</e3>, so <e4>everything about my existence felt out of control</e4>. i had eviscerated all of my personal relationships by that time and my existence rose little further than basic survival.i chose to check myself into a psych ward the last time because my experience in that hospital room haunted me and i felt my only choice was to start living my life again. eight days later i was out and i had been prescribed a med that i thought was working for me - wellbutrin 150mg. i shortly followed up with a dr. when i got out of the hospital, eventually upping the dosage to 450mg a day. it certainly was no cure, but at least it helped me cut back on cigarettes and that small step alone helped build some momentum toward progress. unfortunately, the struggle persisted for years, into and out of suicidality, on and off using, in and out of different living situations. i had at least made enough changes to convince someone to let me live with them while i found a job, which i did. then i finished  my undergraduate degree. then i started really running again. then i went to grad school and got a masters degree with a 3.95 gpa. in spite of the additional student loan debt, achieving those things felt good. they were huge boosts to my self esteem and mental health at the time. i am sure bupropion at least assisted in all that progress. ultimately none of it mattered because i still felt existence was pain, i hated my life and i wanted to die.i had known for a long time that if i was ever going to achieve something approximating mental stability,<e5>i was going to have to do work on a regular basis that felt meaningful to me in some way</e5>, so <e6>i became a teacher</e6>. people had been telling me for years that i would be good at it, but i knew it was a really hard profession with high burnout and people with psych issues tend to struggle. i resisted for awhile, but eventually relented. <e7>i think i realized that i wasn't going anywhere else with my life and i was tired of stagnating as a bicycle mechanic</e7>, so <e8>i got my m.a.t. in 2016 </e8>and <e9>started working as a full-time middle school teacher</e9>. despite acknowledging the meaningful nature of the work i was doing, nothing seemed to pull me up in any significant way from a persistent state of anhedonia, at a minimum, oscillating to and from severe depression.so i resolved to accept that my life was what it was. i had built up a pretty substantial cognitive tool box, out of pure necessity to help me cope with and survive the most difficult periods. i had accepted that happiness is simply not an emotional state that i get to experience. i had accepted that my life would continue to be a protracted series of battles between my conscious self and my brain chemistry and that sucked, but that was fine. i was fine. i had learned how to win those battles most of the time and i could deal with that. i had developed mental strength and resilience. i had an opportunity to do good in this world and in the grand scheme, i knew i was extremely lucky, despite never actually feeling that way.then something unexpected happened.when i moved closer to work, i had to get a new primary care doctor. i found one i thought i would like and he turned out to be awesome. when we got my blood work back, he said that everything looked good, i was quite physically healthy. he then said, """"all we need to do now is get you mentally healthy."""" a friend of his ran a psych practice not far from me and he seriously encouraged me to go talk to them. i told him my hesitation stemmed from only recently having found a place of relative stability and not wanting to upset that in any way. exercise is the most effective anti-depressant i've ever experienced and <e10>i had achieved a decent fitness level</e10> that was totally keeping me afloat at that point, <e11>i didn't want to rock that boat</e11>. he was totally empathetic, though he felt the conversation was worth having.i  found the very worst part of being treated for depression was putting my body through iterations of trying different psych meds, only to wean off and try something else when the first, second and third tries proved ineffective. you all know what i'm talking about. after about 10 years of trying and wreaking havoc on my body through each iteration, bupropion seemed to be the only thing that had any marginal impact. i was convinced psych meds were little more than a key to unlock one's capacity to do the work to get better. i thought they were minimally helpful, but at least a springboard to progress. granted, that was and is still highly significant, but i was disillusioned by the whole concept and frankly a little resentful by then for even having to take meds. fortunately, i trusted my new doctor enough to make an appointment to see the psych. when they said i could maintain my regular bupropion dose, while trying additional meds that weren't contraindicated, i figured it was worth a try. they prescribed me 25mg of lamotrigine daily. i started taking it.it  was about 10 days later when i started noticing unusual things happening in my brain. i would catch myself reacting differently to various events. i would find myself thinking differently about elements of my life. i would find myself taking more joy in the same shit i had been doing all along. i got my runners high back. i could finally, for the first time in my life, really sit back and look at the things i had achieved and appreciate how hard i had worked to get there. it was so obvious that it was working i hardly knew how to react.<e12>i stood in my kitchen one day crying</e12> because <e13>it hit me that it was (is) real</e13>... at first i couldn't believe it. i thought it could only be temporary, that i would build a tolerance and the effect would subside with time. for a few minutes i even questioned reality in toto. i felt like i was cheating. then i realized the only thing happening was i was seizing control of my mind. practically overnight, all those tools in my cognitive toolbox became 10 times more effective and 10 times less necessary.""

"""so this might be a bit of an unusual post.i've been playing guitar for around 16 years.i've definitely never been anywhere near as good as i should be for that length of time, but i was a good guitarist and felt very comfortable playing and mostly had developed my own style and didn't really work on anything outside of it.over the last 5 years my mental health has been awful, with episode of depression after episode of depression, and a year long stint of intense depersonalisation disorder. i completely lost passion for music, along with everything else, and my creative output slowed to a near halt, not to mention having very strong suicidal thoughts and urges every waking moment.but while depression killed my enjoyment of music and my ability to write, the whole time i could still play at roughly my usual level, though maybe a little slowed down.over the last year and <e1>a half in particular was probably the nastiest episode of depression</e1> and <e2>i finally bit the bullet and started trying medications</e2>, (i had been terrified of them up until then) which was another awful journey with far more failures than successes, but a few months ago i got it somewhat sorted after trying so many different meds. now i am just on seroquel and have experienced some level of recovery in my mood and my suicidal thoughts have reduced dramatically, though my  motivation and interest in music, or anything really, is still pretty low.anyway, to the point, around 6 months ago, while still messing around with medication and not yet experiencing much relief, something started to change pretty suddenly. my ability to play the guitar was disappearing. my hands felt uncomfortable and awkward on the guitar, my fretting hand thumb didn't seem to feel right in any position, my hands were falling out of sync, i couldn't find the right grip on my pick and my picking hand in general felt clumsy, weak and slow. trying to alternate pick i   couldn't consistently pass the pick across the string, it would catch. in general, my skill just felt like it evaporated very suddenly. additionally i started feeling dumber in general, my brain feels more switched off and i regularly find myself unable to find the word i am looking for. this was a huge blow to me and along with my lacking enjoyment in music made me feel like maybe i was just done with music, which was devastating after devoting so much of my life to this.as <e3>my mental health has been doing a bit better now</e3>, <e4>i've been trying to start from the beginning and practice daily and relearn everything</e4>, but it is honestly not going smoothly. i've managed to get my hands feeling comfortable a few times and get some semblance of my ability back, but it just isn't consistent. every day is a roll of the dice as to whether it all goes out the window again.i'll practice for hours  and get some basic exercises sounding right, then i try to play something i used  to comfortably be able to play and it all goes to shit again.i'm feeling lost and incredibly disheartened.i feel like something in my brain has slipped out of wack and i'm trying to get things to click again.i wanted to know if anyone else has experienced a drop off like this before in something they were good at and if there was anything that helped them?thanks""

(mainly chicken liver/heart/stomach, also love tongue and marrow).  avoid all bread/grains/starches/starchy vegetables (potatoes etc). try to maximize my leafy greens intake, kale, spinach etc. berries, but none or little fruit. when it comes to protein; low mercury fish (cod and it's relatives, wild salmon, mackarel, atlantic mackerel, herring, shrimp and mussels). mussels are great, but buy fresh and not canned (since canned has bisphenol-a in the lining). also try to eat fermented foods daily. saurkreut (non pasteurized, can be made simply at home), kimchi, natto, aged cheese, home made kefir etc. i do not use any low quality refined oils. extra virgin olive oil, cold pressed flax-seed oil, avocado oil, cold pressed rapeseed oil are fine for salads (since has ok omega-3/omega-6 ratios). usually try to get my fats from whole foods though, nuts are great vegetable source. also has been chewing a lot of hemp seeds lately (great source of fibre, also has an almost optimal omega-3/omega-6 ratio, ala (the form of omega-3 found in plants) is probably not enough though, epa/dpa from fatty fish or as supplement is a much safer option).daily supplements: (those with an asterisk (*) i am less certain of really has a significant effect, but <e5>i keep taking them either</e5> because <e6>they are cheap</e6>, <e7>has other health benifits, or dare not stop fearing</e7> that if i change too much of my current regime i will relapse).ashwagandha (life extension, sensoril), has been absolutely crucial for treating my gad/anxiety.omega-3 (important to choose a high quality supplement with low contaminants/oxidization)*turmeric/curcimin important to research which supplements has high bioavailability if taking as supplement, i use the fresh root simmered with coconut oil/milk and taken with pirpirine)*tmg (for methylation, cheaper alternative to same, not sure as effective, but right now i feel good enough that do no have to take it. still take tmg since it's cheap, has other health benefits, and possibly has some of the effects of same.)*nac, pretty cheap supplement, have in some studies show to be beneficial for mental issues.*taurine""

and future starting right in the morning when i open my eyes. otherwise: huge lack of drive/motivation, anhedonia (lack of interests, almost nothing that stimulates me), lethargy, feelings of extremely painful inner emptiness and restlessness (hard to explain but somehow as being alive in a dead body or being buried alive without being able to do anything against it), cognitive decline (focus, memory, access to thoughts) body pain (makes it hard to stand, sit straight, walk, keeping body posture and walk stairs), typical symptoms of social anxiety etc.medication: i tried 10 different medications until now. 8 antidepressant, 2 neuroleptics: venlafaxine (trevilor), escitalopram (cipralex), sertraline (zoloft), paroxetine (paxil), duloxetine (cymbalta), opipramol, moclobemide (aurorix) and seroquel (quetiapine), promethazine. none worked, none gave me any effect at all except for side effects, sexual ones etc.conversational therapy: i had 2 depth psychological therapies. no success. right now i'm in a behavorial therapy. the therapist is quite good but i never have much to add or feelings of new enlightenments. makes me think my depression is mainly biological/neurological. could be.i discovered alcohol in the age of 15, a substance that improves mood just by drinking some liquid, damn, a wow! effect. with 17 i started drinking daily, first only in the evenings to kill negative thoughts, be able to enjoy life and sleep. with the time i began drinking in the mornings and before events especially social ones but somehow for everything: sports, seeing natives, seeing friends, before school, then before university and so on. imagine being drunk everywhere, sitting buzzed out in school, in lectures of university, playing tennis drunk, sitting drunk at the table with your mother and brother without anyone else knowing you're drunk. i drank almost everything, beer, wine but mainly hard stuff like vodka for the odor. and i still don't know why but no one ever noticed anything about me being buzzed to drunk all day. i had trained my techniques, drinking vodka, then eating garlic, gum, just putting anything with strong odor for example sauces in my mouth burbling and consuming it. then a hot shower with a lot of shampoo and brushing my teeth with a lot of toothpaste. now i was ready for the day, dumbed and buzzed out but therefor less negative thoughts and more good mood and ability to talk, socialize and be funny. <e1>alcohol seemed like a godsend for me</e1>, <e2>it was my antidepressant and anxiolytic. what a dumb therapy</e2>, i didn't think about it in the beginning, some day i recognized how dumb it was but <e3>i didn't care as everything, every addiction</e3>, every physiological damage i was doing myself, <e4>was better than feeling the psychological pain i would experience being sober</e4>. i drank mostly daily until i was 19, then i <e5>lost my driving licencse</e5> because of <e6>course drinking</e6> that often alcohol was almost always in my blood. it was late night, the morning after i directly quit cold turkey and never began drinking alcohol since ever. nowadays i can't even drink alcohol anymore, i tried as society (friends, family, just social events) kind of forces one to, but i can't enjoy it, it just directly gives me headache, (strangely for alcohol but) bad mood, tiredness and very psychological and physiological unpleasantness in general. this occurs right after one or two sips. kind of sad, i think sometimes, but probably the best thing for me and my health.with 20 i discovered phenibut, oh yeah. first i was sticking to the very important rule only consuming it twice a week. then as i went back to university i couldn't stand not being able to socialize again, i wanted to talk to people, make friends, meet girls, be able to impress people and not be branded as the shy, silent, not interesting at all boy in university. it was not only about impressing them but also myself as being this psychologically disabled boy made me very depressive and sad. another thing was my <e7>disabled cognition</e7> due to <e8>depression</e8>. before phenibut i sat in universiy and didn't understand a thing, i was socially anxious and panicful all the time. i spent much more attention to what this person 3 rows in front of me thinks about me, what the girl sitting 6 rows behind me would think about how i sat, when i would cough or give a strange sound from me. thanks to phenibut i didn't care, i could focus on the topics, not on the people around me and what they could think about me (even if they don't care anyways, it was very paranoid and irrational thinking). i had the greatest idea, creativity and funny jokes on my mind. i participated a lot in the lectures, group work and projects. i was very social, the people told me i was the most social person they met and that i should stay like this, never change as i was very friendly, funny, even integrating social outcasts or people with mental issues like depression, social anxiety or even asperer. i wanted the best for everyone and tried my best to give people a good life and confidence as i knew how bad it was for me before phenibut and now i was able to gift people. well phenibut made me kind of hypomanic as you could imagine. i had the feeling i could do anything, life was amazing, life was heaven. i never worried at all, i was happy all the time. i had great perspectives and ideas all the time. future was safe for me. i could speak with every person, doesn't matter which age, gender or whatever. i could just go to a girl and flirt with her, change numbers, take her home at partys. i had so many dates, met so many different people and girls. did so many different things, tried new hobbys, political thinking and engagement, positive thoughts about future jobs, social life etc. everything worked. what should i have worried about. sure, also phenibut lost its magic after a year. i struggled with withdrawal for a month very hard. it's no joke at all, it was in comparison to the heaven i experienced on phenibut, a total hell. i experienced a feeling of inner emptiness and restlessness that i wouldn't wish my worst enemy. it was not bearable in these moments that came like for periods of 30mins during the day. there was nothing i could do to against during this pain of hell. very hard to describe but believe me intense torture without knowing what or where it was coming from or hitting you.today i'm still studying luckily, i didn't give up but i was very close to. but depression and all these symptoms in the first paragraph are strongly present. future anxiety is big. what should life bring me being depressive, bad mood, kind of dumb, disabled in thinking and cognition, not being able to socialize or talk. how should i ever manage a job like this, find some people i'm able love and people that love me. how should i find joy in life when nothing stimulates me, nothing interest me, nothing gives me joy? i feel very dumb, disabled, hope- and perspectiveless and bad mood all the time. additionally many moments are filled with deep psychological pain and inner emptiness or restlessness. life is a torture but there still is a little spark of hope somewhere. otherwise i wouldn't continue studying (even if with very bad cognition and not a lot of success) and sometimes socialize (even if after social events i feel very disappointed of myself). <e9>i also have a sidejob since 2 months which works quite well</e9> and <e10>gives me good feelings about myself</e10>. on days i work i feel slightly better.if you read until here i want to thank you so much for """"hearing"""" me. i would love to read about your experiences, assumptions, suggestions or tips. according therapy, medication, cogntive/behavioral paterns and so on.i want to try a new medication (as i already tried 10, see second paragraph) now in december, i already talked with my doc about it. i also tried almost every supplement there is in the world and many nootropics. my therapy seems quite therapy resistent at least according that what i tried. as i already said i think my depression is mainly biological. <e11>i don't know if it always have been like this</e11> as <e12>the alcohol could have fucked my brain much too</e12>. in my depth psychological therapy i also learned that my older brother played a big role in messing me and my thought patterns up. i don't want to give him the fault but it makes a lot of sense as he really harmed me psychologically and sometimes physiolgoically and when a thing like this happens daily sure your brain and thought patterns change withit too and not in the positive way. additionally i grew up with my mother and brother alone, father was not there since i was 4. my mother allowed us everything and was a everything-going-to-be-great speaker. maybe the austerity and inurement from the father was missing. otherwise i was very not-resilient and socially anxious since i was a small child. again: that's why i think the origin/source is biological. i also think the depression arised out my social anxiety and weak resiliance.""
