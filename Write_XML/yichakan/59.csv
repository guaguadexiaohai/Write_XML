"<e1>This is my first post</e1>, so <e2>excuse me if it seems clumsy or jumpy, I'm slightly intimidated</e2>. I've been in a state of depression ever since I could remember. It started out being from chronic bullying (physically) and being molested, to alcoholic tendencies my mother had which affected me greatly. As of recently, I've had other emotional issues dealing with my relationships with others (a female in particular) and accepting that this is how things are. I had just turned 15 yesterday, not really feeling anything special, and it just felt like a regular day. Unsurprisingly enough, my mood has swung to an extremely depressed state and isolation has started to occur. My ways of coping aren't healthy and I'm worried for my own mental and emotional health. I don't have much hope left in me and I guess that's what I wanted to express. I'd love to hear your stories and feedback as well, thank you for your time.

So now I have an interview scheduled for the end of this week, I feel like I am all over the place with my anxiety and its been hard to manage with all the changes. I have been trying to cope but it's just getting exhausting and having interview after interview is just getting worse not better. Does anyone have any tips so that I can not seem so nervous during these interviews?

About 2 months ago the leader decided to take it all back. I was scum to her. and she forced everyone to treat me as such or face the same treatment. I was banned, and shunned, told every encouraging word was a lie. now.. idk. i dont see a light at the end of this tunnel. i never figured out what i did wrong. i lost all my friends when she did it, most of my family when i came out.

There was no real reason for it though. There's still a ton of games I want to play like Dark Souls 3, Tomb Raider 2, Dishonored 2, etc so it's not a lack of interest.  I'm afraid I'll get into gaming again one day and get stuck in it. I never really had to struggle to quit, it wasnt a conscious decision. It was maybe a year before I realized I didnt do any gaming.

"One of my best friends has been increasingly isolating herself the last few months from her friends . Turns out she joined an internet cult and has been having an affair with a guy from there . This is not my circus, not my monkeys, but I am feeling massively triggered. Other than the particulars, her recent behavior (hyper sexuality, isolating from previous friends, 'anywhere but here' mentality) is a scary echo of my last major manic episode. She won't contact anyone or answer calls or texts. Her mom is bipolar I  schizoaffective and it's clear to me she is, also. She's also at the right age for a first major manic episode. Basically I am feeling massive anxiety, helplessness, and anger at her - even though I know it's probably the mania riding her. Has anyone else been through this? I'm really depressed about losing my friend but also relieved I am pretty much out of the blast radius here. I've walked her husband through some of BP and how it can explain her behavior. Otherwise, there's nothing I can do but obsess and wish I had my friend back. :-

I personally have so many, last year i went on a ski trip with my school and my sixth form friends all came, out of 17 years of living it was the best week of my entire life without a doubt. but because of <e2>it</e2>, <e1>i cant listen to a few songs</e1>.. I want it that way - backstreet boys. This song just makes me cry, i just think of all the good times and how shit life is now and i cant cope.  But please comment what song(s) set you off and what memory (if you want to share) Mine:Backstreet Boys - I Want It That Way  Flashback of best week of my life.

"I am an 18 year old senior, Prom day aproaches within the week and <e1>it feels me with an emptiness and sadness</e1>, not just because <e2>I'm alone</e2>  but that <e3>I see happiness I cannot afford, I feel only a sadness in my life and empathy for people</e3> . I have decided to end my life on Prom night somewhere nobody will ever think to look, I want people to keep hope that I will be alive somewhere instead of knowing the ugly truth of my death, my family would be darkened if they knew what really happened. Friends would blame themselves for my death and may attempt suicide, no one is to blame but myself for the actions I cause upon my life, not the people who knew me. I have written down notes and his them around my city, I hope they will understand once the pieces are brought together and I apologize for my idiotic decisions.

"I don't expect much replies or for anyone to care really. I've been through hell ever since I was young and it's finally caught up to me. I have no friends. I have no family who cares. I have no home. And I've recently lost the one person who I loved. She has started to hate me and I can't stand being alone anymore. I've been different ever since I can remember. Always putting myself down never really feeling happy. I felt a brief moment of happiness when I met a girl who I thought was the one. Everything seemed better. I was happy I had someone to talk to, I had someone who accepted me and understood me. Then I lost my home. I was unhappy again and sadly took some of that out on her. She now hates me. I've stopped all intake of water or any fluids for three days. I can feel it making me weaker, and headaches constantly. I'm afraid of hurting those that do care, but I don't want to be here anymore.

"So I've basically been in a relationship from like 2013-January of this year (different relationships but they were one after the other). I ALMOST ended up in another relationship this month and although I like the person and all that jazz, I know I'm not ready and I'd only be using the person to distract me from the things I need to work on. I was very transparent with him and told him the reasons why I need to keep things casual and just be by myself for a while and he was very understanding.   Currently I have no FP.  It's weird. But not the end of the world. Hooray for me. ^ _ ^ Side note: Mysteryland 2017 just got canceled and I'm preeeeeeetty broken up about it but I'm gonna deal and I'll be okay.  Hope everyone is doing okay and having a happy Easter!

"Mistake 1. So I left my job without any notice a few months ago. I completely ghosted them. Mistake 2. I put down my campuses address for them to send my W-2 info, and I didn't pick it up in time. Mistake 3. Now I've waited until the last second to get my W-2 and I have to face the people I completely dropped to get it.I feel like the only solution is to go and face them and try my best to come up with a reason for leaving out of the blue. Is there another option?

"When I was a kid, <e1>I used to like holidays</e1> . <e2>I used to like seeing my cousins, and extended family, and do the typical holiday activities</e2> . But ever since I went into the military, and seeing pictures of everyone having a good time, I became jealous, and <e3>I hated to see everyone happy as I ate my crappy cold meal while I was surrounded by assholes</e3> .  Even though I'm done with my several years in the military, <e4>I still hate holidays</e4> , and I choose to remain alone and eat a crappy meal by myself. Am I the only one who has these weird feelings and desires? Or can I just blame it on some made up disease?

"This is kind of an odd post, but i felt the need too write it for whatever reason. This last month or two has been especially hard on me, but one thing that i noticed is that my dog has been way more attached too me lately. I live with my parents and we have an 11 year old great dane which is very old for a dane, but he's still going on. He doesnt do much other than just lay in my parents room and eat and go outside like two-three times a day. However these last couple of weeks I've been really sad about certain things, and spending most of my time in my room, and my dog who would not usually come downstairs due too his bad legs will come and want too be petted and will lay down next too me, or if my door is closed he'll either try too open it or lay down right next too it. I don't really know for a fact that my dog knows that it's been especially rough these last few weeks but it was just an odd coincidence that i noticed.

"<e1>And they don't treat me like I'm crazy</e1> because of <e2>all the shit that's gone on</e2>. They keep trying to play with me and cheer me up and it's sort of cool but I can only play for a few seconds before I get depressed and just want to be left alone. Kids are the only people I can smile at anymore. Kids are masters of forgiveness. They see someone is sad or having a hard time and they don't perpetuate it by being shitty to them. Or by completely ignoring them. I also drank wine and I shouldn't have but I'm gonna try not to get smashed and make an ass of myself

"Looks like there are many more people reading here today than usual. Is Easter a tough holiday for people? It's giving me some trouble. Remembering happier and more carefree days. Not helping with the suicidal ideation. I understand that some feel that their life has never been ok. For me it is a double edged sword that I feel at one times things were at least better, even if still not ideal. I remember that it's possible to be happier but it is a painful contrast and something that will never return.

"Does anyone else have difficulty transitioning to sex when it's initiated by your partner? What have you done to address the issue? If (on the odd occassion) I initiate sex, everything is great and I can maintain focus. If my boyfriend initiates sex while I'm in the middle of something (and because <e1>my brain is always going</e1> , <e2>I am effectively always in the middle of something</e2> ), <e3>I am liable to turn him down outright or give up midway</e3>  because <e4>I can't get into it *at all*</e4> . <e5>I'm seriously considering scheduling sex each week</e5> because <e6>it's the only way I'll have enough time to prepare</e6>.

"Hi everyone! I've been struggling with dpdr for around 2 years now. Started <e1>when I was 14 from a weed induced panic attack and hasn't got better since</e1> . <e2>My memory is severely stunted and I can't remember my old life and what it feels like to be normal anymore</e2>  :(One of my main symptoms is total apathy. I can't envision a future with me in it and find planning really really hard. When I wasn't experiencing dpdr I used to get nervous over test results, parents fighting, sudden stopping in cars etc. I never feel nervous anymore, my future is going down the drain and i cant find a fuck to give. I had to break up a fist fight like two months ago and I felt the fight or flight adrenaline nervousness and it felt so good! I felt alive again. I just want to get some feeling back :(
