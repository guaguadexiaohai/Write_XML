"Hey Reddit. I have finally been able to tell that at long last I am treating my anxiety and depression. \ The problem is many of those I have told seem to think that it is one singular thing that is causing it, yet even I can not pinpoint what causes it.  The problem is, I still get these low points, where I just feel down and don't really know what to do. I would like to talk about it with those I care about, but I feel that they would just ask me what it is that is making me feel like that, and I would feel as though I am telling them because I want attention, and I hate that feeling. How do those out there that are able to be open about this manage to get through those anxious feelings and talk to those close to you about it.

Hey guys just looking for advice on how to act or do regarding one of my co-workers. We used to get along but then she started talking behind my back all the time and figured out I have anxiety.  So when I'm sitting down at my cubicle I tend to just focus on my work and ignore what's going on around me. Maybe this co-worker thinks I'm ignoring her when she comes around to talk to other people. She usually never greets me. But yesterday I said morning then <e1>she says something like I'm so annoying</e1> and she can't stand me while I was talking to someone else. Anyways this <e2>made me feel terrible</e2> the whole day. She makes work so awkward for me so I don't know how to act towards her. ,"Cause-Effect((e1,e2))",1,0,1
