"One of my friends drank some codeine he was prescribed to for bronchitis, the next morning went in the bathroom while getting ready for work and did some heroin. He told his gf (one of my good friends who lives with him) that he didn't feel well and had to lay down. He made really weird noises, not vomiting or anything, and then just stopped breathing. His gf called 911, then used narcan on him and it did nothing. She lives in a downtown area, EMT's were there almost instantly, he received 2 more doses of narcan and again nothing.

"Wednesday is usually wine down Wednesday w/ my girlfriend at my place. Past Wednesdays it was usually 1-2 bottles of wine (much of that damage my doing), dinner, pass out on the couch or stumble into bed, wake up late for work, rush to get into the office on time. Last night, we still had the same conversations, same dinner, same amount of fun, just while drinking unsweet tea.

"I think one of the worst things about anxiety, for me anyway, is apathy as a defense mechanism. It's adjacent to depression, but not quite. I'm totally functional and even jovial at times. I just don't really care about much, or at least I don't feel passionate about things. Sometimes one of these ruts lasts for just a few days, and sometimes much, much longer. It's like my brain shuts down all strong feeling as a defense mechanism to curb anxiety. Anyway, all is well, I was just wondering if other people have experienced the same thing and if so, how you've dealt with it.
