"""i worked very hard for a long time. in 2017, i decided to stay sober and focus on being responsible, volunteering, improving myself. nine months later some teenager hit me with his car (no trial, no jail time), shattered 13 of my bones, and ruined the sensation in my right hand. a year and about 100 pt sessions later, my mom was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, which has now become a glioblastoma; shes immobile and can barely speak. this diagnosis came less than six months after she retired.over the past four years, my dog died; my ex  only person ive ever loved  married someone far more handsome and richer than me; i lost my job as covid hit, despite making so many sacrifices; and now im living at home, over 30, my mothers caretaker. i think im also becoming an alcoholic.i dont want to travel. i dont want to fall in love. i dont want a pet. i dont want a good job. i dont want a nice apartment. i dont want to meet new people. i just want this all to end.""
