"So I've begun to notice that when I'm dissociating I smile a lot and can't talk. Or so people tell me. When I'm alone and dissociating though (or even when I'm not alone) I find my facial expressions change randomly on their own. My mouth and chin twitchs. I go from having a scrunched up, scared face to having a completely relaxed one. Or a sad one. Or angry occasionaly. And they cycle. Usually spend more in the blank state though. It's very weird and I didn't really think much of it until recently. I guess I'm becoming more aware? Idk. Anyone else have this? Also. The flashbacks part (I think?)Sometimes when I have flashbacks I talk to myself. But not really. It's like there are multiple people. But it's not completely me. For example, I had one a few hours ago. I don't remember much about the context and idk the trigger either. But there was one part of me almost that didn't feel like me. It was crying and talking to me. Then it'd switch to me.

"My intention was to go to sleep 1 hour ago to wake up to do something exciting in the morning. I came across a channel with really funny videos and I'm watching them right now. This happens to me all the time. It seems like I get lost in whatever I'm doing so much that I overdo it and everything else becomes less significant. I don't know anyone who goes the extra mile more than me on something enjoyable. I overdo things. I eat too much food if I'm liking it. I work too much if I'm doing well. I compete really hard. I get excited quickly if I'm not controlling it. I love too much. I hate too much. This works in my favor if I'm positive and friendly, otherwise it doesn't work in my favor as you can imagine. I'm curious if there is some kind of method related to ADHD to manage this thing.

The thing is that for the past year or so, my brain has been bombarding me with negative thoughts which suck my will to enjoy life. Only recently did I research this (as the condition has worsened) and found out about intrusive thought and OCD. However, in all discussion I've seen about it, it seems like the intrusive thoughts haunting people are violent or anti-social. Is this really a prerequisite for them to be considered intrusive thoughts rather than something else? The thoughts which I've been struggling with have not been inherently antisocial, nor do they directly compel me to do anything, it's just mainly some negative experiences and feelings constantly popping up in my mind and preventing me from enjoying anything, and being unable to shake them off despite going in circles around them over and over again.

Maybe that's bc I was one of the two heaviest drinkers in the group??  Last night there was wine there, but I brought a bunch of waters and delish cheese and chocolates that were super satisfying.

"Okay so TLDR; I'm bedridden paralyzed in fear from the SA, isolating for 4-5 years, trips to family orngrocery are hellllll for me. No friends. In short I have SA alike the worst sufferer on Earth. After intense intense driving in my car and going to therapy; 2 different ones suggested i go with psychiatry and get medicated. But... I'm afraid this is just throwing a pill at someone with broken legs who can't sprint, that only takes away the pain - helps short term, worse long term. Doesn't big pharmaceutical want us hooked? Was just prescribed Attivan, anyone have experiences with it? So far seems to bring on depression for me with little effects to the SA paranoia and freezing reactions.

They have also tested him for any empathy related issue and found nothing out of the normal. They have explained his conduct changing as normal of a kid with his disorder. Good news is that they also host a summer camp for kids and I have signed him up and he seems to be very excited about it. They will learn to deal with frustration and raise their self-esteem.
