"I feel fed up. Normally I'm not this angry but fuck it. After spending so many years trying to do well in school, be a good person, a good worker, a good wife, I feel it's all bullshit. Nobody cares about anyone but themselves. People offer you advice but really it's just self aggrandizing and makes them feel better about themselves. People want to be better, and some are so shitty that they'll abuse others at their own expense. We ignore the people who need the most help, the most hurt, ignored, gentle people. And glorify the shitheads who take our money in the name of some political or religious endeavor when really they're just sociopath types who don't give a fuck about anyone.  We put on airs and pretend we have this fucking life figured out when we're just evolved mammals on this billions of year old rock making up stupid shit and stories about God and what's real. None of it is real, love exists if we choose to believe it in our minds, no one is coming to save us. Even philosophy seems like a waste of time. What's the point?

"Lately, I have been seeing a lot of comments here <e1>about how children cannot have bipolar disorder. That is not what recent research and practice supports.</e1> In fact, in the past 10 years there has been a huge leap forward in understanding that children DO get bipolar disorder and simply display symptoms differently than many adults do. Many kids rapid cycle and/or have mixed states. Few have euphoric mania, though some do.My son is 8, has bipolar disorder, and is in a study at NIH where they are examining MRI's related to early onset bipolar.So please, <e2>before you diagnose (or contradict a diagnosis) related to bipolar disorder in children....STOP</e2>.

"i've felt like this since i was a little kid. like every moment i'm still alive is taking time away from someone else. like i don't deserve to be here and all i do is waste valuable resources without contributing anything at all. like i'm a black hole that just keeps sucking up stuff and sucking up stuff and sapping all the good out of the worldi feel like everything i have would be better as someone else's, but i'm too selfish to give anything away.i just want everything to stop. i don't know if i really want to be dead or not. mostly, i just want to go to sleep forever. i want to be able to sleep forever, but also be able to wake up any time and go on with life. maybe i just want the option of making it permanent while being able to back out any time. like i could wake up if i wanted, but i could also just sleep forever too.i don't know if this is suicidal thinking or just being really tired of being alive.

"<e1>Whenever I hear sadness called something to do with diet or amount of sleep it really ticks me off</e1> because <e2>it is so belittling to somebody trying deal with depression</e2>. It makes our problems sound so small as if we just caught a cold and someone tells us we should dress warmer. Like they believe it's a tiny irk with an easy fix. It's not. It's crippling and life threatening. It just shows that there's a grand confusion about what depression is by people who don't suffer from it. They don't understand what we go through but they act as if they know all the solutions we need. I just feel so much animosity for the total lack of help available to us. But you probably know about this already cause you're awesome. Thanks for reading.

"Hi.So, I'm like a closet-depressed person. I have certain triggers that will hit me, and once they do, I get so far down you'd need a super drill to find me again. Today is one of those days - *and it's not an appropriate one*. I've recently hit a happy period of my life, and met someone that now matters a lot to me. I'm not yet ready to introduce this person to the dark hole that is my depression. I realize it's going to have to happen some day, but I'm not ready to have that day come this week. So I need to keep a positive outlook and not appear as broken as I feel.What do you guys do to get momentarily over your depression in order to function in your day to day life? I cannot figure this out right now on my own, and I **need** this sorted out asap.

"Hi so I was just recently (like the other day) diagnosed with ADHD. <e1>I'm on Concerta (I think 27mg) the reason I don't know what I'm taking at the moment</e1> is because <e2>my parents have to hide the medicine bottles on me</e2> (OD on prozac in beginning of Sept) and I have only been taking it for a day so I haven't gotten the chance to look at the dosage and to be honest I totally forgot what the doctor was saying. Anyways, I'm just wondering how long Concerta takes to kick in. I felt dizzy, and basically loopy all day. (I almost passed out in a comic shop...)I really didn't get any work done (had a bunch of hw building up). I'm also on 125mg of Lamictal (Lamotrigine) and 200mg of Seroquel. (I have bi-polar and anxiety too.) I'm going to talk to my doctor on Monday since the office is closed this weekend. I so far don't like how I was feeling. But should I give it more time since it was only the first day of Concerta? I'm just a little worried it's reacting to my other medication badly

Do any of you agree with this interpretation? Are there any other similar characters you can think of from TV/movies who are like this?

"Today is different. I suppose it started last night - Instead of the typical feeling of anxiety that comes before bed, it was loneliness. I just felt so alone and pathetic. Waking up today was only worse. Bad stomach problems and such self loathing that Ive spent the day in tears thus far. Through all the confused fragmented imagery of my own despair, these memories that I spent years pushing down are all coming back up. The things that made me happy, the things that made me sad, the bad shit ive done to people - the bad shit ive done to myself. Its like listening to a radio static between stations, and every once in awhile I get a clear signal. It flickers, reminds me of something that I have been running from for so long, and then goes back to static. Just long enough to plant an image in my head... something beautiful and horrific. I dont hate the memories though. I hate that I dont know how to cope with them.I am so thankful to have Leaves to reflect on. You guys are keeping me square.

"Hey guys.I was diagnosed quite recently with ADHD and intense anxiety. After a prolonged episode last year, I decided to use all my energy to build my focus. Fortunately I can afford to see a good therapist. He and I see eye-to-eye where medication is concerned and he uses it in very minimal amounts. However I have faced constant failures where attention and memory are concerned. It's a circle of starting something - forgetting why I started itlosing purpose or meaning in doing it - getting distracted and on and on. But I am not resigned to it just yet. I was hoping if you guys could tell me the ways in which, barring medication, you try to improve your concentration and your memory. Exercises, particular kinds of meditation, even just doing math problems. Anything at all.

"I've never tried Strattera (Only Vyvanse ; Adderall XR) but I've heard both good and bad things about it. People commonly mention that they deal with excessive sleepiness or loss of libido but I'm a little bit confused about how the sleepiness is induced. Strattera aka atomoxetine is an NRI but it's unique mechanism of action has it primarily acting in the brain rather than the periphery. As we know, norepinephrine is a stimulating catecholamine which is derived from dopamine and can be converted one step further to epinephrine. So wouldn't the theory be that increased norepinephrine levels promote vigilance, wakefulness, alertness, memory formation etc? I know I'm waay oversimplifying this med, but bear with me.

Hiding vodka in the kitchen and making mixed drinks throughout the evening. I'm getting through 1/3 to 1/2 a bottle a night. It is not good. Some days, I work from home and go out for lunch and have a beer or two or 3. My weight is creeping up. This morning I woke up, and said to myself - today is day 1. I can't do this anymore - for myself or for my wife and our daughter growing inside her. Today it starts. I'm thinking about taking a walk up to AA this afternoon, just to sit and observe and see if it's for me. Today...I won't drink

But strangely you've accomplished your goal, and here you are either laughing about how stupid what you're doing is or feeling hopeful for a breakthrough.Regardless, that is apparently how neural pathways work. You need to reinforce them. There is NO EASIER way to break down successes into miniscule chunks until they become large enough to have an impact on your life.

I made it until mid November, then relapsed for a good 9 months. First just a few days a week, but then the holidays came and whaddayaknow every night there was a bottle in my hand. The result? Addled brains, hungover mornings, bloated, rotten attitude, guilt and shame - the old demons were back. So here we go again. This time it already feels much easier to be vigilant. I'm grateful for all the wisdom in this sub. Browsing each morning really helps. Thanks for listening :)p.s. get yourself a co2 tank and you'll have an endless amount of bubbly water

We essentially develop four speeches throughout the semester, each one differing in the topic and impact of said speech. Today in class the teacher urged us to design our next speech to enlighten the class about a topic that causes problems in an individual's life. At first he provided basic examples; divorce, death in a family, etc. Eventually he mentioned Agoraphobia, of which only a handful of us had actually heard of (I personally have seen people mention the fear and have known the general definition of it but that is the extent of my knowledge on the subject). He explained what it was, and a girl in front of me brutally bashed Agoraphobia and found it to be, the most ridiculous and obnoxious thing that people who have too much time on their hands have made up"".

I feel so clear, so awake and full of energy.  n  nIf some of you struggle with mornings and you smoke, I would definitely try abstaining.

"Sooo I'm seeing an occupational therapist for other reasons, and she mentioned ADHD be a coping strategy my mind developed to deal with lack of attention as a kid? Or rather that that could be one factor in how it developed.I've never heard of this before, and frankly I'm not sold on it. There's a lot of comping strategies, depression, narcissism, anger, etc etc pp, but I've never seen or heard ADHD as one. Perfectionism, which is not a stranger to many with ADHD, is considered a coping strategy too. But ADHD itself? Guess at this point I'm trying to figure out what to think of this. For now I'll leave out other details from the session to keep the discussion open and broad. Edit to point out that this is not asking for coping strategies *for* ADHD.

Citalopram 20mg to be precise, as of three days ago.Sadly I developed some kind of reaction and collapsed in the street yesterday and was apparently convulsing. Prior to this I had severe sweating, confusion/agitation, muscle spasming, visual problems, nausea/vomiting/squits, and difficulty walking/staying up-right. I had to try and walk to the hospital but sadly didn't make it. The doctors are saying it is some kind of reaction to serotonin toxicity potentially something called serotonin syndrome. <e1>I was really out of it</e1> so <e2>I'm not sure exactly.I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this</e2> and how long I may have to wait before it wears off?

I've been having anger issues ever since I was a kid, but these days as a near-adult I've been experiencing unreasonable outrages.

It only lasts about 20 seconds total, but sometimes after the session I feel like I would breakdown. <e1>This happens after playing online games, whenever lag shows up at very inopportune moments, happening repeatedly over the course of a play-session.I don't think lag could ever have that effect on anybody</e1>, so <e2>I think that the reason is emotional or psychological in nature</e2>.

"Hey Internet,nI've been having a bit of a problem for a while now. Whenever my parents say something to me that I...diskike, my first reaction is to snap at them and to become dramatic. I already have established that there is a lot of anger and self-loathing involved, but the problem is, I don't realize just how bad my voice sounds to other people when I do it, and I'm worried that I do it to others. <e1>My parents do the same to me</e1>, so <e2>I think I learned it from them</e2>, but my question is...how do you catch yourself snapping at people, and how do you correct it?

"I feel like I'm stuck. My son's father constantly puts me down and screams at me. I feel lower than dirt and he makes me wanna just kill myself, take the easy way out. The only thing that keeps me from going through with it is my 5 year old son. He needs me and loves me so much. Also, my mother has lost a child before. The thought of putting her through that pain again kills me. In the back of my head I tell myself things will get easier for them over time. I know suicide is selfish but I hate myself and apparently I'm just garbage.

"I'm on a gay cruise all by myself. I feel really lonely. I met one guy who was really nice at first and we've spent several nights together. Now he's exploded and abusive on me here. I had got a written offer for my dream job too but they only gave me 3 hours to decide after a verbal acceptance. They changed some of the terms from the verbal. I asked them for more time to decide being on the cruise and the terms being changed from my verbal understanding. The person had to go ask the hiring manager. While that was going on I decided the terms were okay and I signed the offer. They came back and rescinded the offer even though I signed and agreed to all the terms. I guess the hiring manager didn't like me asking at all. Anyways I'm in a huge miserable mess. This is supposed to be a vacation but instead I got abused by both my dream job and dream guy. I don't know what to do. I just feel like going for a permanent midnight swim.

"My boyfriend has been addicted to hydrocodone oxys for about 4 years now. I'd say he averaged about the equalivant of 6-8 10mg hydros a day. Sometimes it had been worse. Sometimes better. He was supposed to get clean before this trip to New York but unfortunately that didn't happen. We're leaving this Saturday ; he 'supposedly' hasn't had a pill since Monday (which he claims was 1 10mg oxycodone). I have no idea if this is true but I can definitely tell he's cut down significantly if not (1-3 hydros MAYBE). My question to you guys is, based off maybe someone's personal experience with this kind of situation, would he be okay going to New York on nothing (it's going be a 4-5 day trip) ? He's extraordinarily mentally addicted if anything. Any advice would be beyond appreciated ! Thank you.

I've been diagnosed with ADHD since I was about 7 (I'm 22 now) and I've been taking adderall for years. My 3 yr old has been getting super aggressive and violent, can't focus on tasks all the sudden like she used to be able to, and being vindictive and peeing on the floor! Shes also been pretty intent on making our dog and cat cry in pain and run away even though ive explained it causes them pain, shes told me she doesnt care.  I've never been aggressive or experienced this kind of behavior with ADHD but my therapist says it can happen and that my daughter needs a psych evaluation, I guess I'm asking for advice or if anyone has gone through something similar with themselves or their kids and how I'm even supposed to handle this??EDIT: added in other forgotten behavior issues
