"So yesterday was day 1. Had a crap day at work (apparently being high makes the monotony almost bearable). On my way home my car broke down and I was stuck at the side of the motorway for 3 hours in the rain, waiting for recovery. But still, when I finally got home last night, I fought off the urge to go pick up. I'm glad I got rid of my grinder or I would have been desperately scraping it out. I also fought off the urge to have a drink. Instead I took the dogs for a long walk and tried to eat something. Then I came to r/leaves and read through loads of posts. I love you guys...thanks to everyone here.\nIt was hard as f*ck but I definitely proved something to myself. That I can fight cravings. So, I'm stronger than I was before.

"I am on Lamotrigine, but in January I got a job where I commute an hour and a half each way 9-5 mon-fri. Well, that seems to be every psychiatrist's hours too. They won't budge from those hours in the slightest, they won't do phone calls, and I'm too new in my job to get time off for that. In the meantime, I've gotten my GP (who says they don't know anyone like I'm looking for) to keep refilling the prescription for me. But obviously this is something I'd like someone specialized to continuously work with me on, you know?\n\nHow can I look for a psychiatrist who might work with my hours a bit? I even found one guy who does do Saturdays, but he said he strictly reserved Saturdays for children and wouldn't budge. What the fuck!? I wish there was like a bat signal for doctors so I could convey what a dilemma I'm truly in (maybe I'm not sounding desperate enough?

"Hey everyone, \n\nSo I've been trying (unsuccessfully) to ditch this habit for years. I used to love smoking and I had so much fun smoking with friends, but recently it's been taking a huge toll on me. Not only am I spending ungodly amounts of money on the stuff, but since I've been trying to quit recently, I've noticed that it heavily effects the way I think and process information. It exaggerates my depression, heightens my anxiety, and does terrible terrible things to my self worth. I hate that I haven't been able to shake this... and I want to change.\n\nSo I'm trying something different. I need support. I need help. I can't do this on my own, and these stories have really inspired me. I'm hoping by telling my own story it provides so accountability for my actions now. I want to give this up, if solely for the purpose of proving my own power to myself. \n\n\nAll I can ask is that you guys are here for me through this journey like I will be for you!!\n\nThanks for reading, Good luck out there today everyone :)

I promised myself, on my eighteenth birthday that if i was still suicidal and depressed i would carry through with it if i wanted to, but not until then. The last year has been absolute chaos and i am ready to carry through with the plan. I purchased enough fentanyl to kill a large animal. i suffer from depression and have had it since 14. I am also mtf transgender and i am sick of people discriminating agaisnt me and treating me as less than human. My parents kicked me out of the house and i now live with my grandparents. I have failed all attempts at rehabilitation including a three month stay at a residential program. I am sorry, my only wish is that my birthday would come sooner rather than another 14 days away.

"I find no enjoyment in anything. My soul has been crushed by narcissistic parents and a verbally/physically abusive ex boyfriend of 3 years. No one cares about my existence yet they wouldn't dare let me opt out. I'm not funny, cute, sexy, talented, smart, or passionate about anything. I used to be. Now all I am is tangled up headphones. A pain in the ass and more trouble than they're worth. No one wants to hear me speak. No one cares about my pain. I feel contagious, awkward. Like an opposing magnetic force that pushes everyone way inevitably. This is not living. The person inside me has died, and I'm just keeping this shell alive. For who though? People who don't care about me? What kind of silly joke is that. No one cares. No one cares. No one cares. I feel like I'd be better off dead.

I didn't get one until a almost year after the event itself. Now, finally, 5 months later, I've been able to see a psychiatrist who officially diagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and PTSD. I decided to get a workbook and my therapist and I are going to start the long journey of getting through my PTSD! I'm excited to finally know what's been going on in my brain for so long and to take steps in the right direction. It turns out my trauma narrative is a long one, with events starting from when I was only 4 years old to present, and it's probably going to take more than one session just to get through it all.

I started losing weight. No more stomache ache. No more constant feeling of depression.\n\nBut there's this sneaking suspicion that these positive feelings won't be there forever.

I'm scared that I might relapse as soon as this first euphoric phase is over.\n\nAm I just seeing everything through rose-colored glasses at the moment?

Because I used to smoke at ANY opportunity I got.\n\n This morning I feel really euphoric, like the exact feeling I get from drinking a lot of coffee or from taking adderall or vyvance.. not that strung out feeling but just really euphoric and happy. I'm having bursts of creativity and motivation and it feels so good getting this feeling naturally oh my god it's been so long. I know that this feeling won't last long and it will be paired with really low points, but this is the exact motivation I needed to know that this is the right path for me.

I've been drawing since I was 8 and I always knew I wanted a career in some form of animation or comic book making. The issue is for whatever reason, I feel I've gained this mentality of don't do anything that won't benefit your career. This doesn't sound bad on paper but what makes it an issue is that it's getting in the way of my daily life, I won't play certain video games if i can't put a purpose on them say sandbox games like gmod or minecraft I have a hard time playing them, but I didn't have an issue before when i was 12 and I still love these games but I can't play them for long periods of time without getting wicked stressed out.

She gave me an application to a competitive writing internship and I had to do a phone interview yesterday. \n\nI was really nervous during the interview and stuttered alot. But the guy told me that I gave a good answer that he hadn't heard before. After worrying about it all night, they let me know that out of the final 10 people, (the application had 3 rounds) I was one of the 2 people chosen to work for the organization for the summer. Super proud of myself (first time being proud of myself) and it feels good. I feel like I finally got my foot in the door to become an author which is my dream.

"So, about a year ago I made a post in this sub about having relapsed and got so much support that really made me feel better. Well, I got a different phone and forgot my username until literally today, a little over a year later. I relapsed one other time, a few months later with an ex boyfriend. However other than that, I've been clean! I've started having dreams again which is rough, but I'm doing well besides that. <e1>I'm really proud of this</e1>, because <e2>I saw a photo at a family function from when I was using and I look at myself now</e2> and see that I'm really truly alive again. Please don't give up guys, it seems impossible but you can escape. Thank you for the support you've shown me and I can't wait until I actually hit one year!

"Hello r/stopdrinking.\n\nI just joined r/stopdrinking today, I have been sober for 13 days.  \n\nMy favorite writers are drunks, Hemingway Hunter Scott Thompson, Dostoevsky etc.  I used to try to emulate these men, drinking heavily and writing in a melancholy overly-romantic tone.  <e1>Always hated my writing the next day</e1>, believing that <e2>all my favorite writers were at first displeased with their work</e2>.

"I saw an old post in this sub about what people experience when they can't satisfy compulsions. This is something that has been affecting me now more than ever, and I wanted to revive this conversation for myself and others who may be experiencing this. To go a bit further into detail, I'm talking about when, no matter how much you try, you cannot get something just right. You are unable to leave it alone. When I experience this, I completely shutting down. I try and try and try and at some point my brain is fried. I start hyperventilating and crying, and my whole body feels restless, like I am trapped inside my skin. I get overheated and feel like my clothes are suffocating me. My throat gets tight and I grind my teeth down, hard. I lose any ability to focus on anything, and typically just lay down and cry for a while before I am unable to regain my composure. Does anybody else experience this, either similarly or with different symptoms? If so, is there a way that you fight back against it or do you just wait for it to pass?

"I've been lurking here for a while and have been smoking for a handful of years now. I've tried quitting twice or three times, but hasn't lasted. I work in a restaurant, one of 2 cooks in the kitchen, and it's pretty stressful. It calms me down, relaxes me, and brings me back to focus after I have a smoke. I smoke two on my way to work and two on my way home also (hour commute one way). I go through a pack of American spirits in two days and I think it's time to stop. I just don't know what to do.

My old psychiatrist wasnt familiar with this treatment and and completely disregarded my concerns until my primary doctor told him about my levels. I have a different insurance now and I think my new Psychiatrist will want to change me to seroquel or I might suggest abilify with my risperdal. Does anyone have any experience with either?
