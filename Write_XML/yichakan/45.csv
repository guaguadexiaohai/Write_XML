"Hey /r/ADHD!\nMy daughter has ADHD and it is really impacting her ability to learn in class, remember and do her homework. She's tried several medications that haven't really worked out for her, some more disastrously than others. She's been on Concerta, Concerta XR, Strattera, Focalin, and Wellbutrin. The stimulants caused her to be underweight, the Strattera was a depression-fueled suicidal nightmare, and she had an allergic reaction (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome) with the Wellbutrin.\n\nI followed up with her psychiatrist about different options and she gave me two options: Adderall XR and Dexedrine (Vyvanse is XR). She says both are stimulants. I don't know anything about either of those drugs other than Adderall is great for law school allnighters. \n\nWhat is your experience with these medicines? What has worked for you? I'd appreciate any comments you have. Thank you!!

There are many factors involved in developing porn addiction, and we have all likely heard about the role that dopamine plays. Well, there may be a way to re-sensitize our brains to dopamine using nutrition. \n\nOne angle that I have yet to see talked about is the role of vitamin/mineral deficiency, specifically magnesium. It turns out that dopamine is a magnesium dependent neurotransmitter. Interestingly, up to 80% of us are deficient in magnesium because of poor diet and soil depletion. (http://www.jigsawhealth.com/resources/magnesium-mineral-deficiency)\n\nIs there a connection? \n\nHere's part of an article that I found: http://diabeticresourcecenter.com/View.aspx?url=Article819\n\n\n\nQuote\n\n\Dopamine has been called the \""pleasure neurotransmitter\"" and evidence shows that dopamine is a magnesium-dependent neurotransmitter.(5) It is possible that low levels of magnesium trigger low levels in dopamine in the brain
