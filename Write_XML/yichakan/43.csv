Today, I was writing an essay (that happens to be about my experience with an anxiety disorder) and I asked him to read it for clarity/syntax editing, and his immediate response was that it was just me being self pitying about my self pity. I was incredibly upset about what he said and I told him so. He apologized but I can't help believing that he wouldn't have said it if he didn't believe it to be true. I've had panic attacks on and off today because of it. Also, I deleted the essay and it is due at midnight tonight. I guess I just need some reassurance that talking through this isn't the same as wallowing in it.

Much more when I was drinking. Put that down too. Recently, out of the clear blue, I've been having cigarette cravings! 9 months later! They don't ever go away, not fully. Cigarettes are one hell of a god damn drug. It's not the nicotine, that's easy. It's the comfort ritual of lighting, inhaling, and holding onto a lit reminder of your mortality. I think it's because I've been having relationship issues, maybe. I don't know what it it is, actually. I'm not going to smoke again. I'm far enough away from it now that it doesn't seem like an actual possibility. It's also much harder when you live in the South, where everyone smokes. Particularly the town I live in. \n\nAnyway.

Also to slowly expose you to situations that may trigger those thoughts.

"Got diagnosed with ADHD combined.

I am now on 15mg in the morning, and i still feel no change but a tiny boost in energy. I still get distracted easily, wandering mind, autopilot, forgetful, careless etc. Im a bigger dude at 6 foot 1 inch and 230lbs. Maybe the dosage is too small still? My psychiatrist seems hesitant to up the dosage. Any tips? Am i approaching this process wrong? Adderall seems to be the most popular and most affective with others, so i was expecting atleast some sort of... difference, mentally. Unless adderall just doesnt fit me.\n\nTL;DR Adderall seems to have zero effect other than a slight energy boost, even when slowly increasing dosage. Mind is still a boggle.

"So, to start this off, I've been diagnosed with Bipolar type 2. For any who don't know, it's more focused on depression. It's crippling. 4 or 5 months of super productive mania, then I get so depressed and angry that I literally can't function. I become the most selfish of people, I fuck everyone over, and I make life impossible for myself. \n\nI have a psychiatrist, he's got me on Lamictal and Trazedone. Lamictal as a mood stabilizer, and Trazedone for sleep. I'm still building up to my full dosage of Lamictal, and it might have to go. I've developed a rash which is a serious side effect, and could be potentially life threatening. \n\nThis combined with my current crippling depression may cause me to lose my job. <e1>My parents are ready to kick me out on my ass</e1>, because <e2>I've been a douche</e2>.

It was most likely from withdrawal, this was before anyone told me a pint + every day to 2 beers is BAD.\n\nAnyway im not really asking for medical advice for myself, just general statistics.

"Hi guys, I am really embarrassed about it, but I went to a pub with a smoking friend and I caved. I had 2 rollies. I relapsed, but I want to continue my quit. I did reset my badge. Is it possible to still successfully quit after that? Did any of you relapse and manage to continue their quit?... I really feel horrible about this stupidity :(

"Not a better version of myself; that's entirely normal to want.\nBut to want to be someone completely different, someone with an altogether different personality and different life experiences, I think is a sure sign that I hate my life.\n\nI hate looking back at my life and wishing everything could have gone right. Friends. Hobbies. Talents. <e1>I hate wanting things that every teenager has but somehow I've gone without</e1>.<e2>I'm starting to feel helpless at this point</e2>.[I feel like I need someone to rescue me from all this.](http://youtu.be/OBwS66EBUcY)\n\nI don't know if this belongs on a different subreddit, there are a lot of them with the similar theme of venting and getting help. But I'm certainly depressed, for what it's worth.
