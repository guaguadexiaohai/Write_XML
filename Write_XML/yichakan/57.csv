I go to a lot of parties and events where everyone is either drunk or on drugs, going out at least once per week, I also play rugby and go to the gym.\n\n\n The thing I like about parties is loosing inhibition and just breaking out and bring able to do and say what I want, alcohol allows me to break down inhibitions and talk to people who I am too shy to talk and people who are too shy to talk to me to do that as well, and to appreciate people I know more openly. <e1>I can get girls at parties, but when I try sober I'm not as comfortable</e1> <e2>can't keep them interested</e2>.

"I took a gamble back in November by moving cross-country to start working in a call center. At the time, I was terrified my ADHD would make me hate it, but it's actually quite fun.\n\nHere's some survival tips for anyone who might be in a similar situation.\n\n* Keep a notebook of blank UNRULED paper with you. I take detailed notes on a computer, but I still often resort to paper for drawing quick sketches and jotting down information when I'm on the wrong screen.\n* Invest in a wireless headset. i bought a used Plantronics for $50. It's amazing being able to talk while walking halfway across the office.\n* Fill your space with projects. I have locks/picks, magnetic toys, old components, etc. Anytime I get stressed, I can take something apart or assemble something.\n* MONITORS.

I still consider her one of my good work friends so I will do my best to move past the disappointment of not being able to be more than friends. Now I just need to weather the wave(s) of the inevitable anxiety and depression that usually happens when I experience a big disappointment. \n\nThanks for reading, and good luck to everyone trying to figure out how to overcome their struggles!

Just a friendly PSA that some people will use this holiday as an excuse to drink and will try to tempt you into ending your sobriety for just one drink. It's not worth it. In most cases, they will be offering drinks out of ignorance and not a malicious attempt. If you feel as if you'll be pressured into drinking then please stay home or with someone who you know will not push drinks on you. Thank you all for reading and God bless!

"I have a friend who I'm very close with and also have feelings for (she knows I do and told me that it doesn't bother her, but I'm not sure if she feels the same way about me, but that's not what this is about) and lately she has been acting very apathetic towards me, showing little to no interest in what I have to say and always just basically ignoring me and only answering me with short almost monotonous phrases and not saying anything else unless I say something else in which case the cycle repeats itself.  Hell, she doesn't even smile when I wave at her like she used to. <e1>I know she's not just depressed</e1> because <e2>she talks to her other friends normally and very enthusiastically</e2> (yes, even the male ones). It's killing me and I don't think I've done anything to make her resent/dislike me so I don't know what is going on or what to do. I just scared to death that I'm on the verge of losing her as a friend. Any advice?\n\nNote: this has been going on for a couple of weeks now

"Quit LoL recently after 4 years of hard grinding day and night. At first I didn't even plan to quit, but I was getting less and less focused on LoL and reading about engineering things on Quora during queue time. Eventually stopped playing completely and sold my account.\n\nNow enrolled at a community college and excited to continue my schooling where I left off 6 years ago, and have been having fun exploring the city and applying for jobs. Adjusting to be more social was tough at first but now I don't struggle with depression like I did while playing, and I notice how much time is actually in the day.\n\nFeels really good to have stopped playing and my only regret is I didn't stop earlier. In the future I hope they have more services to help people quit games similar to Alcohol Anonymous or other drug programs.\n

"I will spare readers from expressions of shame, because although I'd much rather be on Day 10 than Day 0, I'm optimistic due to the experiences I had through my early successes.\n\nThe insomnia hit me hard and was definitely the most unexpected of the withdrawal symptoms.  I was approaching 4 days without any sleep, and <e1>I was facing the prospect of having to check myself into the ER</e1>, so <e2>my mind justified a relapse</e2> -- it seemed the only way I could make it into work and avoid potential hospital bills.\n\nBut then, of course, I kept using each of the following 5 days...truly a disease.\n\nSo I'm back at the starting line.  The improvements that I was uncovering on a day-to-day basis, despite it being so early in recovery, are enough of a motivation for me to want to kick permanently.  Knowing about the insomnia issue, I just need to be prepared and have coping mechanisms in place.\n\nIf anyone has any advice, that would be humbly appreciated of course.  But I mostly just wanted to vent, journal this setback, and record my renewed intention of making it to Day 30 and beyond towards infinity.

"I am a highschool senior who has been smoking for alittle less than 4 years. I use to smoke because it gave something interesting to my days, <e1>I really have no close friends</e1> so <e2>being high and doing homework, projects</e2>, or even volunteering like i always did was THE BEST. Hanging out with family and watching the same movie over and over was THE BEST.<e3>Anything I did was great and nothing ever worried me besides every day normal things</e3>, because <e4>I was high. But the older I've got I've watched my motivation die leaving me to not know what else i can do</e4>. Reading this subreddit has made me realize my habit and made me want to... just become healthy. I'm currently on 18 hours of no smoking. I'm honestly not in the \wanting to quit\"" mind set but after my boyfriend showed me this subreddit

"In addition to it being St. Patrick's day, and a Friday, it's also my birthday today.\n\nAnd you know what I'm doing, on this holiday/day of the week/anniversary that most people go out for? Sitting in a Target parking lot, thinking about how pathetic my life is since I'm now 25 and still don't have any fucking friends, considering ending it, and <e1>killing time</e1> because <e2>I don't want to go home and have my family realize how sad I am for not going out on my birthday</e2>.\n\nWorst thing is, my life hasn't changed at all in the past year, despite me hoping and telling myself it can.\n\nI think I'm doomed to continue this lonely-ass excuse for a life.

"Hey there, new to the sub today. \nI have attempted to quit smoking multiple times and each time I find the first few days ok, then struggle after the first week or 2. \nMy last attempt I made two months entirely smoke free and then quickly got back into a rut after a stressful time at work. \nWhilst I'm proud of how much i've cut down in the last year I'm still finding it hard to stomp out the habit completely and any tips would be greatly appreciated.

"I've been a smoker for a little over a decade at about a pack a day, and the last few years it's been causing me some respiratory issues. Chest colds lasting a lot longer with a couple of them turning into pneumonia.\n\nI started coming down with the flu Monday morning. Despite that fact, I went out for my Monday morning cigarette. <e1>Of course it was god awful</e1>. So <e2>I figured this would have to be a smoke free flu</e2>. \n\nDays one and two came with a fever. So cravings weren't really an issue. Day three came around, and I decided to stick with it. Day four has now come and gone. It was tough today, but I feel like getting sick again has afforded me an opportunity. I'm so ready to be done \n\nThe combination of flu aches and nicotine withdrawal has been hellish, but I feel really confident about this quit. Plus seeing all of the success stories in this sub is really encouraging.\n\nSo thanks &amp; good luck, y'all!

"I've quit cold turkey and the first 2 days were hard. However day 3, 4 and 5 was all smooth, barely had any cravings and didn't bother me at all. However its day 6 now and I woke up with cravings and still craving a cigarette now. I just have that constant obnoxious anxious chest tightness I had on the first day. Anyone else who quit cold turkey go through this? around 6 days/a week into it?

"Any time I get my prescription re-filled, the doctor will ask me if I ever have any suicidal thoughts. I of course lie and say no, but what would happen if I told the doctor that I do think about suicide, daily? I assume my medicine will be taken away (Paxil and Clonazepam), but what about my career? I actually have a career in healthcare myself and I can only assume that if I end up committed somewhere that it will ruin my career. I'm in the kind of position where I can't just take an extended period of time off of work out of nowhere. And please don't just say \well suicide will ruin your career even more\""
