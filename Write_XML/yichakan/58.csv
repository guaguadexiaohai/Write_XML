"(Writing mostly to get it off of my chest). I went to a meeting with my project advisor for school today. She framed the meeting as 'reflective' but it felt way more like 'blame'. <e1>Very frustrating</e1>, as when <e2>I was discussing WHY I made certain decisions, or thought of things a certain way, her only 'reflection' was telling me why that was wrong</e2>. <e3>The meeting escalated</e3>, <e4>I ended up getting angrily teary</e4> in the meeting (which was frustrating) and then she told me I was defensive (and probably assumed emotional problems).  I can typically handle constructive criticism, but the whole tone of the meeting was NOT constructive, it was more like, 'let's highlight the ways you fucked up and absolve anyone else of responsibility for not catching issues sooner'.  I find the whole 'you should have known better' style of communication very unhelpful, and let that be known.  But for the second time this week, even though I am beyond frustrated, I'm going to figure out a way through this and work on some other homework. AND resist the urge to email her debate her about her critiques. And drink a LOT of soda water while I do this.

"<e1>Hi so my work week starts on Tuesday</e1> and <e2>I feel really anxious about it</e2>.  It is my second week at FedEx as a package handler.  I had a sort of breakdown over it last week but friends and my parents helped talk me into a better mental place.  I don't want to be in this job to be honest but I need the money and such.  Once I get there and get into the groove of things it is not so bad. I just still don't like it.I just feel strong anxiety around times like now anticipating it.  My mind just hones in on it and instead of relaxing and distracting myself I tend to just ruminate on it and not get anything done (whether it be anything fun or productive).  Before I know it the whole day is gone and I've done nothing but ruminate on my anxious thoughts and then I have to go to bed and deal with work in the morning.So does anyone have any tips for dealing with this anxiety and just relaxing myself so I can enjoy this last day off before my work week begins anew?

Ive sat with her in lunch before and I think she's fine with me being there, <e1>I just feel kind of awkward</e1> <e2>only knowing her and usually having nothing to say when I first sit down</e2>. The only place I can find her normally is with those friends in lunch so...My question: how can I get a convo going today or tomorrow morning to ask her something along the lines of us meeting in lunch.  It's something so normal for kids to do in HS. I just don't know what to say now and feel I should get casual convo going first. Idk if there is a good way to make her want to meet up with me. In addition, I need ideas on how to start conversations on snapchat or to some extent IRL. Everyone says open ended questions but I don't want to sound like an interviewer

I always feel extremely energetic when I get this feeling, and I have generally attributed this to hyperactivity, but I feel it could be something having to do with anxiety as well. I haven't really seen anything on the internet about something like this, maybe because it's so hard to put into words.Does anyone else get this feeling? Do you think it's anxiety or ADHD related? If it helps, I'm still young, 19, does anyone older get this feeling?

"Hello- I wanted to share that I am 6 months sober today. It has been hard work, but definitely worth it. I am thinking about drinking less, although it still does pop up. I am just curious where/how other people felt 6 months in? I know everyones recovery is different but I just want to see if I am on the right track. I am definitely still self conscious, and not 100% comfortable, but I feel it is getting better. I also still have the moments where I wish I could drink, like a normal person. Did these feelings subside for you all? Also, I am feeling lonely somewhat. I am 28 and I know that this is the right decision for me, but still being single in your late 20s a lot of socializing revolves around alcohol. I guess I am worried about what a potential date might think, even though being sober is clearly better than someone who overdrinks.

"How do you deal with your ADHD without medication?I've searched for posts in the past, but a lot of these were people scared of medication or those who had access to treatment options. For people that don't have access to these options, what other methods have you used to help?Perhaps a change to your diet, increased intake of caffeine, certain habits? How effective were they?

"I always found interesting that <e1>I extremely enjoy one-on-one conversations, but can't say a word to 2 or more people</e1>. Here's my breakdown and I'd love to hear how other people feel about this:No. of people (roughly)|My rating|How I handle it:-:|:-:|:--1|Best|I can fully empathise with the person, act and talk in a way that makes us both feel comfortable.2-5|Worst|<e2>Every one of them has a unique personality and I, unable to conform to all of them at once, shut down completely and can't say a word</e2>.6-10|Mostly bad|<e3>Nobody ever listens to everyone else</e3>, so <e4>I'm occasionally able to isolate someone and talk to them one-on-one</e4>.10-30|Neutral|Either you can easily get lost in the crowd, or if you're talking to all of them and they're interested in what you're saying, it's is cool with me. 30-Infinity|Fine|Pretty sure I won't ever try to socially interact with this amount of people at once.

"And it's not as enjoyable as used to be. You are getting bored of gaming. This is where am I right now. <e1>I decided to StopGaming at the beginning of last summer</e1>. I had my ups downs because <e2>I noticed I force myself to play instead actually enjoying it</e2>. I will be 2 months free now. I do quick peek on Steam however to check my offline time and that's all about my gaming activity.I don't have an urge to play. I'm too busy I guess. I believe even now if I had some spare time I would spend it on more productive/healthy activities.Life is too short to waste it on games. Guys

"I avoid parties at almost all costs. I avoid a lot certain social activities such as dates. I actively use online dating but chicken out last minute when it comes to meeting. Also if certain old friends want to hang out with I can't. It's not that I don't want to go its just like I cant physically force myself to do it. It's not like I make a choice not to and have reasons to back those up. Sometimes I cant make myself go and not justify why

"Just a friendly PSA to NOT DO IT. Not even a peek. You're not missing much. I was so close to blowing my hard earned streak. I ended up masturbating to my girlfriend instead. So another friendly reminder: if you're gonna jack off, fine. JUST DONT DO IT TO PORN.
