"Hello everyone,Earlier this week I found out I've gone through 17 years of hell to learn I have ADHD. It's been a life changing experience even with a few days. As a newly diagnosed teenager, I obviously have a lot of questions. Before I get started, I want to let everyone know that I have parents who ABSOLUTELY do not believe ADHD is a real thing. That I faked my way through sessions with a therapist and a psychiatrist to get medicated...My psychiatrist prescribed me to Vyvanse. A drug who was helpful on the first two days (I am on my fourth day). But, I now feel no focus or concentration on anything I attempt to do. I understand that the euphoric feeling does not indicate a proper ability to focus, but even then, I can NOT focus even after 3.5 hours if taking it. And around 5 hours, I feel the absolute worst headaches I have ever experienced. This is commonly known as a \comedown\"".I have been prone to migraines and daily headaches since I turned 13.

"That's how many miles I've ran according to my runkeeper, high. Before K it was Tramadol.  922 miles.  Incredible.   My last dose was Thursday at 7.  I've ran 6 miles since.  6 sober miles.  It wasn't horrible but it wasn't fast either.  (I did manage negative splits.) I am elated to continue running sober for the first time in years.  Running has been a part of my life since I was 16.  Funny how much K kept me from acceling my passion and I didn't even realize it.  It kept me from A LOT of things.   My goal is to run another half in the spring and a full in the fall.

Are these two things often comorbid with one another or am I reading too much into this? I read around 20% of people diagnosed with ADHD go on to develop aspd later in life, but I'm not sure if this is bullshit.

The world (normally my wife) sees 2 when it's actually 6 - or more.Then sometimes Sunday night happens and the wife puts 2 and 2 together and calls me out. Then the threats begin and the (worse) defense of my actions begins (which is always insane, drunken blabbering about why my actions aren't my fault).Today's day 2, but I'm no longer afraid of being defined as an alcoholic. My wife is desperate for me to TELL EVERYONE but I'd prefer to simply switch to \I don't drink\"" (to folks I haven't binged with before) and to \""I don't drink anymore\"" (to the rest).I have told all family. I'm an alcoholic. Drinking's not for me.I will not drink with any of you handsome bastards and pretty bastardettes today.""

It really does give me strength during those urges to drink. I can humbly say to all of you that are just starting (or re-starting) your sobriety journey that it does get easier over time. The first 2 weeks were especially tough. I probably thought about drinking about 100 times a day. Now it's down to about 10.

"I'm a junior in high school and have trouble doing my homework. I always have, but it's a lot worse this year and I don't know why. I think it's more of a problem getting started on homework then staying on task, although now that I think about it even if I do start something I'm distracted in 10 minutes. So it's probably both. I get home from school and dick around online until I go to bed instead of getting anything done. So my grades are really doing badly, and I need good grades this year so I can go to college. (I want to do something related to zoology, so I can't just skip college, either.) I take Concerta at some dose I forgot, but it really destroys my personality so I can't up the dose. Do any of you have any advice for how I can motivate myself to stay on task and do homework besides medication and the boring generic shit online like \stop procrastinating\"" and \""get a planner\"". None of the stuff I find on listicles helps me. TL;DR: High school student with ADHD has no motivation to do homework

"I've been taking concerta (54mg) for my ADHD for just over a month now, and have noticed that often about an hour after I take it I have a period of slightly increased anxiety (I usually only notice this happen if I'm not busy, and I don't have an anxiety disorder). It lasts for about an hour before fading, and by far the worst part of it is noise sensitivity- things seem uncomfortably loud, and normal/moderate level to loud sounds (particularly people talking) will produce a 'nails-on-chalkboard' type emotional response. It's not something I can recall happening in the past, except for maybe on one or two occasions when I was feeling very stressed/nervous. Now, though, I'm not sure whether it's the anxiety causing the noise sensitivity or the noise sensitivity causing the anxiety.Has anyone here had this type of response to medication? Is it a side effect that often occurs? Could it be unrelated to the meds? (I'm not looking for medical advice, just curious to see what people know about this phenomenon.

There's no need to commit to stopping whatever you were doing, you can go back to it afterwards - I find this makes it easier to put it down and get up, and even if you go back to it it tends to be a bit less autopiloty and you can try again later anyway.

Why the fuck is this shit so common? It literally makes zero sense from an evolutionary point of view. Wanting to kill yourself, zero sex drive, little appetite. There are very few reasons for me to be depressed with my current life. It's some fucking illness that I can't even put into words for the doctors I've seen. Fuck Me

"ADHD patients have been found to have. The difference is 5-fold and consistent.Trace amines are neurotransmitters (chemicals used for nerve cell communication) that release monoamines - dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. A low level of these chemicals would cause someone to have lower monoamine levels, a possible cause of ADHD. Amphetamine is a good treatment for ADHD since it is very similar phenethylamine, a trace amine - both do the exact same thng in the brain, Amphetamine just acts longer.Therefore, can ADHD be diagnosed with urine tests?

So, basically, does anyone have advice about what I should do about any of this? I started taking Tums before dosing, but, honestly, I didn't notice any difference at all.

"I've attempted suicide twice this year and I've been into the hospital more times than I want to admit to, and no matter how much support is offered, nothing ever helps.I constantly feel like I deserve the things I feel, and that suicide is the only way for me to escape. Every time I think there's another way out, within days I'm back into suicidal ideation. Nothing ever improves and I'm just biding my time.

"College feels like prison,  <e1>i only attended college</e1> > because < of <e2>my parents asked me to even though</e2> i'm not really interested in the said subject, i only attend it for the degree so my parents and society will accept me.  <e3>Kinda laughed to myself when my mom asked why i have no will for it, even though i like drawing (i'm animation major)</e3> because <e4>lately i've been losing my will to do anything</e4>, even living. College is just a big guild trip from my parents to protect their reputation. As i always say to myself, i'm not suicidal but i really don't mind dying to be honest. I always imagine getting hit by some accident and can leave the world peacefully instead of attempting 'selfish action' that would damage my family reputation. The only thing that makes me alive is all the guild that accumulated inside me from my parents, i haven't repaid them yet, and how i imagine the sadness from my mom if i died, probably my dad won't care as much.  Nobody would care if i dissapeared from their lives except my mom anyways.

"I was diagnosed with depression about 7 years ago now, and I've never been open with my family about it. My mum doesn't know and I've lied about how I got my scars.  <e1>I refuse to go back on antidepressants currently, even though I probably should</e1>,because <e2>I feel like I'd be failing</e2> . Since then several of my family members, including my mum, have been put on anti depressants. Thy all sit around and openly chat about it and almost seem to enjoy the attention that they can get from the sympathy they get, and love sitting there and whinging and moaning. I've never been like that and the more it happens the more I feel more and more withdrawn and like I want to keep all my problems to myself as I don't want to sound like them, but I know it's probably making me more and more introverted. Does anyone else have any experience with anything like this?

"Pretending to be asleep so I don't have to socialize with my family. Its so hard to fake a smile this many days in a row. I just want to go home to my solitude. But when I am home, I live alone, I feel lonely and want to be around people. I just can't be happy. I'm miserable alone and I'm miserable around family. I'm just so tired and lonely. Haven't been able to cry in months, even when I really wanted to. I don't know how to fix me. Is this life worth living? I don't know how much longer I can keep living for someone else when I want to give myself the gift of peace
