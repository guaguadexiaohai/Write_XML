"""hello reddit. i'm a 54 m who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease. according to doctors i have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body. that, however is not what i want to talk about.i've had a hard life. i spent most of my childhood all alone, with no friends, always desperate for tiniest bit of affection. my parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me. while i'm deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me, back in that time i didn't understand any of that. all i could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents didn't. i did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention. so many stupid and embarrassing things that i don't remember anymore since i really don't want to. overall i hated my childhood.i've never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because i was comfortable with it. however since a long time before i stepped into my teen years, i knew i was maybe a little bit different. i hated sports, instead i really loved reading books, there were some other examples but like i said, i don't remember much about my childhood. i also didn't think they were a big deal. when i became a teenager i discovered that unlike any other teenage boys i knew, i was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason. i thought that i'll probably get there in time. i didn't. now, i was different, in a very conservative and judging society. a society which even divorced people get looked at with anger. when i realized that instead of getting attracted to girls, i like boys, i panicked! i was only 14, i knew very little, i thought i'll get out of this mess as i grow older. in that period of time, i thought i was the only one like that. i was different. for the rest of my teenage life i ignored that, hoping for a change in my preference in the future.when i grew older i became aware of what situation i was in. i was, ... <e1>gay</e1>. even to this day i can't say that word without my voice shaking. i tried everything to change, it did not work. many many questions were raised in my head. like """"why am i like this?"""", """"how am i going to live like this?"""" i encountered a huge moral, religious, and cultural dilemma. it was horrible. untill this day i've got no answers. it was simply so much for me to process.  this quickly affected me and became a major source of <e2>depression</e2>, <e3>anxiety</e3>, <e4>social insecurities</e4> and etc. i <e5>gained a lot of weight</e5> as a result and <e6>went through a very depressing path</e6>. due to all the stress and <e7>anxiety</e7> i encountered <e8>achromotrichia</e8> and <e9>my hairs started becoming white</e9> at early ages. then i went through a severe phase when i was 18 in which i tried confronting myself. i tried my best to accept who i am. i didn't want to change, just wanted to come clean and admit it. it was not successful. i fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety, from 2 of my friends whom i came out to, one refused to believe what i am and one cut ties with me. my best friend, even though he could not believe it, was actually supportive, but soon he moved far away in a different state. i had no one to talk to. my family didn't know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse. i couldn't stand how sad my parents would get if i told them what i was. after all they did for me i couldn't bring tears to my mom's eyes and sadness to my dad. i spent about a month just waking up, eating, and staring at my room with no purpose. i finally had it decided. after 32 days i started planning my suicide.everything was set on that day. i already did everything and i went to bed early that night so that i'd be ready for the big day. as i was tying the rope around my neck, i heard my little sister's laughter. i burst into tears. once again i was being selfish. how could i make her little heart sad? how cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that? i stopped. i knew this would happen again if i don't make any changes. so i did. i promised my self never to think of that issue again. i suppressed my sexual desires. i kept myself busy with other stuff so that i wouldn't get distracted. i was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what i was. i could live my pathetic life again.when i was aware of my condition, i made myself a promise. that i wouldn't emotionally hurt anyone and that i don't do anything about my sex life. fun fact, i'm still a virgin til this day. despite my family's pressure, i didn't get married. how could i force myself to like a women and ruin her life. why would i start a family which i can't love the way i should. why would i ruin someone else's life because of my selfishness. i didn't date or confess to anyone either. as far as i knew, i couldn't live with the emotional weight of  accepting who i am. how could i enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person? the night that i made myself that promise i very well knew this means i will die all alone. with no one to hold me, hug me, or kiss me. funny how i still crave human contact though i didn't have any even when i was a kid.rest of my life was boring. i lived. i had a good job with good payment. that's it. i never felt happy. i had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings. i never told anyone what i was again. i lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door. and now i have cancer. with a much more limited time than ever. i'm actually kinda <e10>happy</e10>, <e11>it'll all end soon</e11>. i only wish i could be happier, without all these regrets. i would've wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but i can't imagine how would that go. i'd also wish for me to be straight but i honestly have no idea how that works. not once i was interested in women to have a sense of that. i even tried looking at pictures of  """"hot women"""" ( it's hilarious i know. ) for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it didn't.so, at the end, i'm soon dying, never kissed the person i loved, or even met the person i loved, full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness. i don't exactly know who will read this, i never got noticed in my life i don't see why i should be noticed now. i also don't know how much time i have left. so i say to the world, farewell, i didn't hate you but i hated myself the most.""

and <e3>hearing my mother scream for my brother</e3> because <e4>my father was choking her in their bedroom</e4>. was a big steroid fan back in the day. i <e5>spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one</e5> because i frequently <e6>got cs in school</e6> which my <e7>parents would ground us</e7> for. even one c on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. i still remember <e8>getting in trouble so badly</e8> for <e9>lying about doing my homework</e9>, not even so much for not doing my homework. but it was distinctly about lying about it. my father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and i remember my mother saying well dont choke him (insert name) and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying im not choking him i still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified i was that the gameboy sp i was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because i was certain i was going to get beat again. i remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that i was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. i remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them.but you know. now that im an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. if im going to get my ass beat im going to get my ass beat. im just not living in fear anymore. }}}}{my thoughts on my brother}{{{{which brings me to my brother. who as of lately might as well be dead to me. we have not currently spoken since april, and as far as im concerned we probably wont ever speak again. lets start with me saying i feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. me bailing him out when he needs it. i remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to wake him up after rugrats when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. the police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until youre 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was highly frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. my dumb ass. bailing him out again. until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didnt air it out. so when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. my brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. my brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. i dont remember which. being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged i think with robbery. then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. and of course theres my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to miami.""

school. this is where so many problems came to rise. words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. this is when school pressure really started hitting me and that i felt the need

day. my friend saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb i looked with chalk on my clothes. students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. i was so suicidal that day. next is 8th grade. not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. i was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. the teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. when i came in that class on the first day, i almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and i knew none of them. some of the other students i sat with hated me because i got some of the concepts confusing. insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. high school is better then middle school, but i still hate school in general. 9th grade: ive never been so lonely. 10th grade: my existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. i dont want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. i wish i can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. if i cant even do it well in high school, then how can i do it college ?life is so horrible. i get abused for the most minor things and i dont know what to do anymore. i have no idea what to do for the future because i ruined my grades and ive overthought what i want to be when i grow up. i attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. i dont understand why people just wont help me, even when i reach out. i wish my life just ended by whatever means. i <e15>dont to be homeless</e15> especially at this because its insanely <e16>cold outside</16>. my point is everything is just not fucking fair. i actively try do the most i can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody

"""sorry, <e1>this is my first reddit post</e1>, <e2>i'm fairly new to the community</e2>. thank you for taking the time to read this.like (presumably) a lot of people, i felt as if <e3>i was incredibly smart growing up</e3>. <e4>i was able to start school early when i was younger</e4>, <e5>i had a near perfect gpa</e5>, <e6>i painted</e6>, <e7>i played multiple instruments</e7>, and <e8>my parents were pushing me to apply for top schools</e8>. my future looked really bright.however, in the middle of senior year (of high school), something felt really wrong, and everything began to fall apart (lol, that sounds overly dramatic...but just know that i really was not in the right state of mind). <e9>i couldn't get up to eat</e9>, <e10>i cried at random times at school</e10>, (warning for triggering visualization? not sure if this would count as one) ** <e11>i began to harm myself a lot</e11> (like i mostly beat my legs or arms with objects), and <e12>i was just deep into depression</e12>. i tried to commit suicide multiple times, **like i've experienced periods of sadness before this, but never as intense and for an entire year.luckily, <e13>i did well enough in school</e13> before all of this happened, so <e14>i was awarded a scholarship</e14> to let me <e15>go to community college for free</e15> so <e16>i didn't completely self-sabotage my future</e16>. so <e17>i've been working on transferring for the past year</e17>.however, <e18>i'm so distraught</e18>. <e19>i feel like my intelligence has gone down the drain</e19>. i slur when i talk, i developed a bit of a lisp, i can't coordinate my actions to my thoughts, i even forget letters when writing (for example, i would write """"oadside"""" instead of """"roadside"""" or """"mozzera"""" instead of """"mozzerella""""). <e20>i feel so, so disappointed in myself</e20> and <e21>it's ruining my self esteem</e21> . i even had to say the phrase """"i want to know what i originally got on my essay"""" three times the other day to my professor because i couldn't remember how to say it, and he looked at me really funny.""

"no one wants to be brought down when they are doing fine. and thats all i do to people - bring them down. i dont know who to turn to. i need to talk about my problems and my emotions but my friends and my partner seem to be doing much better than i am and im not even able to talk to them without being so negative and depressed and inevitable making them feel down. and now i can see that it must suck to talk to me or be around me. i hate who i have become. i wish <e1>i could be more positive and happy</e1> so that i can <e2>make the people around me feel good</e2> instead of making them feel like shit but i cant. im so stressed and depressed about the world.  i started seeing a therapist but even then i feel like its just his job to listen to me and he wouldnt do if it wasnt his job. ive realized <e3>no one really wants to deal with me</e3>. this makes me <e4>want to disappear</e4>.
