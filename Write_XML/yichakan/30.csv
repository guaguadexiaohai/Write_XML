That and learning how to differentiate between something that should make me feel guilty, and something that is just a normal part of who I am.Does this make sense to anyone else?

Feeling empty is surprisingly common, and especially common for people who struggle with BPD, but therapists, researchers and academics haven't ever paid much attention to why people who feel this way, or what can be done about it. My research team and I want to change this.We want to hear from people who have ever felt empty in a short, 15 minute, anonymous survey about their experiences. So far 750 people have taken part! But we want to reach 1000!

Im even socializing with strangers. What can we learn from this??To be like other (normal) people we need to live without inhibitions, at least most of them. WE have to stop second guessing ourselves all the time, being afraid of making eye contact with some people, trying to meet new friends, overreacting to comments, etc. This is the only way to be chill and make new friends and keep them. The question is how do you do it w.out bein drunk or on meds?

My best friend has just met someone on tinder (she appears to have met the only decent guy in our age range) and has been hanging out with him. All of my other friends are in serious long term relationships. I AM happy for them but it¡¯s hard. I haven¡¯t had a hug since March. I miss the fun, affection and intimacy of being with someone. My BF is coming over tomorrow and I don¡¯t know how to deal with her giving me the deets. If I was in a better place I¡¯d be all over this chat. But right now I¡¯m so meh.

"First let me say that I don't intend to be provocative. I want to have a civil discussion.I think therapy can help, it's true that you can only change your behavior through therapy and there's no other accepted treatment for BPD.I don't think any form of therapy is perfect and I don't think it can solve everything. I think the answer to a lot of issues that people with BPD face is more therapy and sometimes that's simply not good enough. I think a lot of peoples issues get dismissed and left untreated this way.I think too often posts that criticize therapy get downvoted. <e1>When I talk negatively about therapy whether it's online or in real life people immediately jump to the conclusion that it was my fault</e1> because <e2>I wasn't trying hard enough</e2>. It seems to me that people don't want to acknowledge that it isn't the perfect solution.I think that this is problematic and I think we should talk about it more openly. Treatments can only improve through criticism. I think that we need a open environment to express our concerns or they won't be heard. This is true for every mental illness.

Seeing the ""bigger picture"". It's hard but I'm trying to practice that way of looking at things.  Trying to look at things from a top level.

No 1. And cycle 2. I then check my thoughts and look deeper at other possibilties that are not just ALL bad.By being conscience of Cycle 1 and swapping it with Cycle 2, You are now using your rational mind.

I always assumed it was just depression and anxiety, but there were several things that lasted decades: suicidal ideation, eating disorder, substance abuse.  I always thought they could be handled, then came the absolutely brutal discard, splitting phase. One day she casually looked up from her phone and told me she didn't want to be married anymore.  Over the next year her behavior became increasingly odd, spaced out at times, she treated me as though I didn't exist, pretty sure there was other men. She started seeing a psychatrist who treated her for bipolar disorder with every prescription under the sun, her behavior became increasingly bizarre.  I started using words like ""discard"", ""walking on eggshells"" ""Gaslighting"", without any idea about BPD.

I feel like the biggest piece of shit right now.I suspect my mother has BPD. In the desperate attempt to not be like her, I've picked up a lot of her behaviors, but was never formally diagnosed myself.This person asked me why I treated them the way I did. And when I tried to talk about my mother and my learned behaviors, it felt so inauthentic that I was disgusted by myself. Everything sounded like I was blaming my mother and playing the victim. It sent me into a full blown panic attack.I feel so damn low right now. I've been in therapy so long to not be like my mother that when confronted with the fact that I've picked up some of her habits, I feel like all the progress I've made is bullshit.I was so convinced I was better than my mother. I'm just like her. It's devastating and I don't know how to handle it.

But isn't this basically narcissism / sociopathy? Feeling like you're the better one and entitled to hurt someone else because they are ""the baddies""?I don't know if that makes any sense.

It doesn't. Anyway, after the diagnose he apologised and said that he will support me and etc. He handles my mental disorder in a weird way. He doesn't really understand the concept of all of this. So I wanted to ask, if maybe any of you could recommend some books I could give him and my mom so they could grasp some of the concept? sorry I unloaded a bit more, than was maybe neccessary, I just feel a little bit at a loss here.

"Until my diagnosis, I was convinced I was a completely useless, lazy, stupid human being who couldn't handle basic emotions like anger or sadness or happiness without becoming completely overwhelmed and either acting out or shutting down entirely. I thought that I must have just skipped the part of growing up where suddenly people around me where able to handle these emotions and daily life without becoming handicapped at every little bump in the road. It has been such a relief to get my diagnosis and realize that the reason for this was my disorder, not that I'm a lesser person.

I still feel so bad about it.But then this older dude (mid 50s) came by and stood besides me. He asked me what I was doing. I didnt tell him at first but he kept pressing and asking what I was doing. So I told him. I just sat there and cried my eyes out and I told him everything. And he just stood there and listened. And when I'd finished he asked me to get down from the overlook and stand next to him. Then he gave me a hug. A warm hug.And he just talks to me and we walk to the bus station. And he tells me everything is gonna be ok. He tells me to keep trying and to not give up. He tells me he cares. And I just cry whilst speaking to him.I'm home now but i dont know who this person is or why they helped me but thank you to them.

"Whether it be by impulsive actions, eating disorders, or suicide us folks with BPD are so susceptible to dying young. We've all felt close to the edge and some days when you're really close to that edge and nothing feels right, the fact that you are still breathing is such a fucking accomplishment. My goal today is to keep living as a fuck you to that voice in my head that tells me not to bother.

"I meant to stop using Tinder, but I found her on there, so I wanted to see her again, if only in a picture. I'm not a smart man, so I saw her again there and swiped her right, just to see. And we matched. That was yesterday, some 20 hours ago, and I'm anxious and confused as fuck. I threw her a message there, just a gif (which I uploaded here), but she hasn't replied.The story thus far: we met, I fell in love she didn't, I confessed my feelings, we hanged out for a year, until she informed me she would be moving to the other side of the world, I felt betrayed, we stopped talking, she unfriended me on Facebook etc. and we haven't talked or hung out or anything for a year or so now; and now we matched on Tinder.I don't know what to do.Edit: Well, not true.
