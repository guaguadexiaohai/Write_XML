In my case, my depression has been resistant to all the anti-depressants I have tried, and while I haven't had an episode that would meet the full criteria of mania or even hypomania, I am curious about the possibility that it may be bipolar.

"Hey everyone, fairly long time lurker with a serious concern. Last summer I found out I was ADHD-PI. I got on vyvanse, and my semester of school following the summer everything was fine. I did decent on my work, could have done better, but it was not too bad. Then this semester everything sort of crashed. I was late to class all the time (out of my normal habits), I wasn't getting assignments done at all (as opposed to just starting them late, but still getting them done), and I was depressed about basically everything. \n\nI became stuck in a cycle, <e1>I would procrastinate, and either do really poorly on an assignment or not do it at all</e1>, then <e2>get incredibly depressed about it all</e2>. I feel helpless about the whole thing. I have finals this week, and Im still in the cycle, I havent studied at all for it. All my friends I can assume are getting tired of me being sad all the time, or asking them for help with something only to see small or no results. My best friend/roommate basically told me he was \pissed off at me for not helping myself\""

I'm going to discuss with him some bad attention habits as well as some very bad social anxiety I have had mostly all of my life but has now become crippling as I've gotten older.\n\nI was curious what type of therapy others were recommended by their doctors to help with their problems, before or after medication, and if they were prescribed medications, were they expected to stay on them for the entirety of their life (if they felt they needed it)? Or did your doctor only prescribe them for a strict period of time?\n\nI'm worried any medicational treatment won't be able to treat both of the problems I've been having simultaneously.\n\nVery thankful for the help.

"I'm on day 46 and most of the time it has been pretty easy not to smoke.\n\nThe thing is, that i have such good memories of smoking. When i think about cigarettes i don't think that it's disgusting to smoke, like nonsmokers obviously do.\n\nThis may seem weird, but I dreamt of smoking a cig about once a week since i stopped. The first weeks I felt guilty in my dream and threw it away, last week I finished it^^.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Could this be the first dangerous phase to start again? Is this even a phase? Did you have similar experiences 1 and a half month in? Will the positive feeling about cigarettes ever go away?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.
