I am just curious what others do :)   My food taste has totally changed since starting medication. All I can get down is a small piece of meat and veggies. I used to like pasta, noodles, soups, casseroles etc. but now all I like is meat and veg.   My day goes like this..  7.30am - 10mg Dex and a apple  11.30am- 2.5mg Dex  1pm-2pmish Snack of some sort- 4 crackers or half a avacodo etc. and 2.5mg of Dex    6pm- Small piece of meat (steak, chicken etc.) and maybe a small serve of veg or some more fruit.

It's technically below the minimum for acceptance, but I saw on the school's website that exceptions can be made if other parts of the application are strong. The main reason my GPA was so low was because I was struggling with really terrible depression. My medical records and the Dean of Students from my undergrad could back me up.  So my question is, is it worth emailing the grad school admissions office to explain that? Would they believe me? Would they take it seriously, or think depression isn't a legitimate illness?

"How do you tell the difference between paranoia and a very bad case of anxiety? My understanding is that while anxiety can cause you to have irrational thoughts (everyone hates me, people probably gossip about me, etc.), paranoia involves greater feelings of persecution. That someone or something (or the world) is out to get you, that your reputation is in danger, that your life is a series of calculated moves to avoid being caught, exposed, or foiled, and that you're just waiting for something to slip up. There's a greater element of secrecy and mistrust involved. The way I understand it though, with paranoia you also think you're completely and totally normal; you have no suspicion that your behavior *isn't* normal, and those thoughts of self-awareness never even cross your mind.   So how do you distinguish between the two?

The side effects make me ultimately depressed and want to cry and sleep. I took 15mg Anti-depressant Lexapro Escitalopram before for like 4 months. So now I am really confused what to do, I dont know whether I should go or not. I definitely dont want Ritalin anymore, that depressed feeling is so scary.

My chest will suddenly clench up, as I'm falling asleep, not thinking about anything, while dreaming, and having no anxiety what-so-ever (at-least to my knowledge, could it be subconscious?). I'll wake up gasping or screaming. It's terrifying. The pain's usually a 9/10  I called 911 the first time it happened. An ambulance came, they put monitors on, and said everything seemed normal, that it was just anxiety.   Another side effect of these attacks are hallucinations. With my lack of sleep, I've started to see faces, red eyes, or hear voices.. what in the actual ****?   They're extremely fearsome. Their demeanor is usually twisted or deformed. Nothing online is more frightening than my visualizations. I swear I could make a really awesome video game if I could get these down on paper, heh.  The voices are deep and gravely.

"New lady at my crappy psychiatry office gave me a free sample of Saphris to help with anxiety, along with my normal small dose of fluoxetine.  She did so casually and with little knowledge of my actual problem.  Moreover, she gave me almost no information about what the drug is actually for, how it is to be used, what its downsides are, what it costs, or whether my insurance covers it.  I'm always glad to take free samples of things.  But I don't feel like I need an extra drug, and the little I've read about Saphris since that visit suggests that I'd better leave it alone.  Also, if I weren't a competent, responsible person who likes to be in charge of his own medical treatment, I would probably be wise to find a better psychiatrist.

"Hello. I am ADHD diagnosed and perscribed 15 mg Adderall XR. I have been taking it about two times per week for the past 8 months or so.   It has helped me focus, which has been a blessing academically. Secondarily, it seems to reliably alleviate my brain fog. I define brain fog as feeling generally understimulated, fried out (numb), and some anhedonia. This may very well be depression I am describing, but I cannot really convey how I feel in a way that will resonate with doctors, let alone a public forum. I don't really feel excessive anxiety or sadness, so it's tough.   Adderall doesn't give me euphoria, but it makes me feel more immersed in daily life. Oh, and it completely lifts my IBS. I like that, but I am scared the effects will fade of I take it more often. On the other hand, it would be great to feel better grounded 5 days per week.   Is the brain fog alleviation something I can expect to fade or will it stay? If it is likely to fade, I will consider asking my doctor for an SSRI or Wellbutrin.   Thank you.

"I've been depressed for the most part of my life, and only realized that I was actually depressed about one year ago. I thought this was normal, I thought this is what everyone felt like. After contemplating death and suicide every day, I finally took the decision to see a psychiatrist who put me on medication, and I started seeing my university's councilor. This was about 3-4 months ago, and I've gotten noticeably better. My psychiatrist wants to start lowering the dosages of my antidepressant starting next January.  But I don't want my depression to leave me. I've gotten so used to it I don't want it to be gone. Am I selfish for thinking that? The past week has been hard for me, I'm getting back into old habits that I've tried so hard to get rid of. Overeating on unhealthy food, skipping classes, and playing video games most of the day.

I'd like to dissolve 3 capsules (210mg total) in 400ml of water for 4 doses of 52.5mg, but I'm not sure if the solution will still be effective after 4 days. I've tried searching and googling, but answers seem inconclusive, and unfortunately I didn't think to ask my doctor on my last visit.  TL;DR: Will Vyvanse solution last 4 days in the fridge without any drop in efficacy?

"I just wanted to get a consensus on how medications affect your sociability, typically for people like myself who tend to feel nervous and awkward in most social settings. The social anxiety, for me, stems from the fact that I can not remember details from my life that others usually can. For example a conversation may veer towards a movie we just watched a couple days ago. In that scenario my mind will draw a blank and I will not be able to remember enough details to be able to have a coherent conversation. Movies, and books for that matter, are something that are enjoyed in the moment, so as a result, my recall of them is horrendous. I can tell you my favorite books but can in no way give you intricate plot details like most can, as soon as I am done reading its erased from my mind. So I guess my question for this post is:  Does medication help you recall information to form better conversations? If so, has this led to you forming better/healthier relationships?

"Hey everyone.  I recently went to my GP who diagnosed a few of my family members with ADHD and explained I feel like I have ADHD-PI. He started me on 5-10mg IR as needed. I started out with 5mg until it only lasted 2 hours, then I moved to 10mg. Now the 10mg only lasts 2 hours maybe and it doesn't seem to be working as well either. At this point I've been taking it 4-5 times a week 2x a day.  I guess I have two questions. I am scared this is going to keep happening (having to increase my dose) and I'm also scared I don't have ADD. According to the doctor, if I take it and feel calm then I have ADD. However I've found some random things on the internet that says this is a myth. So now I'm confused.  On Adderall, my SO said I am more \stable\"".

"I've had depression on and off my whole life. I've also always liked writing. People always say that writing is an excellent tool for coping, but often when I'm at a low point and I try to write I end up feeling worse. Like sometimes pulling those things out of my head just makes them more real. I guess I'm just wondering about the experience others have had with depression and writing, be it a diary or fiction or whatever. Does it make you feel better, or worse?

"Just got done seeing my therapist, I'm not making any progress with her. She wants me to exercise - I can't. She wants me to look for a job - I can't. She wants me to go out and volunteer - I can't. This world is too fast paced for some useless schmuck like me. Going into stores makes me anxious, driving makes me anxious, crowds make me anxious, talking to strangers makes me anxious. How the hell am I supposed to function in this world?! The prescribed meds they give me don't fucking work - I constantly have suicidal thoughts and I can't escape this negative feedback loop. I'm a useless 26-year old with no passions, no hobbies and no hope. I'm completely dependent on my parents and I don't have the necessary life skills and coping skills to make it in this world on my own. I was isolated from the world for far too long. My smile will never come back... my laughter will never return. I have nothing left to give.  TLDR - Fuck it, I'm done after the holidays.

"TLDR: Finally see some progress in a pill helping me out.   So a few months ago I found out I have ADHD and was really bugging me when I started in a college. I tried Ritalin and wasn't seeing any progress even after the dosage was raised. Started Strattera two or three weeks ago and took 60mg for the first time today. Finally saw some progress.   Gotta be honest, I didn't think I'd be able to find any pill that worked for me. I kind of screwed up my body by taking headache pills daily after brain surgery a few years ago. Eventually most pills (even some stuff prescribed for other reasons)  stopped working for me but anyways, <e1>I noticed some progress today</e1> and <e2>I'm really excited about it</e2>.

I don't understand how people are able to take on such a heavy workload every semester for four or five years. You would have to be very efficient at doing your coursework in the limited study time to make it actually successful. Most of these stories also include the fact that they consistently maintain high grades, usually 3.5 - 4.0 even.  What would a daily schedule might look like for someone that is working two (or more) jobs and taking 18 (or more) credit hours? How do they have enough time for sleep, housework, and recharging/relaxing/de-stressing activities? Does this kind of person eat only convenience/premade foods with disposable dishes? Or maybe the major they chose allows this, whereas mine (theatre tech) does not?   And mostly, I would love to hear about people with ADHD's successes in handling similar heavy workloads/responsibilities!

"Earlier post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/3wwn28/seeking_guidance_to_help_my_brother/  tl; dr - Brother came down from a week long binge hard, I got him checked into detox in the ER.  He spent three days there, came out today.  I was not there when they released him, and when I finally found him he was in a really bad state.  Stumbling, slurring his speech, forgetting things that he said ten minutes ago.  He claims that they pumped him full of Valium and/or Benzo when they discharged him.  Having a hard time with:  A) They discharged him normally in such an impaired state. B) He's showing all the signs of being drunk except for the smell.  Wondering if there is any possibility that he is telling the truth?  That these drugs can create those sorts of effects?  Or else I imagine he checked himself out against their wishes, climbed back in the bottle and then called for help when it started getting serious.  If he has been drinking, I'm rather concerned about possible side effects of alcohol withdrawal drugs and alcohol mixed.  Watching his breathing now, he's crashed.  Cheers.

"So after a long talk with my Therapist and Doctor about my issues with concentrating and my low energy levels even tho I eat right and usually get a run or so in a day they suggested a trial for Vyvanse to help me on days when I needed it such as when I have classes or go to work. What should I expect, I've never taken a stimulant before and am kinda curious. I'm about to head to work and I just took two of the 30mg pills as my doctor recommended.  Edit: This was posted about 30min after taking the pills, I noticed my heart rate rising, from what I've read on other forums this should be normal when first starting out, correct?

"Not having a proper job has really done a number on my self-esteem. I gave up on looking for a job because of an awful social anxiety disorder. I couldn't handle criticism and job interviews were a nightmare. So, I just use what little money I had to convert our house into a rental apartment. Six years passed and together with my mom, had managed to build seven apartments. The income is just enough to live on and some extra for clothes and a little luxury every other month. Is it shameful to be content with my situation? All my cousins had conventional jobs. I keep being called by one of my Aunts as worthless and it hurts. We we're the poor relations, the one with bipolar mom and an unemployed, drunkard of a stepfather.

I just finished my 1st semester in junior year and I feel like a failure (despite a very solid GPA, in an honors program, limited to no debt after i graduate). A lot of it comes down to just going on Facebook and seeing so many others at my same age seemingly have the time of their lives - traveling around the world, knowing what they want to do, having wonderful internships, and having incredible social lives to boot.
