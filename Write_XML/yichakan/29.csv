"The National Council for Severe Autism (NCSA) has once again decided to use the strategy of using neurodiversity advocates against those they advocate for without the knowledge of said advocates. In their most recent Medium post ""Dozens of Disability Leaders Decry Cancel Culture at the New York Times"", a letter launched by the NCSA, the organization and signers of the letter claim that the New York Times ought to run stories about how autistic children are ""heartbreaking, isolating, terrifying, all-consuming and extremely limiting"". One of the signatures on the letter was John Elder Robison. When asked about why JER's signature was on the letter, he said via Twitter ""I¡¯m afraid it¡¯s a misunderstanding of my own making. I wrote an article in Psychology Today that they quoted from, and I allowed them to do that without giving any thought to the piece I was quoted in"" and that ""when I allowed them to use my words, I did not anticipate this result."" Basically, the NCSA forged JER's signature in order to make it appear that he was siding with the other signers of the letter. This is completely outrageous on so many levels.

Like they're incorporating mixed person-first/identity-first language, and seem to use less functioning labels, now using more support labels.I admit that I'm bad at picking up overall ""vibes"" so for all I know they are still shitty overall and these changes are purely performative (making the organisation even more insidious), but I find it hard to not view these changes as a good thing.Is there ever a point where they could become a positive organisation? No other autism-related organisation has their amount of fame or resources, so it would be amazing if these resources could be used for good things in the community. Or should the people who are driving these changes just jump ship and start a new organisation to begin with a blank slate?(to clarify: I'm not saying that they are a good organisation at this moment. I'm just curious about if and how they could evolve from here, and what the end result might look like)

Everybody is different so don't feel discouraged if you don't have the same positive traits. There might be quite some overlap between neurotypical and autistic people. The difference is in the intensity and combination of all traits.My positive autism traits might not be compatible to everyone. Meaning I think something is great but others might not. That is fine.

"Before the pandemic, I was a moderate drinker. Once everything started to close down and I got Covid myself, I took to drinking all day to pass the time.

I use it to cope with things I don¡¯t like, even though I¡¯m really trying to cut back or quit drinking all together if I have to. Sadly, I also think drinking and going out to bars helps me socialize. Anyone else here who has a drinking problem or an addictive personality?Edit: A lot of good answers here.

It¡¯s not like the government is asking for the world here, just pull your weight to keep a lid on this pandemic. Broadly, all you have to do is... nothing! Just stay at home unless you need to do essential travel (e.g. buying groceries).I always endeavour to follow instructions right down to the last word. I always respect authority whether that be my superior at work or health authorities. In my opinion, a clear and understandable set of rules makes life so much easier my making it more certain, thereby enabling me to plan my affairs better.If everyone just did as they were told, the pandemic would probably be over by now.

"Here is a picture of the corpse of the first fly this year to wake me up by trying to mate with my inner ear.This happens a few times every year even though;my room is clean,I showered before going to bed,there is no food in my room,my window is open at an angle of only 20 degrees.It happens often enough that I am convinced it's deliberate, nobody else I talk to experiences this. Those little fuckers can tell I have sensory issues and they take full advantage by waking me up with overstimulation, ruining my mood for the rest of the day.

It's supposed to be natural yet I'm always super on guard about it and it overwhelms the ability to connect with someone one on one.Anyways, I'm just curious if you guys have any thoughts or experiences on eye contact.

"Hey everyone, I hope you¡¯re having a good day/ evening.I have recently met someone special. And he told me he¡¯d been diagnosed with aspergers twelve years ago.We are 24, we understand each other very well. And he would answer my questions had I asked, but I am afraid of sounding ignorant. As someone who isn¡¯t with aspergers, and haven¡¯t even met anyone who¡¯s been diagnosed with it. I wouldn¡¯t know what questions to ask. I think I¡¯d rather get some background before i discuss it with him.If someone has the time, I¡¯d really appreciate explanatory conversations about this.Thank you in advance.

"I have always felt imposter syndrome when it comes to stimming, particularly around trying new stims. I feel I am more fidgety than the average person, and I do feel compelled to be moving around in some fashion if I am overwhelmed or even bored and under-stimulated, usually in the form of leg shaking or doing something with my hands. However I do not feel that I stim like many others do on the spectrum (I understand that I do not have to stim like others to be autistic).In terms of my feelings around trying new stims, the most common stim I have seen is rocking. I have no memory of doing this myself before I had seen others do it, but I now find myself occasionally doing it and it is soothing. <e1>I feel like a poser</e1> because <e2>it was not something I started doing until I saw it</e2>, and I feel I am consciously choosing to do it when I do.

"I was diagnosed with Asperger¡¯s at age 5. As a kid, I spent literally hundreds of hours in various therapies. My parents were open about my diagnosis, but I wasn¡¯t. I knew from a young age that <e1>people thought something was wrong with me because of my Asperger¡¯s</e1>. So naturally, <e2>I kept it a secret</e2>. When I went to social skills groups, I was one of the only girls.Now I realize that I am an exception among women with Asperger¡¯s. I¡¯ve heard many of their stories online; most of them were diagnosed well into their 20s or 30s. It¡¯s possible that women who were diagnosed in childhood simply don¡¯t talk about it on the Internet, but I have a feeling that¡¯s not the case.People who were diagnosed in adulthood: how would your life be different if you were diagnosed as a child? Do you think having a (correct) diagnosis is beneficial?

"We've known eachother for years and I'll be frank, they've been my sole reason to live for a while. And today, an old mistake i made came up in conversation and well, i guess they hadn't thought a lot about it before but the more they sat there and rethought what i had done, the more unstable they became and before i knew it they were having a full on breakdown while on call.The next moment i was blocked and honestly, i can't blame them for doing this. While i had apologised profusely for that mistake in the past, that still doesn't change my actions and if they feel better away from me then i just wish them the best. But now I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to be doing. I know why it ended, i know it was my fault, and im already working on never doing something like that again. So why does it hurt so much? I'm happy for them as long as they're okay. So why. Why am i ready to cry?

"20m.

Is a certain characteristic or symptom that differentiates the two?Could someone help me and I¡¯m really confused right now.

"My whole life I¡¯ve always felt much more connected with my pets and sometimes other peoples pets. When I was little, until like age 10 I didn¡¯t have any friends and was a lonely only child. But my mother got me a beautiful border collie mix puppy that I named Smokey. For ten years that dog helped me get through being bullied at school, feeling like something was wrong with me because I wasn¡¯t like the other kids. But she never judged me. Then I had a cat for several years which was also nice. But this year once the pandemic shut everything down snd <e1>I was in a major depressive funk</e1>, <e2>my husband decided to surprise me with a puppy</e2>. I cannot express how much better this dog has made my life. It¡¯s made it easier to get to know neighbors snd be social. When I¡¯m with my dog I don¡¯t seem as awkward and everything just seems easier. And unlike with people, whose emotions and true feelings I can never properly read, I know this dog and he knows me. Anyone else have similar stories with pets? Especially dogs it seems.
