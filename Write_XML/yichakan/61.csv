"My ex-bf (we broke up a year ago) was abusive bot sexually and mentally. I've mostly gotten over it and I'm in a relationship again and he's very supportive about it. I've just noticed that my sex drive is very low. I still have sex with my bf but most of the time it's for him and not for myself. I still enjoy it but if he didn't initiate it I probably wouldn't either. I would be completely happy in a relationship with no sex at all.\n\nI just feel like if I have sex with him when only half of me wants to I might start to hate it a lot and if I don't it will cause problems and eventually be the end of the relationship. \n\nHe never pushes me for sex or anything like that, he has just said that he would like to have sex more often than we do now.

"From my experience once my kratom use has hit a wall and ive plummeted into severe anxiety and panic to the point where i have no choice but to quit, i find it way better to go cold turkey then to try to taper. For me the effects of any amount of kratom on me after ive come to a breaking point gives me way worse symptoms then the uncomfortableness of cold turkey withdrawal.

I've wondered if it's because most human societies historically have been somewhat polygamous, so almost all women would get a shot at reproducing, but only some men would, so it would make more sense to love your sons and neglect your daughters to increase the chances that they're one of the fewer men reproducing.makes sense to allot more of your resources towards the kids who are gonna have harder competition.\n\nMy nmom doesn't just neglect us, though.
