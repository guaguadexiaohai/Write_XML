"my wife was put on bed rest last year and spent time in the hospital before our daughter was born 12 weeks prematurely. i spent a lot of time at that hospital with my wife and then in the nicu with my daughter. i was with my daughter in the nicu one day when the baby next to us began to crash and her body gave out. the noise of the machines alerting the doctors and nurses the baby was suffering were so loud. the mother's shriek's for the staff to save her child haunt me. when i close my eyes i see the mother pleading for the doctors to save her child and i hear her screams when the machine went quiet and her baby didn't make it. i never told my wife what i witnessed that day and lied to her about why that mother and baby were moved out of the nicu. it has been a few months now and i can't get past this event. it is all i ever think about and see/hear when my mind drifts away. i find myself crying uncontrollably at times when i think about this and wish these memories would go away. i find myself depressed on a level unfamiliar to me and am afraid to discuss with my wife and therapist. i <e1>don't want to admit what i witnessed</e1> as i <e2>don't wish this experience on anyone</e2>. unsure of what to do but wanted to get this off my chest.
