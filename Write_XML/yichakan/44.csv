All summer, I've been blaming my ADHD for my inability to get a job, for my inability to pursue other projects, or keep my room clean, or go to bed on time. But it's just occurred to me that ADHD may not be the main culprit at this time.\n\nIn school, while I wasn't a steam powered machine or a working dynamo, I got things done. I got things done, then was still able to pursue separate interests that required some work. But the question I've been asking myself all summer, consciously or not, has been \what is the point?\""

"Hi reddit \n\nI'm curious to see whether anyone here has a physical disability that they believe in turn caused them to have social anxiety. When and why do you feel it developed? What have you done to help get yourself over your SA? I don't have SA myself (although <e1>I am disabled myself</e1> and <e2>have gone through depression</e2> because of it) , but a girl whom I fairly close to seems to exude many of the symptoms of it, and she also has a disability that I feel might be the root cause of the why she feels the way she does, so I'm curious to see if anyone else had a similar experience.

"Hello, everyone.\n\nI've recently just started on the process to test if I have ADHD, after being on anti-depressants for a few months. <e1>It's been very stressful for me</e1>, because <e2>one day my brain feels like it's zinging around</e2> and <e3>I spend a lot of time just pacing and thinking</e3> when I should be doing plenty of other things, then <e4>the next day I just slump down to where I feel like I'm having no thoughts at all</e4>, and fall into a depressive habit of telling myself that I'm just looking for an excuse for all my past failures.Here's my question. For those of you that have been diagnosed with ADHD, how do you feel like your brain thinks and make decisions? That is, do you always have a racing internal monologue going, or do you sometimes feel like you're just in a daze making decisions and living an unorganized life sometimes without a single word being thought out? \n\nI've been obsessively looking through the books \Driven to Distraction\"" and \""Delivered from distraction\""

"There's a buzzing in my ear, omnipresent and unrelenting. I'm not certain of its origin, but it's a nuisance that get's louder -- more violent and less meaningful -- as the others approach. At the top of each hour monotonous voices bleed through the static, coldly reciting vague scripts calculated by software programs and blessed by men in robes. Blind faith and hollow industriousness are virtues repeated to reinforce our acquiescence. Empty promises all. Broken dreams amass, yet compliance is widespread. How do they all ignore the buzzing?

From my limited understanding, medications increase the amount of dopamine available in certain parts of the brain (which is beneficial), yet the brain eventually fights back via downregulation.\n\nNow, is there a limit to the amount of downregulating the brain can do?
