Lately however, my anxiety has changed in a way that I can't listen to music or watch series or films when I'm on the move. Same with podcasts. This is due to whenever I listen to music, for example, I either know what's coming (Since I've heard the song before) or I can sense or ""figure out"" the rhythme or pattern, if the song is new to me. When this happens, I drift into my thought - where I dont want to be. In a sense, I guess I get bored.The only short term solution I've found for this is to watch streams or the likes of stream highlights , because the commentary makes it more ""alive"" or something. I cant logicly deduce what will come next, and hence I stay calm.Have anyone else experienced this or something similar? Any suggestions on how to solve the issue (apart from ""get help"" and the like)?Take care friends

"For background, Ive always had a baseline of anxiety. It comes and goes and pretty much anything short of panic attacks and disassociation is a good day in my book.I recently went on a 9 day hiking trip where I was outside in the sun working a sweat all day. I had a moment of clarity where I realized I didnt even have a trace of anxiety. No picking my skin to bleeding, no nail biting, no hitting myself, no sense of dread and bees buzzing and wanting to retch at all hours of the day. It was glorious.When we came back I started exercising after work to keep it up, around 45m to 60m playing sports or doing weight circuits. Apparently, its not enough. The buzzing bees and urge to self harm and the crushing guilt of not doing anything fueled by anxious paralysis is back in force.Looking for advice on either new active careers or ways people manage to get in anxiety-reducing activity while working a desk job. I really didnt think exercise was going to make that much of a difference but here we are.

"Before the pandemic, I was a moderate drinker. Once everything started to close down and I got Covid myself, I took to drinking all day to pass the time. More than a year later, with things gradually returning to normal (at least where I live), the habit has stuck and I consider myself an alcoholic. I use it to cope with things I dont like, even though Im really trying to cut back or quit drinking all together if I have to. Sadly, I also think drinking and going out to bars helps me socialize. Anyone else here who has a drinking problem or an addictive personality?Edit: A lot of good answers here. Unfortunately, alcoholism is something that runs in my family.

No 1. And cycle 2. I then check my thoughts and look deeper at other possibilties that are not just ALL bad.By being conscience of Cycle 1 and swapping it with Cycle 2, You are now using your rational mind.

Two months after treatment, 67 percent of participants in the MDMA group no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD, compared with 32 percent in the placebo group.MDMA produced no serious adverse side effects. Some participants temporarily experienced mild symptoms like nausea and loss of appetite.This is about as excited as I can get about a clinical trial,?said Gul Dolen, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. There is nothing like this in clinical trial results for a neuropsychiatric disease.?",noncause

There were times I'd use pornography for 12 hours straight, just viewing, opening up new tabs (what an invention, right?)---being unable to close them, and flitterring between each one back and forth back and forth. It was like an electric shock. The orgasm wasn't even the best part--and it signified the end of a fiending session.I'd watch certain videos over and over, skipping around here or there, looking for key positions and sounds and words and phrases--re-engineering everything.

Enough for people to really raise their eyebrows at our recycling - maybe up to 6 bottles of beer or three large bottles of strong cider a night, considerably more on a weekend. He's a very slightly built man. He is currently taking a week off, something he has done before (he can stop drinking if chided into it) and he is clearly going through withdrawal. Earlier I found him crashed out on his bed, glassy eyed and feverish. It passed after a few minutes.  He is aware that he drinks too much, but I'm not sure he sees it as a problem. Every year I herd him to the doctor for a liver function test and his health is apparently fine, but he's only 27 and I'm concerned for the future.  What else can I do? Does it sound as though he is an alcoholic, or just someone who enjoys drinking a little too much? Should I be trying to do more than I am to help him, and if so, what?

"Hi,  I'm 28 and over the past few years I've slowly come to the realisation that I pretty much have some form of ADHD. Reading these forums has been mind blowing, I just open every thread and read a point of view I've never seen express by anyone else before, it's scary how much I can relate to everything.  I finally (after months of putting it off) saw my GP today and went through some of my symptoms, looking to get booked in to see a psychiatrist.  She tried to get me an appointment with a local adult ADHD experct in the area but he was booked out for over 6 months.  She recommended another psychiatrist who was more general and said he has some experience with ADHD but it seemed like she wasn't really sure and he was really quite general.   What I am wondering is will a psychiatrist without much ADHD experience make a diagnosis? Is there a set of guidelines that they can use to comfortably diagnose?  She also said he is used to dealing with people in high pressure jobs (I said <e1>I was under pressure from work</e1>  because <e2>I can't focus at my tasks</e2> )

If any of you can guide me in the right direction I would be eternally grateful.

"http://i.imgur.com/YrZUYR2.jpgWhen I gave up drinking, I found focus and peace. My anxiety became manageable. Money piled up in my account. I suddenly found the energy and confidence to go chase real dreams. I drank to assuage my anxiety and, on some level, to be adventuresome, to bring fun -- and risk -- into my life. When I gave it up I found real adventure, and peace, in the mountains. Now, my sobriety is not a burden, it's a comfort. I sleep soundly. I have fewer regrets, I treat people better, and now, the future seems bright. It has been a journey, it has not been easy, but I am so glad I quit.

My stomach gets heavy and I feel empty for about a day at most, usually ranges from about a minute to a few hours, but that's it. I don't know why I still want to keep trying. I keep telling myself that I can make it up in the next exams, but I don't. I keep thinking of killing myself, doing other things, something that isn't studying, but no part of me actually wants to do it. Thinking about doing things that I find enjoyable makes me feel even worse.

But in regulating my emotions, I worry that I've forgotten how to be fun, spontaneous, and energetic.Whenever I change doses or muster the courage to take a day off meds, the next day on meds is borderline euphoric, like Bradley Cooper in Limitless.  I get everything done, everything seems fun and exciting, I'm not worried or anxious about social situations, and I just enjoy each day.After about a month, I start to feel numb.  I'm tired, depressed, unmotivated, and each day feels like a new challenge.  I'm not spontaneous or goofy like my usual self.  We've tried changing the dose and switched to Ritalin/Vyvanse/Concerta/Wellbutrin/Propranolol/Celexa and everything else, but this always happens.  I'm now on the highest dose I've ever been on, but I'm incredibly tired and depressed this past week.  **Am I on too high of a dose?

"Hi there,So I was reading a document on how to deal with blood-related fainting reactions. Basically, I faint when I see (lots of) blood, I've had it most of my life. It has gotten less over the years, and I have never done anything to try and lessen the reaction. By coincidence I found a text on the subject which recommended flexing stomach muscles if you could feel a fainting reaction coming on. I tried it a couple of times and it seems to work. The idea is that it increases blood flow to the brain, and thus makes you less likely to faint. The thing is, I found that it also works for types of anxiety, I've always been anxious towards public speaking, and now when I do so I flex my stomach muscles, and it actually makes me feel more confident and more daring.      Is this placebo or something else? It might be a good suggestion for others to try this too, it might work for you as well.

Today, I leave for vacation to go to a huge outdoor cocktail party tomorrow and then a huge tailgate the next day. I plan to drink heavily both days, and I have a few concerns:Is drinking on Concerta safe? I did some googling and it seems that people argue both ways. My pharmacist told me that when mixed with alcohol, the extended release component is broken down more quickly and so the 54mg is released much quicker, which could potentially cause an issue. In response to this, I figured my best option would be to either not take my Concerta for these two days, or just take a smaller dose like 18mg. I'm worried, though, that skipping two days of the medication after taking it for two weeks could be bad though.Is it safe to drink on? And if not, is it okay to skip two days?

"I was recently prescribed 36mg concerta and it wasn't really doing anything for me. I kinda just felt sad/slightly depressed by the end of the night and kind of burnt out. I thought maybe increasing my dosage to 54mg (3x 18mg) would help and I did start to see the effects. I was able to focus and conversate with people but after 4 hrs I started feeling tired and depressed.I've been taking the 54mg for 2 weeks now and I'm about to see my psychiatrist again soon to possibly change meds. I did some research on ritalin/concerta and read that it's similar to the structure of cocaine. I won't lie I've experimented with coke before a couple years ago and the feeling it made me wasn't even close to how the concerta is making me feel right now.So my question is, why is it okay to take ritalin/concerta everyday but it's bad to say snort lines everyday? I know ritalin/concerta increase dopamine in the brain, if it's always doing that won't you constantly feel burnt out?

"I'm having a bit of a mental block and I need help.A few months ago I started entertaining the idea that I have a problem. I read several books on addiction and booze, went to some AA meetings, and generally spend a lot of time trying to understand my relationship with alcohol.I cut back in a big way-- stopped going to bars as frequently, stopped buying booze at home, stopped drinking alone. My girlfriend and my closest friends are all supportive of my decision to cut back, and I'm very proud of the changes I've made. My life has undeniably changed for the better.So now it's time to quit entirely. I'm ready. I'm officially 2 days sober, but I **hate** the fact that it feels so short.

When I'm in a negative mood, I feel really grumpy and don't feel like talking to people, and when someone does try to talk to me, I just get annoyed and ignore them, even though they haven't done anything. I also worry about how my future will turn out e.g. I think that I'll struggle to find a girlfriend and end up being alone. However, when my mood improves, I'm happy to be around other people, and generally have a more positive outlook on my future. I also worry less about the way others perceive me. Sometimes, the mood swings occur quite frequently e.g. within a matter of minutes, and sometimes I can be grumpy for a few days, before being happy for the next few days etc. I wouldn't say they are severe mood swings i.e. I don't feel depressed or suicidal when I'm in a negative mood, nor do I feel full of energy and hyperactive when I'm in a positive mood. However, they are 'powerful' enough to make my day miserable, and the frequency of them is annoying and can sometimes hold me back from getting things done.

It's a weekday; my brother, mother, and myself are all sitting around. My mom is watching TV, I'm on my computer, and my brother is watching Netflix in his room.

It tingles, and it sends a shiver up my neck. It tells me that death in inevitable, and it tells me I will be sad forever. My friends are all hanging out, but everything they do seems to bother me. They all act hostile towards each other and argue over little things. It's like nobody knows how to be friendly anymore. I hate summer. It makes my eyes well just thinking about it.

It's not about changing them, it's about asking yourself if you can accept them for who they are and what they do and can do for you.

Now, though, one of them is starting very soon, and I'm starting to feel anxious thinking about it and am having second thoughts.It's a yoga club. I've never done yoga before and know very little about it. I don't even own a yoga mat. Plus, there will probably be way more women than men there (and I'm a guy) which might make things awkward. I also have nobody I know to go with. I don't know, I'm feeling suddenly very reluctant. I know these thoughts are irrational, but I'm not sure what to do to lessen them. Suggestions?

"How do you tell the difference between paranoia and a very bad case of anxiety? My understanding is that while anxiety can cause you to have irrational thoughts (everyone hates me, people probably gossip about me, etc.), paranoia involves greater feelings of persecution. That someone or something (or the world) is out to get you, that your reputation is in danger, that your life is a series of calculated moves to avoid being caught, exposed, or foiled, and that you're just waiting for something to slip up. There's a greater element of secrecy and mistrust involved. The way I understand it though, with paranoia you also think you're completely and totally normal; you have no suspicion that your behavior *isn't* normal, and those thoughts of self-awareness never even cross your mind.   So how do you distinguish between the two?

I wrapped the slack around the handles a few times to get the collar as high as possible. I slipped my head through the collar and leaned in different direction to see which choked me the most.

I was taking the ER 10mg for a while and then switched over to the 20mg IR after talking to my doctor and have been taking it for about 2 years now.I've felt like the Adderall may be contributing to my social anxiety or causing social withdrawal.

I opened my arms to her and she embraced me. I was holding her for the short time that it was. This touch I've been longing for, knowing what healing properties it has or just to make me feel that I'm all right. That's when I hear her starting to cry. I feel terrible once again, seeing as this interaction had the bizzaro effect on her. Brings me nothing but sadness.

Characteristics of a good course could include instant feedback, lots of interactivity (e.g. quizzes, short assignments), lectures/notes broken down into short topics, course available 'on-demand', active discussions boards and so on.  As an example, I found [MITx's Intro to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-8) quite good. The lecture videos are split up so each topic is covered in less than 20 mins (making it easy to focus on when first learning and easy to go back and reference later). There was also lots of mini quizzes and assignments. The only downside is that the material was released week by week - I would have a ton of motivation, do four weeks then run out of assignments/lectures then wait a month until doing another couple of weeks all at once (instead of working through it week by week like you're suppose to).

There seems to be very mixed reviews online about courses like this, with some calling them brainwashing cults (which is fundamentally what they're *for*; to break down the way you think and replace it with better coping strategies), others saying it's like a pyramid type scheme for your psychological health, being pressured to attend more and more seminars or risk 'reverting' back to feeling low and depressed, and that that's what they depend on, while others say they've changed peoples lives for the better.I'm very cautious, and hoped someone here may have experience, or input?**Examples and Information** * [LGATs](http://skepdic.com/lgsap.html)* [LGAT Experience](http://www.culthelp.info/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=965&amp;Itemid=12)* [More to Life](http://moretolife.org.uk/about-our-courses/weekend/)* [Newspaper article on 'Landmark'](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/dec/14/ameliahill.theobserver)* [6 Harmful Truths about LGATs](http://lgattruth.blogspot.co.uk/2006/11/six-danger-signs-of-harmful-lgats.html)Thank you for your time. :)

This new app is based on exposure therapy, one of the most effective behavioral techniques for overcoming social anxiety. Lots of people may have told you to go and face your fears, but that often does not work. This app helps you create a fear hierarchy - where you ranked your feared situations from least to most scary. Then, you start at the bottom of the fear hierarchy and make your way up. Another common mistake is to leave while your body is still in a state of anxiety. To help you complete the feared activities, this app has an interactive module that guides you through the activity and ensures that you stay there until your anxiety dies down (as it inevitably will). Let me know what you think and if you have any questions I will be happy to answer them in the comments. Good luck!

Prior to this I had severe sweating, confusion/agitation, muscle spasming, visual problems, nausea/vomiting/squits, and difficulty walking/staying up-right.

"Hi, I'm 17 years old. I don't think I have ADHD but I do, it seems, share a trait with some of the people that do. In short, I cannot stick to things for any longer than 1-2 months (if that).I get passionate about stuff and launch in, then lose interest quickly, get bored and drop it.I just read a post about a guy with ADHD who suggested trying a dynamic, constantly changing hobby such as photography, fashion, sport etc.I love writing. I write a lot online and I'm always excited by the possibility of penning something for an audience. I also love fashion, but I'm not artistic or fashionable enough to do it for a career. I decided to smush them together and try my hand at fashion blogging (even if no one reads it) - trying to stick with it for at least a month.What do you guys think? Is it a good idea? Do any of you have experience with what I described? Do you have any advice?Sorry for posting this in r/ADHD but I didn't really know where else to post it, I hope it doesn't cause any offence.

But at the same time, I have no motivation, I have trouble completing even simple tasks and I spend my nights/weekends lounging around instead of getting stuff done.

So my question is this: has anyone ever felt like they had all the symptoms of depression without feeling sad or unhappy?

I can't get anything done till this time passes.I'm struggling to use what I know about how concerta works (the timing of drug release) to figure out what's going on/what a solution might be. Is there too little of the drug at that time and I'd maybe benefit from a supplementary IR tablet?

Anyway, aside from finding someone you get along with/like, I was wondering for those of you who have good therapists:What did you look for when finding them? Does your therapist have a lot of experience with *adult* ADHD, mostly kids w/ ADHD, or not much experience at all?I'm finding that if they do specialize in it, their focus is children and adolescents. Should I just go with someone who has little experience with it but works with adults or try the children's one if they'll take me?

She told me she is the happiest she has been in years and she appreciated everyone caring for her. People are scared for her. I said I wished her the best and was really glad to hear that she was happy. Is this normal during mania? Abandoning friendship and close family ties?

"Quit LoL recently after 4 years of hard grinding day and night. At first I didn't even plan to quit, but I was getting less and less focused on LoL and reading about engineering things on Quora during queue time. Eventually stopped playing completely and sold my account.Now enrolled at a community college and excited to continue my schooling where I left off 6 years ago, and have been having fun exploring the city and applying for jobs. Adjusting to be more social was tough at first but now I don't struggle with depression like I did while playing, and I notice how much time is actually in the day.Feels really good to have stopped playing and my only regret is I didn't stop earlier. In the future I hope they have more services to help people quit games similar to Alcohol Anonymous or other drug programs.

Anecdotally, lots of people are quitting by vaping. Further, I think folks have some good advice for getting down to 0mg nicotine.

I was, though, a little disappointed with what seemed like an attempt to dull down the subject to make it comply with MTV's typical standards (cutesy covers of pop songs, arbitrary romances, cheesy this and that).

"Is it normal to experience extreme fatigue/sluggishness during kratom use, tapering, and discontinuation? Regardless of the stage, the tiredness is debilitating. Sleep is all I think about and laying down even 2 mins leads to unbearable sleepiness. This I thought would be expected during initial drawls but it's an everyday thing and occurs even when taking kratom. I'm wondering if this is caused by the brains chemistry being changed after years of use and a typical effect experience by others in similar situation, or whether this may be separate from kratom/opiate sideeffects and possibly something else at play. I could literally sleep all day everyday but since I can't do that I go week by week battling sleep and fatigue at every waking hour. Do others experience this as well?

I always think of the perfect world where she would be my girlfriend/wife or something, but I also have a confusing problem where I want to be her? Like, I wish instead of being born as myself I wish I was born as her and lived her life. This makes me very depressed and it's a very weird/confusing state to be in. Does anybody else have this?

Im trying to push through and stay on it as ive heard it can pass and get better soon but im extremely skeptical. Does anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences surrounding this medication?

I wake up and pray, I go to a meeting every day, I try to be if service in some small way without telling anyone about it, and I talk to another addict/alcoholic everyday that is living this way also, one day at a time.I went to a meeting last night and the young woman sharing told a lot of my story, and was asked by a young man afterwards to help guide him on the path. I felt humbled and honored, and I saw myself, both in him and in the speakers story.That is the gift of this thing, my dark past has become the greatest asset I have. As we all know, junk is just another 9-5 gig, the hours are just a little more inclined to shadows. We are in this fight together, and it is in that fellowship that I find a piece of my strength.Love and Light to all of you, you are appreciated.

It is a feeling that something you like will be taken from you. It is a feeling that you are in physical danger, etc...Continue to break these things down until you realize that they are just ideas and they cannot hurt you if you don't let them. you can do this with anything from what are relationships to what is the meaning of my life.

It's time for me to go cold turkey on this, I have too many responsibilities  demanding my time now (kids, wife, work) but I still feel a nagging compulsion to fire up steam and blow away my evening hours... it's a damaging neurosis and it needs to stop: I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same single-player boat with me?

"I'm wondering if anybody had similar experiences-I got on Lexapro shortly after my move to quell the anxiety I started experiencing about finding my own identity in a new place-fast forward a few weeks and my boyfriend noticed ever since I got on it that I have very low lows every once in a while and never had problems with moodiness in the past.

It's important to say that these tremors/involuntary movements are mostly internal if it makes sense, they are not usually visible (sometimes they are, but slightly) and more pronounced when I'm trying to relax, to sit still. It's like some neurons randomly fire and produce those twitches. <e1>My main concern is eyes tremor"" feeling</e1> as <e2>it produces very unpleasant agitation-like state - I can't relax at all and have difficulties falling asleep</e2>.

I am currently deleting all games from my pc (don't own any consoles atm) so steam, blizzard, random facebook games (I know I know you might say those don't count but still) and even deleting them makes me feel more empty but I know it's something I have to do.

She is getting help through therapy and medication.  I just want to know what is the best way for me to respond in those tough moments?  I know I can't leave.

I almost felt the urge to jump and give up, but I stopped myself from thinking about that because I have to finish the photoshoot.Throughout the whole process, people passing by would greet me and asked if I am taking pictures. In my eyes, it appears pretty obvious that I was taking pictures with the tripod and camera right there.Why are they still asking? Are they doing that to be friendly? Or are they doing that because they picked up that I am crumbly depressed and just to confirm that I am actually taking taking the picture (and not something else)?

"Hey everyone,Since I turned 21 (I'm like 22.5 now), I've started to drink more and more heavily. I've just recently began to admit to myself that it might actually be a problem (I've had a couple of S.O.'s break up with me over it actually, probably should have realized a long time ago...) Anyways, at my peak I was drinking around 10-12 shots in a night. Over the past weeks I've dropped it down to half of that by myself, and decided that I could make a full stop as of yesterday.So here I am, at 2:30 in the morning, with a minor headache, totally unable to sleep.

To those of you who, like myself, are experiencing distress over distancing yourself from emotionally abusive family, please listen. It's ok. It's ok that you don't want to spend time with them. It's ok if you avoid family, when seeing them causes nothing but stress and triggers some bad things mentally. It's ok to choose your own family. There are plenty of decent loving humans out there who would be happy to be a part of your chosen family. It's ok if you hurt your birth family's feelings by avoiding them, if avoiding them is necessary for your emotional and psychological wellbeing. I don't know if any of you needed this.

I'm also in my 20's and my parents are able to see my purchases.

"Long story short: Tylenol #3 (Codeine-Apap 30-300) habit for 2 years I'd estimate... Stopped Friday night and I'm quite concerned I won't make it past the drug screening for Tuesday. I'm applying for maintenance at a school district and leaving (hopefully) my job as a pharmacy technician (I'm sure you see why my current job conflicts with my goals).Withdrawal symptoms are mostly manageable. There's a few things I'm having trouble (and have had trouble in the past) coping with. Joint/back pain: APAP and NSAIDs really don't seem to help. Exercise helps in that moment, and then I lay awake all night wondering why I did that to myself. Headache: APAP seems to help, but not long enough.Obviously my main concern is just passing the screening. Most websites claim codeine becomes undetectable to drug screening in about 72 hours. Does anyone have experience with this?

You're subject to what's happening and can't use any coping skills or grounding techniques.I had a nightmare earlier wherein a girl from my work and a group of friends got in trouble with the law and I ended up being held at gunpoint. The room was spinning like it does whenever I have weed-induced panic attacks, and the dissociation was so intense it felt like one of those panic attacks.I was sobbing and screaming that I wanted to live (despite constant suicidal thoughts), and it took my dream-version of my boyfriend to convince the person holding me at gunpoint to get me back.I remember running back into my boyfriend's arms and the world was still spinning and the depersonalization was so intense that I would have likened it to an Out-of-body experience.I woke up shaken and slightly afraid. I woke up grounded, but I still felt as if I had just recovered from a bad panic attack blackout.I dunno, just wanted to come here and say something to you guys.
